This series\nwill explain some of the technical aspects of the Particl platform in a way that\neverybody can understand. These articles should give you a good base knowledge\nof the more technical features of the platform and can serve as pointers when\nexplaining a feature to a new community member or user of the platform.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency with varying levels of anonymity. In\nfact, using two different privacy protocols, users of the PART coin can choose\nbetween 3 types of transactions (public, blinded, anonymous) when making\npayments to other people or to addresses they own. Each of these transaction\ntypes carries its own level of privacy as well as its own set of properties.\n\nThis article will break down each of these transaction types and go into more\ndetails about them, explaining why and when you should use them. Privacy\ntransactions on Particl should have no secret for you anymore after reading\nthis!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Content (Click Me)\n * Public Transactions\n * Blinded Transactions (CT)\n * Rangeproofs\n * Bulletproofs\n * Anonymous Transactions  (RingCT)\n * Ring Signatures (MLSAG)\n * How to Make an Anonymous Transaction (RingCT) on Particl Desktop\n * Keeping a Good Level of Privacy\n * Stealth Addresses\n * CT + RingCT Together = Infinite Possibilities\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPublic Transactions\n * Privacy level: Low\n * Transaction cost: Low (~0.000346 PART)\n * Segwit: Yes (Reduces transactions weight by ~20%)\n * Trusted setup: No\n * Programmable outputs: Yes\n\n(Fee: 0.000346 PART)By default, when not manually selecting any privacy protocol\nto obfuscate your transactions on the blockchain, transactions are sent out as\n“public transactions”. And because Particl is based on the Bitcoin codebase,\nthey are recorded on the blockchain the same way you would expect Bitcoin\ntransactions to be recorded.\n\nContrary to what a lot of people claim, Bitcoin is not anonymous. In fact, it is\nquite the contrary. Bitcoin transactions (and Particl transactions, by proxy)\nare what we call pseudonymous transactions and they are pretty transparent.\nInstead of each transaction being tied to a personal identity, it is instead\ntied to an alphanumerical pseudonym composed of various different numbers and\ncharacters.\n\nWhile that is probably enough to protect your data from uninterested parties,\nthe advent of solid blockchain analysis tools and protocols makes it way too\neasy for any curious and motivated party to start digging into the blockchain\nand tracking users. That becomes dramatically easier the moment you make a\npayment to any service that ties addresses to identities (exchanges, payment\nprocessors, vendors, etc.).\n\nFor this reason, the Particl team has implemented two different privacy\nprotocols that make currency transactions hidden on the blockchain. Both of\nthese protocols do not require any trusted setup and have common denominators,\nbut also have different purposes within the Particl platform as well as\ndifferent levels of privacy.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBlinded Transactions — Confidential Transactions (CT)\nConfidential Transactions\n[https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions]\nElements - An open source, sidechain-capable blockchain platform.\nelementsproject.org\n[https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions]\n\n * Privacy level: Medium (Transacting amounts are hidden)\n * Transaction cost: Medium (~0.001962 PART)\n * Segwit: Yes (Reduces CT transactions weight by ~48%)\n * Bulletproofs: Yes (Reduces range proofs size by ~70%)\n * Trusted setup: No\n * Programmable outputs: Yes\n * Whitepaper: \n   https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\n\n(Fee: 0.001962 PART)Blinded transactions are currency transactions that have their transacting\namounts hidden on the blockchain and only known by the two transacting parties\n(the sender and the receiver). This type of transaction uses the Confidential\nTransactions (CT)\n[https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation] \nprivacy protocol which cryptographically guarantees that no more coins can be\nspent than are available. It uses a zero-knowledge proofing method that does not\nrequire any trusted setup or direct interaction with the party.\n\nSending a blinded transaction (CT) on Particl DesktopThis privacy protocol is\nentirely trustless, meaning that it doesn’t require any trusted setup\n[https://minezcash.com/zcash-trusted-setup/] and doesn’t require the assistance\nof any intermediary to process transactions. The problem with privacy protocols\nrequiring so-called “trusted setups [https://minezcash.com/zcash-trusted-setup/]\n” is that they require a one-time setup that involves the generation and use of \nmaster keys. Users then need to put trust in whoever generated those keys to\ndestroy them right after they are done setting up the protocol, otherwise, those\nkeys could be used to create an unlimited amount of coins and do so without\nanyone noticing it.\n\nTo prove and ensure that amounts being sent and received are positive and the\ncorrect ones, Confidential Transactions use what we call a rangeproof. In other\nwords, a rangeproof is able to determine that the amount of coins sent in a\ngiven transaction is between two values, but it’s not able to tell exactly what\nthat amount is.\n\nRangeproofs\nA rangeproof is a cryptographic protocol used to verify that a payment amount is\npositive or zero, without actually revealing the amount transferred in the\ntransaction. Without rangeproofs, the amounts in a transaction could be set so\nlarge that it would be considered a negative number, thus allowing coins to be\ngenerated out of thin air. An attacker could add a negative amount output and\nanother different output, generating extra coins. The negative output would make\nthe commitments still sum to zero.\n\nThe downside with rangeproofs is that they are quite heavy on the blockchain.\nTheir size scales linearly with the number of outputs in a transaction and the\nbits in the proof’s range. In fact, due to their heavy nature, rangeproofs take\nup the majority of a blinded transaction’s size.\n\nThis inconvenient reality means anyone looking into using the protocol will have\nto execute bigger transactions than regular, public ones. A bigger transaction\nnot only means higher fees, but it also means that the size of the blockchain\ngrows exponentially along with usage. In other words, it gets more inconvenient\nto run the blockchain as more and more CT transactions get recorded on it.\n\nThis scalability issue is one of the main reasons why the Particl team has\nrefrained from moving its RingCT implementation onto Particl’s mainnet. Because\nthis project has a long-term vision in mind, it was preferred to wait until a\nproper solution to this scalability problem was found. And then came\nBulletproofs.\n\nBulletproofs\n * Whitepaper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf\n * Report from Quarkslab audit into Particl’s implementation of Bulletproofs: \n   https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\n\nBulletproofs is a new generation of rangeproofs that scale logarithmically\nrather than linearly. In its whitepaper [https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf],\nthey are referred to as non-interactive zero-knowledge short proofs. In simple\nterms, Bulletproofs is a groundbreaking improvement over regular rangeproofs as \nthey reduce their size by around ~70%. And, because rangeproofs make up for the\nmajority of a CT transaction size, it in turn reduces transaction fees and the\nspace they take on the blockchain by the same ratio.\n\n> Fun fact: The term “Bulletproofs” was coined by Shashank Agrawal when he\ndescribed the new type of rangeproof as “short like a bullet, with bulletproof\nsecurity assumption”.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnonymous Transactions — RingCT\n * Privacy level: High (Transacting amounts and participants are hidden)\n * Transaction cost: Medium to high, depending on the number of mixins used in\n   the ring signatures or the size of the rings\n * Transaction cost for low privacy setting: ~0.003232 PART\n * Transaction cost for high privacy setting: ~0.009032 PART\n * Segwit: Yes (Reduces transaction weight by ~47%)\n * Bulletproofs: Yes (Reduces rangeproofs size by ~70%)\n * Trusted setup: No\n * Programmable outputs: No\n * Whitepaper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf\n\n(Fee: 0.005708 PART for 8 ring members and 2 inputs)Anonymous transactions, or Anon transactions, as referred to in Particl Desktop,\ntake privacy to the next level by not only hiding the transacting amounts but\nalso the identity of the transacting parties (the sender and the receiver). This\ntype of transaction uses the RingCT privacy protocol, a protocol made popular by\nMonero but adapted to work with the Bitcoin codebase by the Particl team. This\nallows the platform to benefit from the industry-leading privacy protocol that\nis RingCT but still leverage the security, stability, and developer community of\nBitcoin. In other words, RingCT on the Bitcoin codebase is like having your cake\nand eating it too. The good, without the bad.\n\nSending an anon transaction (RingCT) with 22 ring members on Particl DesktopGood\nexamples of this include RingCT being able to be used, with the help of special\nscripts, on atomic swaps, decentralized applications (i.e. Particl’s Open\nMarketplace), the Lightning Network, and etc. It also enables RingCT to be\ndirectly linked to CT transactions so that it can reach full programmability, as\nwe’ll see later in this article.\n\nJust like blinded transactions, which use the CT protocol, anonymous\ntransactions are entirely trustless and don’t rely on any sort of trusted setup.\nIt’s important to note that RingCT transactions are also a bit bigger than\nConfidential Transactions, although not by a big margin. This is due to the\naddition of ring signatures (MLSAG) into the mix.\n\n> Fun fact: RingCT was initially implemented on top of the Cryptonote codebase\n(Monero). The Particl team is the first team to ever develop a custom\nimplementation that could work on any other codebase, in this case, the Bitcoin\ncodebase.\nRing Signatures (MLSAG)\n * Report from Quarkslab audit into Particl’s implementation of MLSAG: \n   https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\n\nMultilayered Linkable Spontaneous Ad-Hoc Group Signatures (MLSAG), or ring\nsignatures, is the Ring part of RingCT. It is a type of digital signature that\nis performed by many outputs at once within a given group of RingCT outputs \n(represented by Anon balances, on Particl Desktop). It is then impossible for\nany observer to tell which of the participating outputs within that signature is\nthe output actually sending out the transaction.\n\nWikipedia describes ring signatures as follow\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_signature]: “A ring signature is a type of \ndigital signature [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature] that can be\nperformed by any member of a group of users that each have keys. Therefore, a\nmessage signed with a ring signature is endorsed by someone in a particular\ngroup of people. One of the security properties of a ring signature is that it\nshould be computationally infeasible to determine which of the group members’\nkeys was used to produce the signature.”.\n\nIn RingCT’s case, the digital signature used to execute a transaction could have\noriginated from any member of the ring group. Users put some of their funds\nwithin an Anon balance. Funds held within an Anon balance are used to execute\nRingCT transactions. Before a transaction is executed, the protocol anonymously\nsigns it by using other RingCT outputs as decoys and produces a signature that,\nwhen verified, looks like it could have been initiated by any of the owners of\nthe RingCT outputs used by the ring group. It is not possible to know who really\nmade the transaction because it could be anyone that has an output that’s being\nused by the ring group as a decoy.\n\nThis effectively anonymizes all values contained within a transaction— the\namount transferred as well as both the transaction’s sender and receiver. It\nalso arms transacting parties with a very strong plausible deniability (1\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability], 2\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption]).\n\nHow to Make an Anonymous Transaction (RingCT) on Particl Desktop\nA RingCT transaction containing 24 ring membersOn Particl Desktop, it is\npossible to pick the number of members you want to have within the ring group \nyou’re going to use to anonymize your transactions. On the client, this is\nreferred to as NO. OF RING SIGS.\n\nWhat it means is simple, for every input used to generate your transaction, a\nnumber of other outputs will be used to create a digital signature that could\nhave been signed by any of the 24 participants. In the screenshot just above,\nthe value 24 is selected. This means 23 fake outputs, and 1 real one (the sender\nof the transaction) will be used to obfuscate the transaction (if it only has 1\ninput). If the transaction uses 3 inputs, it means 3 signatures, one for each\ninput, with 3 different ring groups of 24 participants each, will be generated\nin order to execute the transactions. This may sound complicated, but don’t\nworry, Particl Desktop does everything for you and makes RingCT transactions as\neasy to send as any other type of transaction.\n\nTo make a RingCT transaction, simply go into your Send/Convert tab, choose the\nAnontransaction type, click the Advanced Options, and use the PRIVACY LEVEL (NO.\nOF RING SIGS) slider that appears at the bottom left corner of the page. The\nvalue you pick will be equal to the number of ring members that will be part of\nyour ring group. In reality, you can just leave the slider untouched and use the\ndefault level of privacy (8 ring members). This represents a good balance\nbetween privacy and cost.\n\n> Note: The more inputs are consumed to execute a RingCT transaction, the more\nexpensive it gets, but also the more private it is. Also, the more ring members\n(RING SIGS) is selected before executing a transaction, the more expensive it\ngets, but also the more private it is. If you don’t care about the cost of a\ntransaction and just want maximum privacy, form transactions with as many ring\nmembers as possible and with as many inputs as possible.\nKeeping a Good Level of Privacy\nAs a general rule of thumb and in theory, RingCT gets more private as more\npeople convert their public balances into Anon balances, thus creating more Anon \noutputs to be used by ring groups for RingCT transactions. That’s because RingCT\nrelies on other people’s outputs to plausibly deny which output actually signed\na transaction, and the more RingCT outputs there are to sign transactions, the\nstronger the privacy and plausible deniability aspect of RingCT gets.\n\nBut, while outputs are randomly picked from any Anon outputs in the chain,\nthey’re most often picked from the most recent RingCT transactions. The reason\nthe protocol behaves this way is in response to this research paper\n[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/] which demonstrates that real inputs can be\nguessed to be the most recent ones if all the “mixins” are much deeper in the\nchain and haven’t had transactions for a while.\n\nFor this reason, it is recommended that all users keep with them an Anon balance \nwhich can be automatically put to use by the network (at no fee to the users, of\ncourse). Additionally, it is also recommended that users transact as much as\npossible with Anon transactions so that it can contribute to enhancing the\nentire network’s privacy. Note that none of this is required in order to execute\na RingCT transaction, but the more people do it, the stronger and more resilient\nit becomes for everyone.\n\nThis is also one of the main reason why Particl’s Open Marketplace is going to\nuse RingCT transactions, by default, on all marketplace transactions. The best\nway to increase the RingCT pool is through transactional activity and actual\nusage of the technology, so making it default on what will become the platform’s\nmain application is only logical and will go a long way into making Particl’s\nRingCT protocol a very solid one.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStealth Addresses\nAdditionally, Particl allows anyone to use stealth addresses instead of regular,\npublic addresses. Stealth addresses are one-time addresses that increase privacy\nbecause only the owner of a stealth address can tell if an output belongs to it\nor not. What is meant by “one-time address” is that a stealth address can\nreceive payments many times, but each time, it generates a new ‘one-time\naddress’ for that output/transaction.\n\nWithout knowing the private key of an address, an observer won’t be able to link\nand guess which outputs match which stealth address. This helps in protecting\nthe identity of the receiver of a transaction.\n\nOn their own, stealth addresses probably aren’t enough to protect transactions\ninformation from any well-funded and motivated observer (i.e. state actor), but\nwhen combined with stronger privacy protocols such as CT or RingCT, it provides\nyet another layer of privacy for the user.\n\nAs it currently stands, blinded (CT) and anon (RingCT) transactions can only be\nexecuted to stealth addresses.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCT + RingCT Together = Infinite Possibilities\nBoth privacy protocols have their own pros and cons, but one of the most notable\ndifferences between the two Particl implementations is the fact that CT has\nprogrammable outputs while RingCT does not. What that means is that RingCT, as\nis, simply cannot be used within smart-contracts. What that does not mean,\nhowever, is that it cannot be used within decentralized applications. How is\nthat possible, if RingCT cannot be used in smart-contracts? This is one of the\nbig reasons why Particl keeps both CT and RingCT protocols on its network\ninstead of just one of them.\n\nIn fact, because CT transactions have programmable outputs, they can be used in\nsmart-contracts and then easily be linked to RingCT transactions. The benefit of\nParticl’s implementation is that the outputs can be spent from RingCT to CT for\nanything requiring a script, and then be sent back to RingCT.\n\nThe best example to illustrate this concept is with Particl’s Open Marketplace.\nIt is a private-by-default marketplace that uses RingCT to completely anonymize\nmarketplace transactions. What few people know is that the marketplace actually\nuses a combination of RingCT (the transaction) and CT (the smart-contract) for\nits escrow system, not RingCT.\n\nThat’s because the marketplace’s escrow system is based on smart-contract\nfunctionality, thus requiring transactions to have programmable outputs (hence\nwhy it uses CT). However, to interact with the smart-contract, users need to\nsend a RingCT transaction to it, which the marketplace then automatically\nconverts into a CT transaction for the duration of the escrow. Once it gets\nreleased by the two transacting parties, the transaction is finalized as a\nRingCT transaction.\n\n> A RingCT output is converted to a CT output which in turn forms the inputs of\nthe escrow contract. When the escrow is ready to be released or refunded, it\nwill directly be released to a RingCT output.— Kewde [https://github.com/kewde/]\n, Particl Developer and OMP Library\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/]Author\nThis is just one example of how RingCT can be given its full potential and\nleverage the Particl and Bitcoin ecosystems using its CT counterpart. The same\nsort of technique can be applied to integrate RingCT into other protocols or\nservices such as atomic swaps, the Lightning Network, other decentralized\napplications, and etc.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you liked this article, share it wide and beyond and stay tuned as more \nParticl Explained articles will be posted on particl.news [http://particl.news] \nin the future.\n\nThe Particl team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

And because Particl is based on the Bitcoin codebase, they are recorded on the blockchain the same way you would expect Bitcoin transactions to be recorded.</p><p><strong>Contrary to what a lot of people claim, Bitcoin is not anonymous</strong>. In fact, it is quite the contrary. Bitcoin transactions (and Particl transactions, by proxy) are what we call <strong>pseudonymous</strong> transactions and they are pretty transparent. Instead of each transaction being tied to a personal identity, it is instead tied to an alphanumerical pseudonym composed of various different numbers and characters.</p><p>While that is probably enough to protect your data from uninterested parties, the advent of solid blockchain analysis tools and protocols makes it way too easy for any curious and motivated party to start digging into the blockchain and tracking users. That becomes dramatically easier the moment you make a payment to any service that ties addresses to identities (exchanges, payment processors, vendors, etc.).</p><p>For this reason, the Particl team has implemented two different privacy protocols that make currency transactions hidden on the blockchain. Both of these protocols do not require any trusted setup and have common denominators, but also have different purposes within the Particl platform as well as different levels of privacy.</p><hr><h2 id=\"blinded-transactions-confidential-transactions-ct-\">Blinded Transactions — Confidential Transactions (CT)</h2><p><a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions\"><strong>Confidential Transactions</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions\"><em>Elements - An open source, sidechain-capable blockchain platform.</em>elementsproject.org</a></p><ul><li><em>Privacy level: <strong>Medium (Transacting amounts are hidden)</strong></em></li><li><em>Transaction cost: <strong>Medium (~0.001962 PART)</strong></em></li><li><em>Segwit: <strong>Yes (Reduces CT transactions weight by ~48%)</strong></em></li><li><em>Bulletproofs: <strong>Yes (Reduces range proofs size by ~70%)</strong></em></li><li><em>Trusted setup: <strong>No</strong></em></li><li><em>Programmable outputs: <strong>Yes</strong></em></li><li><em>Whitepaper: </em><a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\"><em><strong>https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation</strong></em></a></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained---Private-Transactions/1-APY4j-vFVOhMr-V0rm30xQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>(Fee: 0.001962 PART)</figcaption></figure><p>Blinded transactions are <strong>currency transactions that have their transacting amounts hidden on the blockchain</strong> and only known by the two transacting parties (the sender and the receiver). This type of transaction uses the <a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\"><strong>Confidential Transactions (CT)</strong></a> privacy protocol which cryptographically guarantees that no more coins can be spent than are available. It uses a zero-knowledge proofing method that <strong>does not require any trusted setup or direct interaction with the party</strong>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained---Private-Transactions/1-q2ZhXl4uqiCXm9IfbIAQuA.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Sending a blinded transaction (CT) on Particl Desktop</figcaption></figure><p>This privacy protocol is entirely trustless, meaning that it doesn’t require any <a href=\"https://minezcash.com/zcash-trusted-setup/\"><strong>trusted setup</strong></a> and doesn’t require the assistance of any intermediary to process transactions. The problem with privacy protocols requiring so-called “<a href=\"https://minezcash.com/zcash-trusted-setup/\"><strong>trusted setups</strong></a>” is that they require a one-time setup that involves the generation and use of <em>master keys</em>. Users then need to put trust in whoever generated those keys to destroy them right after they are done setting up the protocol, otherwise, those keys could be used to create an unlimited amount of coins and do so without anyone noticing it.</p><p>To prove and ensure that amounts being sent and received are positive and the correct ones, Confidential Transactions use what we call a <strong>rangeproof. </strong>In other words, a rangeproof is able to determine that the amount of coins sent in a given transaction is between two values, but it’s not able to tell exactly what that amount is.</p><h3 id=\"rangeproofs\">Rangeproofs</h3><p>A rangeproof is a cryptographic protocol used to<strong> verify that a payment amount is positive or zero, without actually revealing the amount transferred in the transaction</strong>. Without rangeproofs, the amounts in a transaction could be set so large that it would be considered a negative number, thus allowing coins to be generated out of thin air. An attacker could add a negative amount output and another different output, generating extra coins. The negative output would make the commitments still sum to zero.</p><p>The downside with rangeproofs is that they are quite heavy on the blockchain. Their size scales linearly with the number of outputs in a transaction and the bits in the proof’s range. In fact, due to their heavy nature, <strong>rangeproofs take up the majority of a blinded transaction’s size</strong>.</p><p>This inconvenient reality means anyone looking into using the protocol will have to execute bigger transactions than regular, public ones. A bigger transaction not only means higher fees, but it also means that the size of the blockchain grows exponentially along with usage. In other words, it gets more inconvenient to run the blockchain as more and more CT transactions get recorded on it.</p><p>This scalability issue is one of the main reasons why the Particl team has refrained from moving its RingCT implementation onto Particl’s mainnet. Because this project has a long-term vision in mind, it was preferred to wait until a proper solution to this scalability problem was found. And then came Bulletproofs.</p><h3 id=\"bulletproofs\">Bulletproofs</h3><ul><li><em>Whitepaper: </em><a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf\"><em><strong>https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf</strong></em></a></li><li><em>Report from Quarkslab audit into Particl’s implementation of Bulletproofs: </em><a href=\"https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\"><em><strong>https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf</strong></em></a></li></ul><p>Bulletproofs is a new generation of rangeproofs that scale logarithmically rather than linearly.

In simple terms, Bulletproofs is a groundbreaking improvement over regular rangeproofs as <strong>they reduce their size by around ~70%</strong>. And, because rangeproofs make up for the majority of a CT transaction size, it in turn reduces transaction fees and the space they take on the blockchain by the same ratio.</p><blockquote><strong>Fun fact:</strong> The term “Bulletproofs” was coined by Shashank Agrawal when he described the new type of rangeproof as “short like a bullet, with bulletproof security assumption”.</blockquote><hr><h2 id=\"anonymous-transactions-ringct\">Anonymous Transactions — RingCT</h2><ul><li><em>Privacy level: <strong>High (Transacting amounts and participants are hidden)</strong></em></li><li><em>Transaction cost: <strong>Medium to high, depending on the number of mixins used in the ring signatures or the size of the rings</strong></em></li><li><em>Transaction cost for low privacy setting: <strong>~0.003232 PART</strong></em></li><li><em>Transaction cost for high privacy setting: <strong>~0.009032 PART</strong></em></li><li><em>Segwit: <strong>Yes (Reduces transaction weight by ~47%)</strong></em></li><li><em>Bulletproofs: <strong>Yes (Reduces rangeproofs size by ~70%)</strong></em></li><li><em>Trusted setup: <strong>No</strong></em></li><li><em>Programmable outputs: <strong>No</strong></em></li><li><em>Whitepaper: </em><a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf\"><em><strong>https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf</strong></em></a></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained---Private-Transactions/1-aaB2qgM8S6AwXW3l1_-9Mg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>(Fee: 0.005708 PART for 8 ring members and 2 inputs)</figcaption></figure><p>Anonymous transactions, or <em>Anon transactions</em>, as referred to in Particl Desktop, take privacy to the next level by <strong>not only hiding the transacting amounts but also the identity of the transacting parties</strong> (the sender and the receiver).

This allows the platform to benefit from the industry-leading privacy protocol that is RingCT but still leverage the security, stability, and developer community of Bitcoin. In other words, RingCT on the Bitcoin codebase is like having your cake and eating it too.

It’s important to note that RingCT transactions are also a bit bigger than Confidential Transactions, although not by a big margin. This is due to the addition of ring signatures (MLSAG) into the mix.</p><blockquote><strong>Fun fact: </strong>RingCT was initially implemented on top of the Cryptonote codebase (Monero). The Particl team is the first team to ever develop a custom implementation that could work on any other codebase, in this case, the Bitcoin codebase.</blockquote><h3 id=\"ring-signatures-mlsag-\">Ring Signatures (MLSAG)</h3><ul><li><em>Report from Quarkslab audit into Particl’s implementation of MLSAG: </em><a href=\"https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\"><em><strong>https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf</strong></em></a></li></ul><p><em>Multilayered Linkable Spontaneous Ad-Hoc Group Signatures</em> (MLSAG), or ring signatures, is the <em>Ring</em> part of <em>RingCT</em>. It is a <strong>type of digital signature that is performed by many outputs at once within a given group of RingCT outputs</strong> (represented by <em>Anon</em> balances, on Particl Desktop). It is then <strong>impossible for any observer to tell which of the participating outputs within that signature is the output actually sending out the transaction</strong>.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_signature\">Wikipedia describes ring signatures as follow</a>: “<em>A ring signature is a type of </em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature\"><em>digital signature</em></a><em> that can be performed by any member of a group of users that each have keys. Therefore, a message signed with a ring signature is endorsed by someone in a particular group of people. One of the security properties of a ring signature is that it should be computationally infeasible to determine which of the group members’ keys was used to produce the signature.</em>”.</p><p>In RingCT’s case, the digital signature used to execute a transaction could have originated from any member of the <em>ring group</em>. Users put some of their funds within an Anon balance. Funds held within an Anon balance are used to execute RingCT transactions. Before a transaction is executed, the protocol anonymously signs it by <strong>using other RingCT outputs as</strong> <strong>decoys</strong> and produces a signature that, when verified, looks like it could have been initiated by any of the owners of the RingCT outputs used by the <em>ring group</em>. <strong>It is not possible to know who really made the transaction because it could be anyone that has an output that’s being used by the </strong><em><strong>ring group </strong></em><strong>as a decoy</strong>.</p><p><strong>This effectively anonymizes all values contained within a transaction</strong>— the amount transferred as well as both the transaction’s sender and receiver. It also arms transacting parties with a very strong <strong>plausible deniability</strong> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability\"><strong>1</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption\"><strong>2</strong></a>).</p><h3 id=\"how-to-make-an-anonymous-transaction-ringct-on-particl-desktop\">How to Make an Anonymous Transaction (RingCT) on Particl Desktop</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained---Private-Transactions/1-9xtnttI8YayVWxIaQVlBgw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>A RingCT transaction containing 24 ring members</figcaption></figure><p>On Particl Desktop, it is possible to pick the number of members you want to have within the <em>ring group</em> you’re going to use to anonymize your transactions. On the client, this is referred to as <em>NO. OF RING SIGS</em>.</p><p>What it means is simple, <strong>for every input used to generate your transaction, a number of other outputs will be used to create a digital signature that could have been signed by any of the 24 participants</strong>. In the screenshot just above, the value 24 is selected. This means 23 fake outputs, and 1 real one (the sender of the transaction) will be used to obfuscate the transaction (if it only has 1 input). If the transaction uses 3 inputs, it means 3 signatures, one for each input, with 3 different <em>ring groups </em>of 24 participants each,<em> </em>will be generated in order to execute the transactions. This may sound complicated, but don’t worry, Particl Desktop does everything for you and makes RingCT transactions as easy to send as any other type of transaction.</p><p><strong>To make a RingCT transaction</strong>, simply go into your Send/Convert tab, choose the Anontransaction type, click the Advanced Options, and use the PRIVACY LEVEL (NO. OF RING SIGS) slider that appears at the bottom left corner of the page. The value you pick will be equal to the number of <em>ring members</em> that will be part of your <em>ring group</em>. In reality, you can just leave the slider untouched and use the default level of privacy (8 <em>ring members</em>). This represents a good balance between privacy and cost.</p><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>The more inputs are consumed to execute a RingCT transaction, the more expensive it gets, but also the more private it is. Also, the more ring members (RING SIGS) is selected before executing a transaction, the more expensive it gets, but also the more private it is. If you don’t care about the cost of a transaction and just want maximum privacy, form transactions with as many ring members as possible and with as many inputs as possible.</blockquote><h3 id=\"keeping-a-good-level-of-privacy\">Keeping a Good Level of Privacy</h3><p>As a general rule of thumb and in theory, <strong>RingCT gets more private as more people convert their public balances into </strong>Anon<strong> balances</strong>, thus creating more <em>Anon</em> outputs to be used by <em>ring groups</em> for RingCT transactions. That’s because RingCT relies on other people’s outputs to plausibly deny which output actually signed a transaction, and <strong>the more RingCT outputs there are to sign transactions, the stronger the privacy and plausible deniability aspect of RingCT gets</strong>.</p><p>But, while outputs are randomly picked from any Anon outputs in the chain, they’re most often picked from the most recent RingCT transactions. The reason the protocol behaves this way is in response to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/\"><strong>this research paper</strong></a><strong> </strong>which demonstrates that real inputs can be guessed to be the most recent ones if all the “mixins” are much deeper in the chain and haven’t had transactions for a while.</p><p>For this reason, <strong>it is recommended that all users keep with them an </strong>Anon<strong> balance</strong> which can be automatically put to use by the network (at no fee to the users, of course). Additionally, <strong>it is also recommended that users transact as much as possible with </strong>Anon<strong> transactions</strong> so that it can contribute to enhancing the entire network’s privacy. Note that none of this is required in order to execute a RingCT transaction, but the more people do it, the stronger and more resilient it becomes for everyone.</p><p>This is also one of the main reason why Particl’s Open Marketplace is going to use RingCT transactions, by default, on all marketplace transactions. The best way to increase the RingCT pool is through transactional activity and actual usage of the technology, so making it default on what will become the platform’s main application is only logical and will go a long way into making Particl’s RingCT protocol a very solid one.</p><hr><h2 id=\"stealth-addresses\">Stealth Addresses</h2><p>Additionally, Particl allows anyone to use stealth addresses instead of regular, public addresses. Stealth addresses are one-time addresses that increase privacy because <strong>only the owner of a stealth address can tell if an output belongs to it or not</strong>. What is meant by “one-time address” is that a stealth address can receive payments many times, but each time, it generates a new ‘one-time address’ for that output/transaction.</p><p>Without knowing the private key of an address, an observer won’t be able to link and guess which outputs match which stealth address. <strong>This helps in protecting the identity of the receiver of a transaction.</strong></p><p>On their own, stealth addresses probably aren’t enough to protect transactions information from any well-funded and motivated observer (i.e. state actor), but when combined with stronger privacy protocols such as CT or RingCT, it provides yet another layer of privacy for the user.</p><p><strong>As it currently stands, blinded (CT) and anon (RingCT) transactions can only be executed to stealth addresses.</strong></p><hr><h2 id=\"ct-ringct-together-infinite-possibilities\">CT + RingCT Together = Infinite Possibilities</h2><p>Both privacy protocols have their own pros and cons, but one of the most notable differences between the two Particl implementations is the fact that CT has programmable outputs while RingCT does not. What that means is that RingCT, as is, simply cannot be used within smart-contracts. What that <strong>does not</strong> mean, however, is that it cannot be used within decentralized applications. How is that possible, if RingCT cannot be used in smart-contracts? <strong>This is one of the big reasons why Particl keeps both CT and RingCT protocols on its network instead of just one of them.</strong></p><p>In fact, because CT transactions have programmable outputs, they can be used in smart-contracts and then easily be linked to RingCT transactions. The benefit of Particl’s implementation is that the outputs can be spent from RingCT to CT for anything requiring a script, and then be sent back to RingCT.</p><p>The best example to illustrate this concept is with Particl’s Open Marketplace. It is a <strong>private-by-default marketplace that uses RingCT to completely anonymize marketplace transactions</strong>. What few people know is that the marketplace actually uses a combination of RingCT (the transaction) and CT (the smart-contract) for its escrow system, not RingCT.</p><p>That’s because the marketplace’s escrow system is based on smart-contract functionality, thus requiring transactions to have programmable outputs (hence why it uses CT). However, to interact with the smart-contract, users need to send a RingCT transaction to it, which the marketplace then automatically converts into a CT transaction for the duration of the escrow. Once it gets released by the two transacting parties, the transaction is finalized as a RingCT transaction.</p><blockquote>A RingCT output is converted to a CT output which in turn forms the inputs of the escrow contract. When the escrow is ready to be released or refunded, it will directly be released to a RingCT output.— <a href=\"https://github.com/kewde/\"><strong>Kewde</strong></a><strong>, Particl Developer and </strong><a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/\"><strong>OMP Library</strong></a><strong> Author</strong></blockquote><p>This is just one example of how RingCT can be given its full potential and leverage the Particl and Bitcoin ecosystems using its CT counterpart. The same sort of technique can be applied to integrate RingCT into other protocols or services such as atomic swaps, the Lightning Network, other decentralized applications, and etc.</p><hr><p>If you liked this article, share it wide and beyond and stay tuned as more <em>Particl Explained </em>articles will be posted on <a href=\"http://particl.news\"><strong>particl.news</strong></a> in the future.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained---Private-Transactions/1-wZwosKBtAh5-VPGJZgliQg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p><strong>The Particl team</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

Both of these protocols do not require any trusted setup and have common denominators, but also have different purposes within the Particl platform as well as different levels of privacy.</p><hr><h2 id=\"blinded-transactions-confidential-transactions-ct-\">Blinded Transactions — Confidential Transactions (CT)</h2><p><a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions\"><strong>Confidential Transactions</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions\"><em>Elements - An open source, sidechain-capable blockchain platform.</em>elementsproject.org</a></p><ul><li><em>Privacy level: <strong>Medium (Transacting amounts are hidden)</strong></em></li><li><em>Transaction cost: <strong>Medium (~0.001962 PART)</strong></em></li><li><em>Segwit: <strong>Yes (Reduces CT transactions weight by ~48%)</strong></em></li><li><em>Bulletproofs: <strong>Yes (Reduces range proofs size by ~70%)</strong></em></li><li><em>Trusted setup: <strong>No</strong></em></li><li><em>Programmable outputs: <strong>Yes</strong></em></li><li><em>Whitepaper: </em><a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\"><em><strong>https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation</strong></em></a></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained---Private-Transactions/1-APY4j-vFVOhMr-V0rm30xQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>(Fee: 0.001962 PART)</figcaption></figure><p>Blinded transactions are <strong>currency transactions that have their transacting amounts hidden on the blockchain</strong> and only known by the two transacting parties (the sender and the receiver). This type of transaction uses the <a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\"><strong>Confidential Transactions (CT)</strong></a> privacy protocol which cryptographically guarantees that no more coins can be spent than are available. It uses a zero-knowledge proofing method that <strong>does not require any trusted setup or direct interaction with the party</strong>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained---Private-Transactions/1-q2ZhXl4uqiCXm9IfbIAQuA.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Sending a blinded transaction (CT) on Particl Desktop</figcaption></figure><p>This privacy protocol is entirely trustless, meaning that it doesn’t require any <a href=\"https://minezcash.com/zcash-trusted-setup/\"><strong>trusted setup</strong></a> and doesn’t require the assistance of any intermediary to process transactions. The problem with privacy protocols requiring so-called “<a href=\"https://minezcash.com/zcash-trusted-setup/\"><strong>trusted setups</strong></a>” is that they require a one-time setup that involves the generation and use of <em>master keys</em>. Users then need to put trust in whoever generated those keys to destroy them right after they are done setting up the protocol, otherwise, those keys could be used to create an unlimited amount of coins and do so without anyone noticing it.</p><p>To prove and ensure that amounts being sent and received are positive and the correct ones, Confidential Transactions use what we call a <strong>rangeproof. </strong>In other words, a rangeproof is able to determine that the amount of coins sent in a given transaction is between two values, but it’s not able to tell exactly what that amount is.</p><h3 id=\"rangeproofs\">Rangeproofs</h3><p>A rangeproof is a cryptographic protocol used to<strong> verify that a payment amount is positive or zero, without actually revealing the amount transferred in the transaction</strong>. Without rangeproofs, the amounts in a transaction could be set so large that it would be considered a negative number, thus allowing coins to be generated out of thin air. An attacker could add a negative amount output and another different output, generating extra coins. The negative output would make the commitments still sum to zero.</p><p>The downside with rangeproofs is that they are quite heavy on the blockchain. Their size scales linearly with the number of outputs in a transaction and the bits in the proof’s range. In fact, due to their heavy nature, <strong>rangeproofs take up the majority of a blinded transaction’s size</strong>.</p><p>This inconvenient reality means anyone looking into using the protocol will have to execute bigger transactions than regular, public ones. A bigger transaction not only means higher fees, but it also means that the size of the blockchain grows exponentially along with usage. In other words, it gets more inconvenient to run the blockchain as more and more CT transactions get recorded on it.</p><p>This scalability issue is one of the main reasons why the Particl team has refrained from moving its RingCT implementation onto Particl’s mainnet. Because this project has a long-term vision in mind, it was preferred to wait until a proper solution to this scalability problem was found. And then came Bulletproofs.</p><h3 id=\"bulletproofs\">Bulletproofs</h3><ul><li><em>Whitepaper: </em><a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf\"><em><strong>https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf</strong></em></a></li><li><em>Report from Quarkslab audit into Particl’s implementation of Bulletproofs: </em><a href=\"https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\"><em><strong>https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf</strong></em></a></li></ul><p>Bulletproofs is a new generation of rangeproofs that scale logarithmically rather than linearly.

In simple terms, Bulletproofs is a groundbreaking improvement over regular rangeproofs as <strong>they reduce their size by around ~70%</strong>.

This allows the platform to benefit from the industry-leading privacy protocol that is RingCT but still leverage the security, stability, and developer community of Bitcoin. In other words, RingCT on the Bitcoin codebase is like having your cake and eating it too.

This is due to the addition of ring signatures (MLSAG) into the mix.</p><blockquote><strong>Fun fact: </strong>RingCT was initially implemented on top of the Cryptonote codebase (Monero). The Particl team is the first team to ever develop a custom implementation that could work on any other codebase, in this case, the Bitcoin codebase.</blockquote><h3 id=\"ring-signatures-mlsag-\">Ring Signatures (MLSAG)</h3><ul><li><em>Report from Quarkslab audit into Particl’s implementation of MLSAG: </em><a href=\"https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\"><em><strong>https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf</strong></em></a></li></ul><p><em>Multilayered Linkable Spontaneous Ad-Hoc Group Signatures</em> (MLSAG), or ring signatures, is the <em>Ring</em> part of <em>RingCT</em>. It is a <strong>type of digital signature that is performed by many outputs at once within a given group of RingCT outputs</strong> (represented by <em>Anon</em> balances, on Particl Desktop). It is then <strong>impossible for any observer to tell which of the participating outputs within that signature is the output actually sending out the transaction</strong>.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_signature\">Wikipedia describes ring signatures as follow</a>: “<em>A ring signature is a type of </em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature\"><em>digital signature</em></a><em> that can be performed by any member of a group of users that each have keys. Therefore, a message signed with a ring signature is endorsed by someone in a particular group of people. One of the security properties of a ring signature is that it should be computationally infeasible to determine which of the group members’ keys was used to produce the signature.</em>”.</p><p>In RingCT’s case, the digital signature used to execute a transaction could have originated from any member of the <em>ring group</em>. Users put some of their funds within an Anon balance. Funds held within an Anon balance are used to execute RingCT transactions. Before a transaction is executed, the protocol anonymously signs it by <strong>using other RingCT outputs as</strong> <strong>decoys</strong> and produces a signature that, when verified, looks like it could have been initiated by any of the owners of the RingCT outputs used by the <em>ring group</em>. <strong>It is not possible to know who really made the transaction because it could be anyone that has an output that’s being used by the </strong><em><strong>ring group </strong></em><strong>as a decoy</strong>.</p><p><strong>This effectively anonymizes all values contained within a transaction</strong>— the amount transferred as well as both the transaction’s sender and receiver. It also arms transacting parties with a very strong <strong>plausible deniability</strong> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability\"><strong>1</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption\"><strong>2</strong></a>).</p><h3 id=\"how-to-make-an-anonymous-transaction-ringct-on-particl-desktop\">How to Make an Anonymous Transaction (RingCT) on Particl Desktop</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained---Private-Transactions/1-9xtnttI8YayVWxIaQVlBgw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>A RingCT transaction containing 24 ring members</figcaption></figure><p>On Particl Desktop, it is possible to pick the number of members you want to have within the <em>ring group</em> you’re going to use to anonymize your transactions. On the client, this is referred to as <em>NO. OF RING SIGS</em>.</p><p>What it means is simple, <strong>for every input used to generate your transaction, a number of other outputs will be used to create a digital signature that could have been signed by any of the 24 participants</strong>. In the screenshot just above, the value 24 is selected. This means 23 fake outputs, and 1 real one (the sender of the transaction) will be used to obfuscate the transaction (if it only has 1 input). If the transaction uses 3 inputs, it means 3 signatures, one for each input, with 3 different <em>ring groups </em>of 24 participants each,<em> </em>will be generated in order to execute the transactions. This may sound complicated, but don’t worry, Particl Desktop does everything for you and makes RingCT transactions as easy to send as any other type of transaction.</p><p><strong>To make a RingCT transaction</strong>, simply go into your Send/Convert tab, choose the Anontransaction type, click the Advanced Options, and use the PRIVACY LEVEL (NO. OF RING SIGS) slider that appears at the bottom left corner of the page. The value you pick will be equal to the number of <em>ring members</em> that will be part of your <em>ring group</em>. In reality, you can just leave the slider untouched and use the default level of privacy (8 <em>ring members</em>). This represents a good balance between privacy and cost.</p><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>The more inputs are consumed to execute a RingCT transaction, the more expensive it gets, but also the more private it is. Also, the more ring members (RING SIGS) is selected before executing a transaction, the more expensive it gets, but also the more private it is. If you don’t care about the cost of a transaction and just want maximum privacy, form transactions with as many ring members as possible and with as many inputs as possible.</blockquote><h3 id=\"keeping-a-good-level-of-privacy\">Keeping a Good Level of Privacy</h3><p>As a general rule of thumb and in theory, <strong>RingCT gets more private as more people convert their public balances into </strong>Anon<strong> balances</strong>, thus creating more <em>Anon</em> outputs to be used by <em>ring groups</em> for RingCT transactions. That’s because RingCT relies on other people’s outputs to plausibly deny which output actually signed a transaction, and <strong>the more RingCT outputs there are to sign transactions, the stronger the privacy and plausible deniability aspect of RingCT gets</strong>.</p><p>But, while outputs are randomly picked from any Anon outputs in the chain, they’re most often picked from the most recent RingCT transactions. The reason the protocol behaves this way is in response to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/\"><strong>this research paper</strong></a><strong> </strong>which demonstrates that real inputs can be guessed to be the most recent ones if all the “mixins” are much deeper in the chain and haven’t had transactions for a while.</p><p>For this reason, <strong>it is recommended that all users keep with them an </strong>Anon<strong> balance</strong> which can be automatically put to use by the network (at no fee to the users, of course). Additionally, <strong>it is also recommended that users transact as much as possible with </strong>Anon<strong> transactions</strong> so that it can contribute to enhancing the entire network’s privacy. Note that none of this is required in order to execute a RingCT transaction, but the more people do it, the stronger and more resilient it becomes for everyone.</p><p>This is also one of the main reason why Particl’s Open Marketplace is going to use RingCT transactions, by default, on all marketplace transactions. The best way to increase the RingCT pool is through transactional activity and actual usage of the technology, so making it default on what will become the platform’s main application is only logical and will go a long way into making Particl’s RingCT protocol a very solid one.</p><hr><h2 id=\"stealth-addresses\">Stealth Addresses</h2><p>Additionally, Particl allows anyone to use stealth addresses instead of regular, public addresses. Stealth addresses are one-time addresses that increase privacy because <strong>only the owner of a stealth address can tell if an output belongs to it or not</strong>. What is meant by “one-time address” is that a stealth address can receive payments many times, but each time, it generates a new ‘one-time address’ for that output/transaction.</p><p>Without knowing the private key of an address, an observer won’t be able to link and guess which outputs match which stealth address. <strong>This helps in protecting the identity of the receiver of a transaction.</strong></p><p>On their own, stealth addresses probably aren’t enough to protect transactions information from any well-funded and motivated observer (i.e. state actor), but when combined with stronger privacy protocols such as CT or RingCT, it provides yet another layer of privacy for the user.</p><p><strong>As it currently stands, blinded (CT) and anon (RingCT) transactions can only be executed to stealth addresses.</strong></p><hr><h2 id=\"ct-ringct-together-infinite-possibilities\">CT + RingCT Together = Infinite Possibilities</h2><p>Both privacy protocols have their own pros and cons, but one of the most notable differences between the two Particl implementations is the fact that CT has programmable outputs while RingCT does not. What that means is that RingCT, as is, simply cannot be used within smart-contracts. What that <strong>does not</strong> mean, however, is that it cannot be used within decentralized applications. How is that possible, if RingCT cannot be used in smart-contracts? <strong>This is one of the big reasons why Particl keeps both CT and RingCT protocols on its network instead of just one of them.</strong></p><p>In fact, because CT transactions have programmable outputs, they can be used in smart-contracts and then easily be linked to RingCT transactions. The benefit of Particl’s implementation is that the outputs can be spent from RingCT to CT for anything requiring a script, and then be sent back to RingCT.</p><p>The best example to illustrate this concept is with Particl’s Open Marketplace. It is a <strong>private-by-default marketplace that uses RingCT to completely anonymize marketplace transactions</strong>. What few people know is that the marketplace actually uses a combination of RingCT (the transaction) and CT (the smart-contract) for its escrow system, not RingCT.</p><p>That’s because the marketplace’s escrow system is based on smart-contract functionality, thus requiring transactions to have programmable outputs (hence why it uses CT). However, to interact with the smart-contract, users need to send a RingCT transaction to it, which the marketplace then automatically converts into a CT transaction for the duration of the escrow. Once it gets released by the two transacting parties, the transaction is finalized as a RingCT transaction.</p><blockquote>A RingCT output is converted to a CT output which in turn forms the inputs of the escrow contract. When the escrow is ready to be released or refunded, it will directly be released to a RingCT output.— <a href=\"https://github.com/kewde/\"><strong>Kewde</strong></a><strong>, Particl Developer and </strong><a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/\"><strong>OMP Library</strong></a><strong> Author</strong></blockquote><p>This is just one example of how RingCT can be given its full potential and leverage the Particl and Bitcoin ecosystems using its CT counterpart. The same sort of technique can be applied to integrate RingCT into other protocols or services such as atomic swaps, the Lightning Network, other decentralized applications, and etc.</p><hr><p>If you liked this article, share it wide and beyond and stay tuned as more <em>Particl Explained </em>articles will be posted on <a href=\"http://particl.news\"><strong>particl.news</strong></a> in the future.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained---Private-Transactions/1-wZwosKBtAh5-VPGJZgliQg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p><strong>The Particl team</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est. July, 2025\n * Implementation: Upon successful vote (75% approval rate with minimum quorum\n   of 20% of the total supply over 10,080 blocks) and subsequent hard fork.\n\nImpact\nIf approved, this change will:\n\n * Significantly reduce PART's inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%;\n * Reduce PART’s inflation rate by 0.5% every year until it reaches 1.0%;\n * Remove the network treasury;\n * Initiate a hard fork of the Particl blockchain.\n\nWe believe this proposal represents a positive step toward optimizing the\nParticl network's economic model while ensuring sustainable project development\nand incentivising our community to actively promote and grow the\nnetwork.Important: For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are\nrunning its latest version.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come.
