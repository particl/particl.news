liquidity-providing\nscript for BasicSwap DEX. This user-friendly script enables you to offer\nliquidity for your preferred trading pairs and set a markup above or below the\nmarket price that lets you benefit from arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFurthermore, the script is designed to automatically republish your offers when\nthey expire, adhering to your predefined pricing strategy. This ensures that\nyour offers consistently reflect the current market rate, plus any additional\npremium you have chosen to apply.\n\n> Note: While this is currently made available as a companion script, we\nanticipate that many of its features will eventually be integrated into\nBasicSwap's core functionality.\nHow to Get Started\nTo get started, simply update your BasicSwap DEX instance. The script is\nincluded in the basicswap/scripts folder.\n\n * How to update BasicSwap DEX (Academy): \n   https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html\n * How to update BasicSwap DEX (Youtube): https://youtu.be/kk3FtE_TKBQ\n\nTo run the script, you’ll need to first edit the JSON template configuration\nfile (template_createoffers.json) included with the update to your liking, then\nrename it to createoffers.json. You can find the instructions on how to properly\nedit that file, as well as all possible variables, here\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_liquidity_bot.html] \non the Particl Academy.\n\nBasicSwap DEX Liquidity Tools Guide — Particl Academy latest documentationLearn\nhow to use the liquidity tools available for the BasicSwap DEX\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_liquidity_bot.html]\nOnce that’s done, simply run the script with the command python createoffers.py. \n\n> Note: The script needs to run continuously to be take effect. Closing the\nterminal tab that runs it will terminate it. \n\nFor this reason, we recommend executing the script using Byobu\n[https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-byobu-for-terminal-management-on-ubuntu-16-04] \nor Screen [https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen].\nConsiderations and Recommendations\n * For the script to correctly republish orders and update prices, it must keep\n   on running. Starting to script and then closing the terminal tab will shut it\n   down. As such, we recommend running it with a background task processor, such\n   as Byobu\n   [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-byobu-for-terminal-management-on-ubuntu-16-04] \n   or Screen [https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen] for example.\n * This script is best used in combination with a cloud-based version of\n   BasicSwap. When combined with a VPS setup, you can then ensure that both your\n   BasicSwap node and your script keep running 24/7, offering a true hands-off\n   approach to liquidity provision. Follow this link\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhRe0WuYgZs&list=PLtbTcMbZZKfxAswJnqlh_KbHvWCUFqFVF&index=10] \n   for a complete video tutorial on how to setup BasicSwap DEX on a cloud.\n * Be mindful that, once a swap completes, your offers are not taken off of the\n   order book. As such, it might not be ideal to set your offers as\n   “auto-accept” if you only intend on making one swap. We have a couple of\n   solutions to give the options to limit the number of swaps per order which\n   will come at a later stage, but for now, it’s important to be aware of this\n   behaviour.\n * Be careful about your configuration file’s formatting. JSON requires you to\n   keep the exact same indentations and logic, so watch out when editing the\n   file.\n * The script defaults to using adaptor signatures, which will cause issues if\n   you’re using a non-Segwit coin on the offering side (i.e., Firo, PIVX). In\n   those cases, make sure to configure the pair to use secret hash swaps by\n   putting \"swap_type\": \"secret_hash\" in the configuration file.\n * If you use the production (isolated) docker setup, you can bundle the script\n   with your BasicSwap launch sequence by adding it to your docker-compose\n   configuration file (\n   https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/docker/production/compose-fragments/8_script.yml\n   ).\n\nBecome a Liquidity Provider!\nLiquidity is fundamental to order book based exchanges, which is why we need\nyour assistance.

that has been made in\nthe past few days. Let us take a moment to evaluate the advancements achieved in\nthe past few days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nEarlier in the week, we pushed the new version of Particl Core to Particl\nDesktop, meaning that your client will now automatically download the most\nrecent version the next time you launch it.\n\nIf your Particl Desktop is currently running, you can trigger the update by\nshutting it down and launching it again.\n\nOther than that, we're still completing the items outlined in our previous\nupdates, namely including enhancing Tor server capabilities and making a variety\nof minor improvements.\n\nPlease note, however, that we are currently observing a delay in the development\nprocess of Particl Desktop which we hope to resolve shortly.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nCommits · tecnovert/basicswapBasic Atomic Swap Proof of Concept. Contribute to\ntecnovert/basicswap development by creating an account on GitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commits/master]Early in the week, we\nidentified a rare scenario where a malicious user could manipulate the protocol\nto abandon swaps mid-process. While this situation doesn't pose a risk of loss\nof funds, it could adversely affect user experience by leading participants into\nswaps destined to fail. We have promptly fixed this issue.\n\nYou can find the fix, as well as other updates to the BasicSwap protocol,\ndirectly on its Github page here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commits/master].\n\nUser Interface ?️\nWe've made several improvements and tweaks to the user interface, thanks to\nvaluable community feedback, which are ready to go live any day from now. While\nthe merge still hasn't happened, you can expect GUI v2.0.2 to be deployed\nsomewhere next week.\n\nHere are a few notable improvements featured in v2.0.2:\n\n * Enhanced display and usage of swap rates.\n * Tooltips when hovering over specific areas.\n * Enhanced bid-related pages, including the addition of a button to open swap\n   details as opposed to clicking on the bid's hash, improved display of bid and\n   swap statuses, and more.\n * Persistent filters in the order book and bid/offer pages.\n * Improved information display in the \"Create New Offer\" page.\n\nThese updates aim to create a more intuitive and user-friendly interface. Stay\ntuned for the launch!\n\nCoin Integrations ?\nWe are currently exploring the possibility of introducing new coins to BasicSwap\nin the near future. This initiative is a follow-up to some of our discussions at\nMonerotopia, where we connected with several teams and individuals about\nintegrating their coin or protocol into BasicSwap.\n\nHowever, as each coin integration requires individual attention and can be\ntime-consuming and resource-intensive for all parties involved, we cannot\nprovide specific timelines or commitments at this stage.\n\nAs always, we will take care of informing you as soon as new coins are ready for\ndeployment.\n\nWeb Framework ?\nWe are currently developing a web framework intended to make BasicSwap\naccessible via the web. This is a complex task, as the DEX must be largely\nre-imagined and rebuilt to offer a fitting web experience.\n\nThe deployment of such a platform presents various challenges, both technical\nand user-experience related, that makes it architecturally more intricate, but\nalso more accessible to the end-user, than a local installation.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example, the first iteration of a web version of the\nDEX is designed to be more of a quick exchange platform, similar to the\nExodus/SimpleSwap flow type. Our goal is to avoid requiring users to deposit any\ncoins into a persistent web wallet, enhancing both security and usability.\nHowever, due to the nature of atomic swaps, this approach necessitates that swap\ncontracts be pre-signed and that users send coins directly into these contracts.\nThis represents a completely different approach and a more complex flow compared\nto BasicSwap's current local architecture, but it also opens the door to\nfeatures not readily available on a local installation.\n\nFor this reason, we anticipate that the local and web versions of BasicSwap will\ndiverge significantly, each presenting unique advantages, trade-offs, and\nspecific feature sets. This expanded choice aligns with Particl's mission by\nenhancing user flexibility, enabling them to select the platform that most\nclosely aligns with their needs without forcing compromises on the BasicSwap DEX\nprotocol itself. It's the best of both worlds!\n\nTaking all of that into consideration, developing this web framework will take\nconsiderable time, owing to both its development requirements and the need for\nrigourous testing before deployment. \n\nAt the moment, Particl developers Kewde and Tecnovert are working on this task.\nUpdates on its progress may not be regular, but it is now a major focus moving\nforward, so we will ensure you are informed when significant milestones are\nachieved. Your patience and support in this initiative are greatly appreciated;\nwe are convinced that this is a major part of what needs to happen for BasicSwap\nto take off as an end-user product.\n\nUpcoming Overhaul of Particl.io ?\nAs noted in some of our previous progress updates, we're also working on a new\nversion of the Particl.io website. \n\nWhile we continue to focus on various aspects of the project at the same time,\nwe're still making consistent progress towards getting the new website ready for\nlaunch. \n\nWe expect the revamped website to be ready for deployment relatively soon,\nalthough it is still a bit too early to commit to more precise timelines. So\nstay tuned for further updates on that front!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

Our goal is to avoid requiring users to deposit any coins into a persistent web wallet, enhancing both security and usability. However, due to the nature of atomic swaps, this approach necessitates that swap contracts be pre-signed and that users send coins directly into these contracts. This represents a completely different approach and a more complex flow compared to BasicSwap's current local architecture, but it also opens the door to features not readily available on a local installation.</p><p>For this reason, we anticipate that the local and web versions of BasicSwap will diverge significantly, each presenting unique advantages, trade-offs, and specific feature sets.

However, due to the nature of atomic swaps, this approach necessitates that swap contracts be pre-signed and that users send coins directly into these contracts.

to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
