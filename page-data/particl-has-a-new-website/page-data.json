Built and\ndesigned from the ground up by the team, it’s a massive improvement over the\nprevious website.

A world of\nopportunities awaits you!Particl.io - Apps that respect your rights\n[https://particl.io/]Why a New Website?\nParticl is a mission-driven project with strong convictions. It is supported by\nincredibly talented developers who’ve built a unique and innovative\ndecentralized platform that finally shifts the balance of power back into the\nhands of the people, not greedy corporations. The implications of that are huge\nand it has the potential to change a lot of aspects of our lives.\n\nBut somehow, the now-previous website didn’t fully do full justice to the\nproject's mission and intentions. Although it detailed the project’s unique\ntechnical points (and they sure are impressive), it was easy for new, curious\npeople to miss the bigger picture that ties everything together. That made it\nmore challenging to turn these interested people into new users and fans of the\nproject and limited the impact of any marketing, PR, or outreach effort.\n\nThat's why Particl needed a new website, especially now with the release of\nParticl V3 which pushes the project into a new phase where outreach will be more\nprevalent.\n\nThe Objectives Behind it\nThe website has been built with two simple but clear objectives in mind.\n\n- Showcase Particl’s products and their benefits\n\n- Tell Particl’s story and its mission.\n\nBuilding the website according to these two objectives ensures that the big\npicture becomes apparent and that people understand the purpose of the project,\nwhat it's working to achieve, and what they can get from it.\n\nAfter all, the official website is where new people land when they want to learn\nmore about a project. It’s what they use to make their first impression and\ndecide whether they want to dig deeper or skip the project out of a lack of\ninterest. And with so many projects to look at nowadays and the sheer number of\ndistractions screaming for attention, you have to transmit your message as\nclearly and concisely as possible if you want people to stick around and be\ninterested in digging deeper.\n\nA Website in Expansion\nParticl’s new website is expected to continue expanding and evolving as we move\nforward in time, especially as the upcoming Particl DEX (BasicSwap) soon enters\nits open beta phase. You can track its progress by following the Particl.io\nrepository [https://github.com/particl/particl.io] on Github.\n\nThe Cornerstone of All Upcoming Marketing Efforts\nThe website is where most marketing, PR, and outreach campaigns redirect people\nto. It has to be able to convert curious or interested people into new users of\nfans of the project. After all, that's where these people will be forming their\nfirst impression on the project.\n\nFor this reason, it’s easy to understand why the website is the cornerstone of\nmarketing. It is the key to capitalizing on successful initiatives and turning\npotentially interested people into real users and supporters.\n\nTo that effect, we've published, last week, the team's vision and short to\nmid-term plans for marketing here on Particl News.

Это означает, что платформа Particl управляется только\nсообществом пользователей, из которых она состоит. Сеть коллективно управляется\nвсеми ее пользователями, и никакие частные лица либо организации не имеют\nкакого-либо определённого контроля над ней.\n\nПанель управления торговой площадкой Торговая площадка Particl Marketplace - это\nпервое децентрализованное приложение, построенное на платформе Particl.

На самом деле, а каким образом вы могли бы запретить кому-то покупать\nили продавать что угодно, если нет правил и нет никакой центральной власти с\nособыми полномочиями модерировать контент?  Предоставление определенным\nпользователям особых разрешений/полномочий  удалять контент и поддерживать\nпорядок методом силы и власти- это довольно таки скользкий путь. Постепенно,\nчерез  некоторое время это, скорее всего, в  конечном итоге привело бы к\nвозврату к старым централизованным методам работы, как если бы некая\nцентрализованная компания запустила свою платформу, ввела там свои правила и\nвзимала плату. Но  для Particl такой путь был бы неприемлем. Particl - это\nдецентрализация власти, свобода и конфиденциальность. Многочисленные случаи\nутечки данных и злоупотреблений ими в последние годы,  например постоянные\nскандалы вокруг Facebook, однозначно показали что технологической индустрии\nнеобходимо эволюционировать в направлении защиты своих пользователей.\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f/]\nКроме того,  поскольку данные стали достаточно ценным, и соответственно -лакомой\nдобычей для хакеров, то мы не можем всерьез расчитывать или доверять\n централизованным моделям хранения данных в вопросах эффективной безопасности и\nзащиты наших данных.\n\n Вот почему тоговая площадка Particl  полностью децентрализована и построена в\nсоответствии с принципами «конфиденциальности на уровне замысла\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_by_design]». Она создана именно так чтобы\nвам просто не нужно было никому доверять для того, чтобы самому вести себя\nчестно. Такой подход гарантирует что никто не получит какие-либо ваши данные\n кроме вашего партнера, с которым вы совершаете сделку. Проще говоря, это\nследующий логичный шаг эволюции в технологии электронной коммерции для защиты\nконфиденциальности своих пользователей. Но, как и любая другая революционная\nтехнология, она также открывает и новые вопросы, требующие решения. Одна из\nтаких задач- как очистить некоторый нишевый рынок  от нежелательных для\nсообщества товаров.\n\nДецентрализованное управление\n Для борьбы с нежелательным контентом Particl Marketplace использует полностью\nдецентрализованный и прозрачно справедливый механизм управления - каждый может\nпроголосовать против нежелательных товаров.\n\nКак отметить нежелательные товары / видеоКоротко:\n * Соотношение силы голоса: 1 монета PART = 1 голос\n * Порог для удаления, на момент публикации: -9,000 PART (может изменяться)\n * Ваши монеты не блокируются для голосования\n * Комиссия за пометку товара: менее 0.001 PART для первого, кто пометил\n   товар(как нежелательный) и бесплатно для всех последующих.\n\nПорог для удаления\n Чтобы проголосовать против определенного товара, пользователи должны пометить\nего, используя специальную кнопку \"Flag\"  интерфейса Particl Marketplace. После\nтого, как кто-то в первый раз помечает товар как нежелательный  - он помещается\nв очередь всех ранее помеченных товаров. Затем другие пользователи могут либо\nсогласиться с тем, что его следует удалить с торговой площадки, либо не\nсогласиться и проголосовать за то, чтобы он остался. Чтобы товар был полностью\nудален, сумма голосов негативных голосов должна достичь определенного\nотрицательного порога (на данный момент это -9000 голосов).Такая\nдецентрализованная система модерации на Particl Marketplace похожа, например, на\nсистему голосования Reddit за/против(upvote/downvote). На Reddit это работает\nтак: если, например, 5 пользователей проголосуют против публикации и 3\nпользователя проголосуют за нее, то у публикации будет итоговая оценка -2. Если\nже она достигнет определенного отрицательного порога (например, -10), то пост\n автоматически скрывается от других пользователей. Reddit считает голоса по\nпринципу: 1 пользователь = 1 голос.\n\nКак проголосовать за удаление товара\nСистема модерации публикаций на Particl Marketplace идентична этому. Каждый\nпользователь, голосуя за или против помеченного товара, вносит свой вклад в\nувеличение или уменьшение итоговой оценки этого товара. Причем, голосование\nпротив товара также скрывает его в личной копии клиентского ПО проголосовавшего\nпользователя (скрывается только у него, но а не скрывается для всех пока оценка\nне достигнет порога удаления).      Из-за своей конфиденциальности по замыслу и\nдецентрализованного характера Particl Marketplace не имеет  реального способа\nобнаружить пользователей с мульти-аккаунтами, заблокировать учетную запись, либо\nзаблокировать  IP-адрес, или вручную отфильтровать голоса, чтобы удалить\nфальшивые таким образом, и т.д. То есть, если бы система голосования\n основывалась на таких параметрах, то она была бы стать легко фальсифицируемой.\nПоэтому вместо всего этого Particl считает голоса как 1 монета = 1 голосу, что\nделает невозможными все подобные игры с системой. Не имеет значения сколько\nкошельков вы используете или сколько раз вы пытаетесь менять свой IP-адрес - при\nподсчете голосов система учитывает только ваш «вес монет». Это гарантирует, что\nвлиять на результаты голосования могут  только те, кто имеет реальную долю монет\nв сети. Порог удаления для открытой торговой площадки Particl будет -9000 на\nвремя первой версии основной сети. В дальнейшем, по мере развития платформы,\nэтот порог может и будет корректироваться, и для определения оптимального\nзначения может потребоваться несколько таких коррекций.  Потому что теорию игры \nневозможно было полноценно проверить в тестовой сети (т.к. тестовые монеты не\nимеют никакой ценности),  это можно будет сделать только  в реальных условиях\nработы.\n\nТеория игры\n Как вы наверное уже поняли, этот механизм на самом деле предельно прост, но при\nэтом он достаточно мощный и эффективный. Так как в его основу положен один\nаспект теории игр в целом: пользователю необходимо приобрести много монет чтобы\nиметь значительную силу голоса и таким образом существенно влиять на исход\nголосования. Это может быть довольно дорогим удовольствием в зависимости от\nактивного порогового значения для удаления (в первой версии торговой площадки\nдля основной сети этот порог будет -9000), и дальше это будет только дорожать по\nмере получения платформой большего сетевого эффекта. Например, представьте что\nплохой парень с 9999 PART попытается удалить(не объективно, а  по личным\nсоображениям, и т.п.) какой-то товар. Но затем один хороший парень с 1000 PART\nсможет предотвратить это удаление. Плохому парню с 19999 PART могут\nпротивостоять 11 хороших парней с 1000 PART каждый, и так далее.        \nГолосующие сильно мотивированы вести себя корректно, так как они имеют прямую\nфинансовую долю в сети.  Если голосующие, например,  вступят в сговор друг с\nдругом и начнут троллить либо подвергать необъективной цензуре торговую\nплощадку, то это, скорее всего, снизит стоимость сети в целом и, таким образом,\nэто принесет лишь чистые убытки всем заговорщикам.    Если пользователи торговой\nплощадки не будут активно помогать в управлении сообществом, то это может\nпривести к заполнению площадки нежелательным либо спамерским контентом. Такое\nбудет отталкивать людей и может серьезно снизить потенциальный сетевой эффект,\nсоздав серьезное препятствие для привлечения более широкой аудитории к\nиспользованю Particl Marketplace.                                              \n             Фактически все пользователи Particl Marketplace имеют финансовую\nдолю в сети, поэтому любые действия, отталкивающие пользователей от Particl\nMarketplace, работают  против их собственных интересов. Большее количество\n пользователей на торговой площадке означает больше потенциальных покупателей\nдля продавцов и больше товаров  для покупателей. Поэтому участие в  управлению\nсообществом - это небольшой, но очень важный вклад, который каждый пользователь\nможет сделать для  Particl . \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nВопросы - ответы\n * Какой порог для удаления?\n * Порог для удаления в настоящее время по умолчанию составляет -9000, для\n   первой версии Particl Marketplace в основной сети. Этот порог можно настроить\n   для своей локальной копии приложения. Если, например, вы установите у себя\n   порог  -19000, то товары будут удалятся у вас только когда они дойдут до\n   -19000 голосов.\n\n--\n\n * Исчезнет ли товар после того как я проголосую против?\n * Товар удаляется из вашего личного экземпляра приложения торговой площадки как\n   только он достигает порога удаления, настроенного вами (-9000 по умолчанию).\n   Товар удалится отовсюду только после того, как он достигает порога удаления,\n   индивидуально настроенного в каждой копии приложения (-9000 по умолчанию).\n\n--\n\n * Нужен ли мне стейкинг чтобы голосовать?\n * Нет, не нужно помещать монеты в стейкинг. Голосовать может любой, имеющий\n   монеты на балансе.\n\n--\n\n * Могу ли я головать если мои монеты хранятся на аппаратном кошельке?\n * В настоящее время нет, но поддержка аппаратных кошельков планируется в\n   будущем.\n\n--\n\n * Есть ли комиссия за пометку товара?\n * Если вы первый пользователь, помечающий объявление, которое ещё не было\n   помечено ранее, то с вас будет взиматься символическая плата (0.00x PART или\n   менее). Если вы помечаете товар, который уже был кем-то помечен ранее -\n   комиссия не взимается.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl - это участие\nМы хотим быть узнаваемыми везде, и с вашей помощью мы станем более заметными.\nДля вас это занимает секунды - подписаться на наши каналы и нажать на иконку\nколокольчика.\n\nYouTube [https://youtube.com/c/particl] Twitter\n[https://twitter.com/Particl_RU/] Mastodon [https://fosstodon.org/@particl] \nReddit [https://reddit.com/r/particl]\n\n\nПрисоединяйтесь к нашим чатам для живого общения.

После того, как кто-то в первый раз помечает товар как нежелательный  - он помещается в очередь всех ранее помеченных товаров. Затем другие пользователи могут либо согласиться с тем, что его следует удалить с торговой площадки, либо не согласиться и проголосовать за то, чтобы он остался. Чтобы товар был полностью удален, сумма голосов негативных голосов должна достичь определенного отрицательного порога (на данный момент это -9000 голосов).Такая децентрализованная система модерации на Particl Marketplace похожа, например, на систему голосования Reddit за/против(upvote/downvote). На Reddit это работает так: если, например, 5 пользователей проголосуют против публикации и 3 пользователя проголосуют за нее, то у публикации будет итоговая оценка -2. Если же она достигнет определенного отрицательного порога (например, -10), то пост  автоматически скрывается от других пользователей. <strong>Reddit считает голоса по принципу: 1 пользователь = 1 голос.</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/2880/1*4oviqSSL0DeUDYK6vFHdhg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Как проголосовать за удаление товара</figcaption></figure><p><br> Система модерации публикаций на Particl Marketplace идентична этому. Каждый пользователь, голосуя за или против помеченного товара, вносит свой вклад в увеличение или уменьшение итоговой оценки этого товара. Причем, голосование против товара также скрывает его в личной копии клиентского ПО проголосовавшего пользователя (скрывается только у него, но а не скрывается для всех пока оценка не достигнет порога удаления).      Из-за своей конфиденциальности по замыслу и децентрализованного характера Particl Marketplace не имеет  реального способа обнаружить пользователей с мульти-аккаунтами, заблокировать учетную запись, либо заблокировать  IP-адрес, или вручную отфильтровать голоса, чтобы удалить фальшивые таким образом, и т.д. То есть, если бы система голосования  основывалась на таких параметрах, то она была бы стать легко фальсифицируемой. Поэтому вместо всего этого <strong>Particl считает голоса как 1 монета = 1 голосу</strong>, что делает невозможными все подобные игры с системой. Не имеет значения сколько кошельков вы используете или сколько раз вы пытаетесь менять свой IP-адрес - при подсчете голосов система учитывает только ваш «вес монет». Это гарантирует, что влиять на результаты голосования могут  только те, кто имеет реальную долю монет в сети.<strong> Порог удаления для открытой торговой площадки Particl будет -9000</strong> на время первой версии основной сети. В дальнейшем, по мере развития платформы, этот порог может и будет корректироваться, и для определения оптимального значения может потребоваться несколько таких коррекций.  Потому что <strong>теорию игры</strong> невозможно было полноценно проверить в тестовой сети (т.к. тестовые монеты не имеют никакой ценности),  это можно будет сделать только  в реальных условиях работы.</p><h3 id=\"--4\">Теория игры</h3><p> Как вы наверное уже поняли, этот механизм на самом деле предельно прост, но при этом он достаточно мощный и эффективный. Так как в его основу положен один аспект <strong>теории игр</strong> в целом: пользователю необходимо приобрести много монет чтобы иметь значительную силу голоса и таким образом существенно влиять на исход голосования. Это может быть довольно дорогим удовольствием в зависимости от активного порогового значения для удаления (в первой версии торговой площадки для основной сети этот <strong>порог будет -9000</strong>), и дальше это будет только дорожать по мере получения платформой большего сетевого эффекта. Например, представьте что плохой парень с 9999 PART попытается удалить(не объективно, а  по личным соображениям, и т.п.) какой-то товар. Но затем один хороший парень с 1000 PART сможет предотвратить это удаление. Плохому парню с 19999 PART могут противостоять 11 хороших парней с 1000 PART каждый, и так далее.         Голосующие сильно мотивированы вести себя корректно, так как они имеют прямую финансовую долю в сети.  Если голосующие, например,  вступят в сговор друг с другом и начнут троллить либо подвергать необъективной цензуре торговую площадку, то это, скорее всего, снизит стоимость сети в целом и, таким образом, это принесет лишь чистые убытки всем заговорщикам.    Если пользователи торговой площадки не будут активно помогать в управлении сообществом, то это может привести к заполнению площадки нежелательным либо спамерским контентом. Такое будет отталкивать людей и может серьезно снизить потенциальный сетевой эффект, создав серьезное препятствие для привлечения более широкой аудитории к использованю Particl Marketplace.                                                            Фактически все пользователи Particl Marketplace имеют финансовую долю в сети, поэтому любые действия, отталкивающие пользователей от Particl Marketplace, работают  против их собственных интересов. Большее количество  пользователей на торговой площадке означает больше потенциальных покупателей для продавцов и больше товаров  для покупателей. Поэтому участие в  управлению сообществом - это небольшой, но очень важный вклад, который каждый пользователь может сделать для  Particl . </p><hr><h3 id=\"--5\">Вопросы - ответы</h3><ul><li><strong>Какой порог для удаления?</strong></li><li>Порог для удаления в настоящее время по умолчанию составляет -9000, для первой версии Particl Marketplace в основной сети.

Кроме того, торговая площадка Particl полностью конфиденциальна по умолчанию - это значит что нет привязки каких-либо идентификационных данных к кому-либо из ее пользователей. Финансовые транзакции скрыты в блокчейне, обмен данными зашифрован, все изображения удаляются из метаданных, и т.д., и кроме всего это этого вы также можете подключаться к торговой площадке через сеть Tor. Если сказать проще - <strong>обеспечена  100%-я конфиденциальность пользователей торговой площадки.</strong></p><h3 id=\"-\">Нежелательный контент</h3><p> Однако, всё это также создает некоторую проблему касательно размещаемого контента. На самом деле, а каким образом вы могли бы запретить кому-то покупать или продавать что угодно, если нет правил и нет никакой центральной власти с особыми полномочиями модерировать контент?  Предоставление определенным пользователям особых разрешений/полномочий  удалять контент и поддерживать порядок методом силы и власти- это довольно таки скользкий путь. Постепенно, через  некоторое время это, скорее всего, в  конечном итоге привело бы к возврату к старым централизованным методам работы, как если бы некая централизованная компания запустила свою платформу, ввела там свои правила и взимала плату. Но  для Particl такой путь был бы неприемлем. Particl - это децентрализация власти, свобода и конфиденциальность. Многочисленные случаи утечки данных и злоупотреблений ими в последние годы,  например постоянные скандалы вокруг Facebook, однозначно показали что <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f/\">технологической индустрии необходимо эволюционировать в направлении защиты своих пользователей.</a>  </strong>Кроме того,  поскольку данные стали достаточно ценным, и соответственно -лакомой добычей для хакеров, то мы не можем всерьез расчитывать или доверять  централизованным моделям хранения данных в вопросах эффективной безопасности и защиты наших данных.  </p><p> Вот почему тоговая площадка Particl  полностью децентрализована и построена в соответствии с принципами «<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_by_design\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"><strong>конфиденциальности на уровне замысла</strong></a>». Она создана именно так чтобы вам просто не нужно было никому доверять для того, чтобы самому вести себя честно. Такой подход гарантирует что никто не получит какие-либо ваши данные  кроме вашего партнера, с которым вы совершаете сделку. Проще говоря, это следующий логичный шаг эволюции в технологии электронной коммерции для защиты конфиденциальности своих пользователей.

В этой серии\nстатей будут разъясняться доступным для всех языком различные технические\nаспекты платформы Particl.  Cтатьи дадут вам хорошие базовые знания о\nтехническом функционировании платформы и в дальнейшем послужат путеводителем для\nобъяснения этих функции новому члену сообщества или пользователю платформы.\n\n. . .\n\n Для финансовых транзакций на платформе Particl используется конфиденциальная\nкриптовалюта PART с разными уровнями анонимности.  Пользователи могут выбирать\nмежду 3 типами транзакций (публичными, “слепыми”, анонимными), когда используют\nмонеты PART для платежей .  Каждый из этих типов транзакций обеспечивает\nопределенный уровень конфиденциальности и имеет свой собственный набор свойств.\nВ этой статье мы разберем все эти типы транзакций, расскажем о каждом подробно и\nобъясним для чего и когда вам нужно их использовать. Транзакции на платформе\nParticl перестанут быть чем-то неведомым для вас после прочтения!\n\nСодержание (нажмите для перехода)\n * Публичные транзакции (Public)\n * Blind/“Слепые” транзакции (CT)\n * Протокол Rangeproof\n * Протокол Bulletproof\n * Анонимные транзакции (Anon)\n * Кольцевые подписи (MLSAG)\n * Как создать анонимную транзакцию (RingCT) в приложении Particl\n * Обеспечение требуемого уровня конфиденциальности\n * Скрытые (Stealth) адреса\n * CT + RingCT вместе = бесконечные возможности\n\n\n\nПубличные транзакции\nПротокол: Bitcoin\n\nУровень конфиденциальности: низкий\n\nСтоимость транзакции: низкая (~ 0,000346 PART)Segwit: \n\nДа (снижает вес транзакций на ~20%)\n\nДоверенная установка: Нет\n\nПрограммируемые выходы: Да\n\nПо умолчанию все транзакции отправляются как «публичные транзакции», если вы не\nвыбрали протокол конфиденциальности чтобы скрыть ваши транзакции в блокчейне. И\nпоскольку Particl основан на кодовой базе Биткоин, то они записываются в\nблокчейн точно так же, как обычно записываются все транзакции Биткоин. \n\nПримечание.\n> Ядро Particl всегда своевременно обновляется в соответствии с последними\nверсиями ядра Биткоина. Таким образом, все исправления, улучшения безопасности и\nобновления ядра Биткоина также интегрируются и в ядро Particl.\n\n\n\n\n Биткойн не анонимен несмотря на то, что так утверждают многие. На самом деле\nвсё как раз наоборот. Биткоин-транзакции (а также публичные транзакции Particl)\nдовольно прозрачны, мы это называем псевдонимными транзакциями. Вместо привязки\nк идентификации личности каждая такая транзакция привязывается к псевдонимам\nсостоящих из различных чисел и символов, просто называемых адресами.    \nВозможно этого достаточно для защиты ваших данных от незаинтересованных сторон.\nОднако, появление надежных инструментов анализа блокчейна позволяет любой\nлюбопытной, либо мотивированной стороне начать копаться в блокчейне и\nотслеживать пользователей. Стало значительно проще связать такие\nадреса-псевдонимы с вашими идентификационными данными на бирже, в платежной\nсистеме, у продавца и т. п., когда вы совершаете платеж любому из них.По этой\nпричине команда Particl реализовала два дополнительных протокола для\nконфиденциальности, которые скрывают транзакции в блокчейне. Оба этих протокола\nне требуют каких-либо доверенных установок и решают одну и ту же общую задачу,\nно имеют разные цели на платформе Particl и разные уровни конфиденциальности.\n\nBlind/“слепые” транзакции\nПротокол: Confidential Transactions(СТ)\n\nУровень конфиденциальности: средний (суммы транзакций скрыты)\n\nСтоимость транзакции: средняя (~ 0,001962 PART)\n\nSegwit: Да (снижает вес транзакций CT на ~ 48%)\n\nBulletproofs: Да (уменьшает размер доказательств на ~ 70%)\n\nДоверенная установка: Нет\n\nПрограммируемые «выходы»: Да\n\nТехническая документация: \nhttps://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\n\n Blind/“слепыми” транзакциями называются те, суммы которых скрыты в блокчейне и\nизвестны только двум участникам сделки - отправителю и получателю. Этот тип\nтранзакции использует протокол конфиденциальности Confidential Transactions\n(CT).\n\n Данный протокол конфиденциальности не требует никакихдоверенных установок, и\nтакже  не требует помощи какого-либо посредника для обработки транзакций либо\nпрямого взаимодействия между сторонами транзакции. \n\nПримечание.\n> «доверенные установки» требуют одноразовой установки, которая включает создание\nи использование мастер-ключей. Таким образом, пользователям необходимо иметь\nопределенный кредит доверия к сгенерировавшему эти ключи, в том, что он\nуничтожит их сразу после завершения настройки протокола. В противном случае эти\nключи могут быть использованы для создания неограниченного количества монет и\nникто не смог бы этого заметить.\n\n\n\n\n Blind/“слепые” транзакции используют метод проверки с нулевым разглашением,\nчтобы криптографически гарантировать, что нельзя потратить больше монет чем\nдоступно. В частности, они используют метод, который называется\nкриптографическим доказательством диапазона (Rangeproof), который гарантирует,\nчто количество монет, отправленных в данной транзакции, находится между двумя\nзначениями.\n\nRangeproof\nRangeproof (криптографическое доказательство принадлежности к диапазону) - это\nкриптографический протокол, используемый для проверки того, что сумма платежа\nположительна либо равна нулю, но без фактического раскрытия самой суммы\nтранзакции. Без этих доказательств диапазона было бы возможно установить сумму\nтранзакции настолько большой, что это привело бы к отрицательным значениям, и\nтаким образом, позволило бы генерировать монеты из воздуха. Злоумышленник мог бы\nдобавлять потраченные или другие «выходы», генерируя дополнительные монеты.\nОтрицательный результат приведет к тому, что сумма отправки все равно будет\nравна нулю.    Обратной стороной доказательств диапазона является то, что они\nдовольно сильно утяжеляют блокчейн. Их размер зависит линейно от количества\nвыходов транзакции и битов в диапазоне доказательства. Из-за такой вот “тяжелой”\nприроды эти доказательства диапазона занимают большую часть общего размера\n Blind/“слепой” транзакции.   Эта неудобная реальность приводит к тому, что при\nиспользовании этого протокола транзакции имеют больший размер, чем обычные\nпубличные. Транзакция большего размера, кроме более высоких комиссий,  также\nприводит к тому, что и размер блокчейна экспоненциально растет по мере\nиспользования.  Таким образом, работа с более громоздким блокчейном становится\nвсе более и более неудобной по мере того, как в нем будет записано все больше и\nбольше транзакций CT.\n\nПримечание.\n> Эта проблема масштабируемости - одна из основных причин, по которым команда\nParticl задержала перенос своей реализации RingCT в основную сеть. Было решено\nподождать, пока будет найдено правильное решение этой проблемы масштабируемости,\nи тогда появились Bulletproofs.\n\n\n\n\nBulletproof\nТехническая документация: https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf\n\nОтчет по аудиту Quarkslab о реализации Bulletproofs в Particl: \nhttps://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\n\nBulletproofs - это новое поколение криптографических доказательств\nпринадлежности к диапазону, которое взвешивается скорее логарифмически чем\nлинейно. В тех. документации [https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf] они\nупоминаются как не-интерактивные короткие доказательства с нулевым разглашением.\nЕсли сказать проще, то Bulletproofs - это революционное улучшение по сравнению с\nобычными защитами диапазона типа Rangeproofs, поскольку их размер примерно на\n70% меньше. А так как именно защита диапазона составляет большую часть размера\nсамой транзакции CT, то это в той же мере снижает комиссии за транзакции и\nпространство, занимаемое транзакциями в блокчейне.\n\n\nЗабавный факт:\n> термин «Bulletproofs» придумал Shashank Agrawal, когда он описал новый тип\nдоказательства диапазона так: «краткий как пуля, но с пуленепробиваемой\nбезопасностью».\n\n\nАнонимные транзакции  (протокол RingCT)\nПротокол: RingCT\n\nУровень конфиденциальности: высокий (суммы транзакций и участники скрыты)\n\nСтоимость транзакции: от средней до высокой, в зависимости от количества\nпримесей, используемых в кольцевых подписях, или от размера колец.Стоимость\nтранзакции для настроек низкой конфиденциальности: ~ 0,003232 PART Стоимость\nтранзакции для настроек высокой конфиденциальности: ~ 0,009032 PART\n\nSegwit: Да (снижает вес транзакции ~ 47%)\n\nBulletproofs: Да (уменьшает размер rangeproofs на ~ 70%)\n\nДоверенная установка: Нет\n\nПрограммируемые «выходы»: Нет\n\nТехническая документация: https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf\n\n Анонимные транзакции, или как они называются в Particl Desktop - транзакции\nAnon, выводят конфиденциальность на новый уровень, так как скрывают не только\nпереводимые суммы, но также и личности участников транзакции (отправителя и\nполучателя). Для транзакций этого типа используется протокол конфиденциальности\nRingCT, ставший популярным благодаря Monero, но адаптированный командой Particl\nдля работы с кодовой базой Биткоина. Это позволяет платформе получить\nпреимущества ведущего в отрасли протокола конфиденциальности RingCT, но при этом\nтакже использовать безопасность и стабильность от сообщества разработчиков\nБиткоина. Другими словами, RingCT на базе кода Биткоина - это все равно как не\nпросто иметь торт, а таки его и съесть. Хорошее без плохого.\n\n Хорошие примеры вышесказанного заключаются в возможности использования RingCT с\nпомощью специальных скриптов в атомарных свопах, в децентрализованных\nприложениях(таких как Particl Marketplace), в протоколе Lightning Network, и т.\nп. Это также позволяет связать RingCT напрямую с транзакциями CT, что поможет\nдостичь полной программируемости- мы это рассмотрим позже в этой статье.Так же,\nкак и Blind/“слепые” транзакции, использующие протокол CT, анонимные транзакции \nне требуют доверия и не полагаются на какие-либо доверенные установки. Нужно\nотметить, что транзакции RingCT также немного больше чем конфиденциальные\nтранзакции(СТ), но не намного. Это из-за добавления в микс кольцевых подписей\n(MLSAG).\n\n\nИнтересный факт:\n> изначально RingCT был реализован поверх кодовой базы Cryptonote (Monero).\nКоманда Particl была первой, кто когда-либо разработал индивидуальную\nреализацию, которая могла бы работать с любой другой кодовой базой, в данном\nслучае с кодовой базой Биткоин.\n\n\n\nКольцевые подписи (MLSAG)\nОтчет об аудите Quarkslab о реализации MLSAG в Particl: \nhttps://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\n\n Многоуровневые связываемые спонтанные специальные групповые подписи\n(Multilayered Linkable Spontaneous Ad-Hoc Group Signatures - MLSAG), или — так\nназываемые кольцевые подписи, являются ключевой частью RingCT. Это такой тип\nцифровой подписи, которая выполняется одновременно многими «выходами» в рамках\nопределенной группы RingCT выходов (представленных балансами Anon на Particl\nDesktop). В этом случае ни один наблюдатель не может сказать какой именно из\nучаствующих «выходов» в этой подписи фактически подписывает и отправляет\nтранзакцию.\n\n\nВикипедия описывает кольцевые подписи так:\n> «Кольцева́я по́дпись (англ. ring signature) — вариант реализации электронной\nподписи, при котором известно, что сообщение подписано одним из членов списка\nпотенциальных подписантов, но не раскрывается, кем именно. Подписант\nсамостоятельно формирует список из произвольного числа различных лиц, включая в\nнего и себя. Для наложения подписи подписывающему не требуются разрешение,\nсодействие или помощь со стороны включённых в список лиц — используются только\nоткрытые ключи всех членов списка и закрытый ключ лишь самого подписывающего»\n\n\n\nОдним из свойств безопасности кольцевой подписи является то, что путем\nвычислений невозможно определить чей именно ключ из членов группы был\nиспользован для создания подписи. В случае RingCT цифровая подпись,\nиспользованная для выполнения транзакции, могла исходить от любого члена\nкольцевой группы. Пользователи помещают часть своих средств на баланс Anon.\nСредства, находящиеся на балансе Anon, используются для выполнения RingCT\nтранзакций. Протокол анонимно подписывает транзакцию перед ее выполнением, \nиспользуя другие имеющиеся на блокчейне Анон «выходы» в качестве отвлекающих\nприманок, и таким образом создает подпись, которая при проверке выглядит так,\nкак будто бы она могла быть инициирована любым из владельцев выходов RingCT,\nиспользуемых кольцевой группой. В итоге невозможно узнать, кто именно совершил\nэту транзакцию, потому что это мог быть кто угодно из тех, чьи «выходы»\nиспользовались кольцевой группой в качестве приманок.\nЭто эффективно анонимизирует все данные, содержащиеся в транзакции —\nпередаваемую сумму, а также отправителя и получателя транзакции. Это также дает\nучастникам сделки очень веские правдоподобные основания для отрицания (1\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability], 2\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption]).\n\nКак создать анонимную транзакцию (RingCT) в Particl Desktop\n\nВ Particl Desktop можно выбрать количество участников для кольцевой группы, т.е.\nложных подписантов,  которое вы собираетесь использовать для анонимизации своих\nтранзакций. В клиентском приложении этот называется: NO. OF RING SIGS.Это\nозначает простую вещь: для каждого вашего входа, задействованного для генерации\nвашей транзакции, будет использоваться некоторое количество других выходов для\nсоздания цифровой подписи, и это может быть подписано любым из 24 участников\n(например). Значение 24 выбрано на скриншоте чуть выше. Это означает, что для\nмаскировки транзакции будут использованы 23 чужих «выходов» в качестве\nотвлекающих приманок плюс реальный «выход» отправителья транзакции. В случае\nесли транзакция использует больше чем 1 «выход» отправителья, например 3\n«выхода», то это означает, что для выполнения транзакции будут сгенерированы 3\nкольцевых подписей, по одной для каждого  «выхода», с 24 участниками в каждой!\nЭто может показаться слишком сложным, но не волнуйтесь - Particl Desktop сделает\nвсе это за вас, сделает отправку транзакций RingCT такой же легкой, как любой\nдругой транзакции.\nЧтобы создать транзакцию RingCT: просто перейдите на вкладку «Send/Convert»,\nвыберите тип транзакции «Anon», затем кликните «Advanced Options»\n(дополнительные параметры) и двигайте ползунок уровня конфиденциальности (NO. OF\nRING SIGS), который отображается в нижнем левом углу страницы. Выбранное вами\nзначение будет равно количеству участников кольца в вашей кольцевой группе . Но\nвы можете и не трогать ползунок, оставив уровень конфиденциальности по умолчанию\n(24 участников кольца). Это будет хороший баланс между конфиденциальностью и\nстоимостью.\n\n\nПримечание.\n> Чем больше «выходов» и ложных подписантов используется для транзакции RingCT -\nтем дороже она становится, но также - тем более конфиденциальной она получится.\nЕсли вас не волнует стоимость транзакции и вы хотите получить лишь максимальную\nконфиденциальность - создавайте транзакции с максимально возможным количеством\nучастников кольца и с максимально возможным количеством входов.\n\n\n\n\nПоддержание хорошего уровня конфиденциальности\n Как общее правило, в теории и практически, RingCT становится тем более\nконфиденциальным, чем больше людей конвертируют свои публичные балансы в балансы\nAnon, тем самым создавая больше «выходов» Anon, которые будут доступны к\nиспользованию кольцевыми группами для транзакций RingCT. Это потому, что RingCT\nполагается на «выходы» других людей, чтобы правдоподобно отрицать какой из\nвыходов на самом деле подписал транзакцию, и чем больше имеется выходов RingCT\nдля подписи транзакций - тем сильнее становится аспект конфиденциальности и\nправдоподобного отрицания.Но, хотя «выходы» выбираются из любых выходов Anon в\nцепи случайным образом, все же чаще всего они выбираются из самых последних\nтранзакций RingCT. Причина, по которой протокол работает таким образом,\nзаключается в ответе на этот исследовательский документ\n[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/], который демонстрирует, что реальными\nвходами можно считать те, которые самые свежие, а все приманки находятся намного\nглубже в цепи т.е. старые и долгое время не использовались в транзакциях.\nИсходя из этого, рекомендуется чтобы все пользователи держали хотя бы часть\nсредств на балансе Anon т.е. Анон «выходах», которые могут быть автоматически\nиспользованы сетью (разумеется, бесплатно для пользователей) в Анон транзакциях.\nКроме того, рекомендуется чтобы пользователи совершали как можно больше\nтранзакций Anon, и это могло бы способствовать повышению конфиденциальности всей\nсети. Обратите внимание, что не обязательные требования для выполнения\nтранзакции RingCT, но чем больше людей будут это делать, тем сильнее и\nустойчивее сеть становится для всех.\nParticl Marketplace использует по умолчанию именно транзакции RingCT для всех\nтранзакций на торговой площадке. Таким образом, каждый новый пользователь\nторговой площадки будет добавлять новые транзакции anon в блокчейн, используя\nанонимные транзакции для каждой своей покупки или продажи.  Другими словами,\nпользователям платформы Particl не нужно делать ничего особенного кроме этого.\nТак как рост количества анонимных транзакций  и размер анонимного пула прямо\nсвязаны с ростом торговой площадки Particl. По мере роста ее использования\nтранзакции RingCT будут становиться  все более и более запутанными сравнительно\nс  другими блокчейнами, использующими технологию RingCT.\n\nСкрытые адреса\n Скрытые адреса - это специальные адреса, которые можно генерировать как\n«одноразовые адреса приема».  Под «адресом одноразового приема» подразумевается\n что каждый раз, когда отправитель использовал этот адрес для отправки некоторых\nмонет, то создается новый адрес для следующей отправки/получения. На самом деле,\nна скрытый адрес можно получать платежи несколько раз, но все эти платежи будут\nпопадать на разные «выходы», принадлежащие владельцу скрытого адреса. Это\nувеличивают конфиденциальность, потому что только владелец скрытого адреса может\nопределить, принадлежит ли выход ему или нет. Не зная приватного ключа адреса,\nнаблюдатель не сможет связать и угадать, какие  «выходы» и с каким скрытым\nадресом связаны даже если знает скрытые адреса. Это помогает в защите получателя\nтранзакции от идентификации.\nОдних лишь скрытых адресов не достаточно для защиты информации о транзакциях от\nхорошо финансируемого и мотивированного наблюдателя (например, государственного\nучреждения), но в комбинации с более сильными протоколами конфиденциальности,\nтакими как CT или RingCT, они обеспечивают еще один уровень конфиденциальности\nдля пользователя. На данный момент Blind/“слепые” (CT) и анонимные (RingCT)\nтранзакции могут выполняться только на скрытые адреса.\n\nCT + RingCT вместе = бесконечные возможности\n У обоих протоколов конфиденциальности есть свои плюсы и минусы, но одним из\nсамых заметных различий между этими двумя реализациями Particl является то, что\nу CT есть программируемые «выходы», а у RingCT - нет. Это значит, что RingCT,\nкак есть, не может использоваться в смарт-контрактах. Но это не означает, что\nего нельзя использовать в децентрализованных приложениях.  Как же это возможно,\nесли RingCT нельзя использовать в смарт-контрактах? Это одна из главных причин,\nпочему Particl сохранил в своей сети оба протокола, CT и RingCT, вместо того\nчтобы оставить только один из них. Поскольку транзакции CT имеют программируемые\nвыходы, то их можно использовать в смарт-контрактах, а затем легко связать с\nтранзакциями RingCT.  Прелесть решения Particl заключается в том, что выходы\nмогут быть отправлены с RingCT на CT для дальнейшей програмной обработки\n(например, для создания эскроу контракта), а затем так же отправлены обратно в\nRingCT. Лучшим примером, иллюстрирующим эту концепцию, является Particl\n Marketplace. Это конфиденциальная по умолчанию торговая площадка , которая \nиспользует RingCT для полной анонимизации всех транзакций. Но мало кто знает,\nчто на самом деле для своей системы условного депонирования торговая площадка\nиспользует комбинацию RingCT и CT, а не один лишь RingCT. Это потому, что\nсистема условного депонирования основана на функциональности смарт-контракта и,\nтаким образом, транзакции должны иметь программируемые выходы, следовательно\nиспользуется CT. Однако для взаимодействия со смарт-контрактом и сохранения\nанонимности пользователи отправляют ему транзакцию RingCT, которая затем\nавтоматически преобразуется торговой площадкой в транзакцию CT на время\nусловного депонирования. После удачной сделки покупатель разблокирует/открывает\nэскроу и транзакция завершается, как транзакция RingCT.\n\n\n> «Выход RingCT преобразуется в выход CT, который, в свою очередь, формирует\n«входы» контракта условного депонирования. Когда условное депонирование готово к\nдеблокированию или возмещению, оно будет напрямую передано на выход RingCT. »\n\n\n— Kewde [https://github.com/kewde/], разработчик Particl и автор OMP Library\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/]\n\n\nЭто лишь один из примеров того, как можно использовать  RingCT в полной мере\nсовместно  с  CT.  Аналогичный метод можно применить для интеграции RingCT в\nдругие протоколы или службы, такие как атомарные свопы, транзакции на сети\nLightning и в других децентрализованных приложении.\n\n. . .\n\nЕсли вам понравилась эта статья - поделитесь ею со своими друзьями и следите за\nобновлениями на particl.news, так как скоро там будут опубликованы новые статьи\nсерииParticl объясняет\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl - это участие\nМы хотим быть узнаваемыми везде, и с вашей помощью мы станем более заметными.\nДля вас это занимает секунды - подписаться на наши каналы и нажать на иконку\nколокольчика.\n\nYouTube [https://youtube.com/c/particl] Twitter\n[https://twitter.com/Particl_RU/] Mastodon [https://fosstodon.org/@particl] \nReddit [https://reddit.com/r/particl]\n\n\nПрисоединяйтесь к нашим чатам для живого общения.

На самом деле всё как раз наоборот. Биткоин-транзакции (а также публичные транзакции Particl) довольно прозрачны, мы это называем <strong>псевдонимными </strong>транзакциями. Вместо привязки к идентификации личности каждая такая транзакция привязывается к псевдонимам состоящих из различных чисел и символов, просто называемых адресами.     Возможно этого достаточно для защиты ваших данных от незаинтересованных сторон. Однако, появление надежных инструментов анализа блокчейна позволяет любой любопытной, либо мотивированной стороне начать копаться в блокчейне и отслеживать пользователей. Стало значительно проще связать такие адреса-псевдонимы с вашими идентификационными данными на бирже, в платежной системе, у продавца и т. п., когда вы совершаете платеж любому из них.По этой причине команда Particl реализовала два дополнительных протокола для конфиденциальности, которые скрывают транзакции в блокчейне.

Отрицательный результат приведет к тому, что сумма отправки все равно будет равна нулю.    Обратной стороной доказательств диапазона является то, что они довольно сильно утяжеляют блокчейн.

Для транзакций этого типа используется протокол конфиденциальности RingCT, ставший популярным благодаря Monero, но <strong>адаптированный командой Particl для работы с кодовой базой Биткоина</strong>. Это позволяет платформе получить преимущества ведущего в отрасли протокола конфиденциальности RingCT, но при этом также использовать безопасность и стабильность от сообщества разработчиков Биткоина.

Это такой <strong>тип цифровой подписи, которая выполняется одновременно многими «выходами» в рамках определенной группы RingCT выходов</strong> (представленных балансами Anon на Particl Desktop). В этом случае <strong>ни один наблюдатель не может сказать какой именно из участвующих «выходов» в этой подписи фактически подписывает и отправляет транзакцию</strong>.<br> </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h6 id=\"\"><em>Википедия описывает кольцевые подписи так:</em></h6>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>«Кольцева́я по́дпись (англ. ring signature) — вариант реализации электронной подписи, при котором известно, что сообщение подписано одним из членов списка потенциальных подписантов, но не раскрывается, кем именно. Подписант самостоятельно формирует список из произвольного числа различных лиц, включая в него и себя.

В случае RingCT цифровая подпись, использованная для выполнения транзакции, могла исходить от любого члена кольцевой группы. Пользователи помещают часть своих средств на баланс Anon. Средства, находящиеся на балансе Anon, используются для выполнения RingCT транзакций. Протокол анонимно подписывает транзакцию перед ее выполнением, <strong>используя другие имеющиеся на блокчейне Анон «выходы» в качестве отвлекающих приманок</strong>, и таким образом создает подпись, которая при проверке выглядит так, как будто бы она могла быть инициирована любым из владельцев выходов RingCT, используемых кольцевой группой. В итоге <strong>невозможно узнать, кто именно совершил эту транзакцию, потому что это мог быть кто угодно из тех, чьи «выходы» использовались кольцевой группой в качестве приманок.</strong><br>   <strong> Это эффективно анонимизирует все данные, содержащиеся в транзакции </strong>— передаваемую сумму, а также отправителя и получателя транзакции.

В клиентском приложении этот называется: <strong><em><u>NO. OF RING SIGS</u></em></strong>.Это означает простую вещь: <strong>для каждого вашего входа, задействованного для генерации вашей транзакции, будет использоваться некоторое количество других выходов для создания цифровой подписи, и это может быть подписано любым из 24 участников (например)</strong>. Значение 24 выбрано на скриншоте чуть выше. Это означает, что для маскировки транзакции будут использованы 23 чужих «выходов» в качестве отвлекающих приманок плюс реальный «выход» отправителья транзакции. В случае если транзакция использует больше чем 1 «выход» отправителья, например 3 «выхода», то это означает, что для выполнения транзакции будут сгенерированы 3 кольцевых подписей, по одной для каждого  «выхода», с 24 участниками в каждой! Это может показаться слишком сложным, но не волнуйтесь - Particl Desktop сделает все это за вас, сделает отправку транзакций RingCT такой же легкой, как любой другой транзакции.<br><strong>Чтобы создать транзакцию RingCT:</strong> просто перейдите на вкладку «Send/Convert», выберите тип транзакции «Anon», затем кликните «Advanced Options» (дополнительные параметры) и двигайте ползунок уровня конфиденциальности (NO. OF RING SIGS), который отображается в нижнем левом углу страницы. Выбранное вами значение будет равно количеству участников кольца в вашей кольцевой группе . Но вы можете и не трогать ползунок, оставив уровень конфиденциальности по умолчанию (24 участников кольца). Это будет хороший баланс между конфиденциальностью и стоимостью.<br></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h6 id=\"\"><em>Примечание.</em></h6>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Чем больше «выходов» и ложных подписантов используется для транзакции RingCT - тем дороже она становится, но также - тем более конфиденциальной она получится. Если вас не волнует стоимость транзакции и вы хотите получить лишь максимальную конфиденциальность - создавайте транзакции с максимально возможным количеством участников кольца и с максимально возможным количеством входов.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p></p><h3 id=\"--2\">Поддержание хорошего уровня конфиденциальности</h3><p>  Как общее правило, в теории и практически, <strong>RingCT становится тем более конфиденциальным, чем больше людей конвертируют свои публичные балансы в балансы Anon, </strong>тем самым создавая больше «выходов» Anon, которые будут доступны к использованию кольцевыми группами для транзакций RingCT. Это потому, что RingCT полагается на «выходы» других людей<strong>, </strong>чтобы правдоподобно отрицать какой из выходов на самом деле подписал транзакцию, и <strong>чем больше имеется выходов RingCT для подписи транзакций - тем сильнее становится аспект конфиденциальности и правдоподобного отрицания.</strong>Но, хотя «выходы» выбираются из любых выходов Anon в цепи случайным образом, все же чаще всего они выбираются из самых последних транзакций RingCT. Причина, по которой протокол работает таким образом, заключается в ответе на этот <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"><strong><u>исследовательский документ</u></strong></a>, который демонстрирует, что реальными входами можно считать те, которые самые свежие, а все приманки находятся намного глубже в цепи т.е. старые и долгое время не использовались в транзакциях.<br>Исходя из этого, <strong>рекомендуется чтобы все пользователи держали хотя бы часть средств на балансе Anon</strong> т.е. Анон «выходах», которые могут быть автоматически использованы сетью (разумеется, бесплатно для пользователей) в Анон транзакциях. Кроме того, <strong>рекомендуется чтобы пользователи совершали как можно больше транзакций Anon</strong>, и это могло бы способствовать повышению конфиденциальности всей сети. Обратите внимание, что не обязательные требования для выполнения транзакции RingCT, но чем больше людей будут это делать, тем сильнее и устойчивее сеть становится для всех.<br>Particl Marketplace использует по умолчанию именно транзакции RingCT для всех транзакций на торговой площадке. Таким образом, каждый новый пользователь торговой площадки будет добавлять новые транзакции anon в блокчейн, используя анонимные транзакции для каждой своей покупки или продажи.  Другими словами, пользователям платформы Particl не нужно делать ничего особенного кроме этого. Так как рост количества анонимных транзакций  и размер анонимного пула прямо связаны с ростом торговой площадки Particl. По мере роста ее использования транзакции RingCT будут становиться  все более и более запутанными сравнительно с  другими блокчейнами, использующими технологию RingCT.</p><h3 id=\"--3\">Скрытые адреса</h3><p> Скрытые адреса - это специальные адреса, которые можно генерировать как «одноразовые адреса приема».  Под «адресом одноразового приема» подразумевается  что каждый раз, когда отправитель использовал этот адрес для отправки некоторых монет, то создается новый адрес для следующей отправки/получения. На самом деле, на скрытый адрес можно получать платежи несколько раз, но все эти платежи будут попадать на разные «выходы», принадлежащие владельцу скрытого адреса. Это увеличивают конфиденциальность, потому что <strong>только владелец скрытого адреса может определить, принадлежит ли выход ему или нет.</strong> Не зная приватного ключа адреса, наблюдатель не сможет связать и угадать, какие  «выходы» и с каким скрытым адресом связаны даже если знает скрытые адреса. Это <strong>помогает в защите получателя транзакции от идентификации</strong>.<br>Одних лишь скрытых адресов не достаточно для защиты информации о транзакциях от хорошо финансируемого и мотивированного наблюдателя (например, государственного учреждения), но в комбинации с более сильными протоколами конфиденциальности, такими как CT или RingCT, они обеспечивают еще один уровень конфиденциальности для пользователя. <strong>На данный момент</strong> <strong>Blind/“слепые” (CT) и анонимные (RingCT) транзакции могут выполняться только на скрытые адреса.</strong></p><h3 id=\"ct-ringct-\">CT + RingCT вместе = бесконечные возможности</h3><p> У обоих протоколов конфиденциальности есть свои плюсы и минусы, но одним из самых заметных различий между этими двумя реализациями Particl является то, что у CT есть программируемые «выходы», а у RingCT - нет. Это значит, что RingCT, как есть, не может использоваться в смарт-контрактах. Но это <strong>не означает</strong>, что его нельзя использовать в децентрализованных приложениях.  Как же это возможно, если RingCT нельзя использовать в смарт-контрактах? <strong>Это одна из главных причин, почему Particl сохранил в своей сети оба протокола, CT и RingCT, вместо того чтобы оставить только один из них</strong>. Поскольку транзакции CT имеют программируемые выходы, то их можно использовать в смарт-контрактах, а затем легко связать с транзакциями RingCT.  Прелесть решения Particl заключается в том, что выходы могут быть отправлены с RingCT на CT для дальнейшей програмной обработки (например, для создания эскроу контракта), а затем так же отправлены обратно в RingCT. Лучшим примером, иллюстрирующим эту концепцию, является Particl  Marketplace. Это <strong>конфиденциальная по умолчанию торговая площадка </strong>, которая <strong>использует RingCT для полной анонимизации всех транзакций</strong>. Но мало кто знает, что на самом деле для своей системы условного депонирования торговая площадка использует комбинацию RingCT и CT, а не один лишь RingCT. Это потому, что система условного депонирования основана на функциональности смарт-контракта и, таким образом, транзакции должны иметь программируемые выходы, следовательно используется CT. Однако для взаимодействия со смарт-контрактом и сохранения анонимности пользователи отправляют ему транзакцию RingCT, которая затем автоматически преобразуется торговой площадкой в транзакцию CT на время условного депонирования. После удачной сделки покупатель разблокирует/открывает эскроу и транзакция завершается, как транзакция RingCT.<br> </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>\n<p><em>«Выход RingCT преобразуется в выход CT, который, в свою очередь, формирует «входы» контракта условного депонирования.

На самом деле всё как раз наоборот. Биткоин-транзакции (а также публичные транзакции Particl) довольно прозрачны, мы это называем <strong>псевдонимными </strong>транзакциями. Вместо привязки к идентификации личности каждая такая транзакция привязывается к псевдонимам состоящих из различных чисел и символов, просто называемых адресами.     Возможно этого достаточно для защиты ваших данных от незаинтересованных сторон.

Из-за такой вот “тяжелой” природы<strong> эти доказательства диапазона занимают большую часть общего размера  Blind/“слепой” транзакции</strong>.   Эта неудобная реальность приводит к тому, что при использовании этого протокола транзакции имеют больший размер, чем обычные публичные. Транзакция большего размера, кроме более высоких комиссий,  также приводит к тому, что и размер блокчейна экспоненциально растет по мере использования.  Таким образом, работа с более громоздким блокчейном становится все более и более неудобной по мере того, как в нем будет записано все больше и больше транзакций CT.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h6 id=\"\"><em>Примечание.</em></h6>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Эта проблема масштабируемости - одна из основных причин, по которым команда Particl задержала перенос своей реализации RingCT в основную сеть.

Для транзакций этого типа используется протокол конфиденциальности RingCT, ставший популярным благодаря Monero, но <strong>адаптированный командой Particl для работы с кодовой базой Биткоина</strong>. Это позволяет платформе получить преимущества ведущего в отрасли протокола конфиденциальности RingCT, но при этом также использовать безопасность и стабильность от сообщества разработчиков Биткоина.

В случае RingCT цифровая подпись, использованная для выполнения транзакции, могла исходить от любого члена кольцевой группы. Пользователи помещают часть своих средств на баланс Anon. Средства, находящиеся на балансе Anon, используются для выполнения RingCT транзакций. Протокол анонимно подписывает транзакцию перед ее выполнением, <strong>используя другие имеющиеся на блокчейне Анон «выходы» в качестве отвлекающих приманок</strong>, и таким образом создает подпись, которая при проверке выглядит так, как будто бы она могла быть инициирована любым из владельцев выходов RingCT, используемых кольцевой группой. В итоге <strong>невозможно узнать, кто именно совершил эту транзакцию, потому что это мог быть кто угодно из тех, чьи «выходы» использовались кольцевой группой в качестве приманок.</strong><br>   <strong> Это эффективно анонимизирует все данные, содержащиеся в транзакции </strong>— передаваемую сумму, а также отправителя и получателя транзакции.

В клиентском приложении этот называется: <strong><em><u>NO. OF RING SIGS</u></em></strong>.Это означает простую вещь: <strong>для каждого вашего входа, задействованного для генерации вашей транзакции, будет использоваться некоторое количество других выходов для создания цифровой подписи, и это может быть подписано любым из 24 участников (например)</strong>. Значение 24 выбрано на скриншоте чуть выше. Это означает, что для маскировки транзакции будут использованы 23 чужих «выходов» в качестве отвлекающих приманок плюс реальный «выход» отправителья транзакции. В случае если транзакция использует больше чем 1 «выход» отправителья, например 3 «выхода», то это означает, что для выполнения транзакции будут сгенерированы 3 кольцевых подписей, по одной для каждого  «выхода», с 24 участниками в каждой! Это может показаться слишком сложным, но не волнуйтесь - Particl Desktop сделает все это за вас, сделает отправку транзакций RingCT такой же легкой, как любой другой транзакции.<br><strong>Чтобы создать транзакцию RingCT:</strong> просто перейдите на вкладку «Send/Convert», выберите тип транзакции «Anon», затем кликните «Advanced Options» (дополнительные параметры) и двигайте ползунок уровня конфиденциальности (NO. OF RING SIGS), который отображается в нижнем левом углу страницы. Выбранное вами значение будет равно количеству участников кольца в вашей кольцевой группе . Но вы можете и не трогать ползунок, оставив уровень конфиденциальности по умолчанию (24 участников кольца). Это будет хороший баланс между конфиденциальностью и стоимостью.<br></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h6 id=\"\"><em>Примечание.</em></h6>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Чем больше «выходов» и ложных подписантов используется для транзакции RingCT - тем дороже она становится, но также - тем более конфиденциальной она получится. Если вас не волнует стоимость транзакции и вы хотите получить лишь максимальную конфиденциальность - создавайте транзакции с максимально возможным количеством участников кольца и с максимально возможным количеством входов.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p></p><h3 id=\"--2\">Поддержание хорошего уровня конфиденциальности</h3><p>  Как общее правило, в теории и практически, <strong>RingCT становится тем более конфиденциальным, чем больше людей конвертируют свои публичные балансы в балансы Anon, </strong>тем самым создавая больше «выходов» Anon, которые будут доступны к использованию кольцевыми группами для транзакций RingCT. Это потому, что RingCT полагается на «выходы» других людей<strong>, </strong>чтобы правдоподобно отрицать какой из выходов на самом деле подписал транзакцию, и <strong>чем больше имеется выходов RingCT для подписи транзакций - тем сильнее становится аспект конфиденциальности и правдоподобного отрицания.</strong>Но, хотя «выходы» выбираются из любых выходов Anon в цепи случайным образом, все же чаще всего они выбираются из самых последних транзакций RingCT. Причина, по которой протокол работает таким образом, заключается в ответе на этот <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"><strong><u>исследовательский документ</u></strong></a>, который демонстрирует, что реальными входами можно считать те, которые самые свежие, а все приманки находятся намного глубже в цепи т.е. старые и долгое время не использовались в транзакциях.<br>Исходя из этого, <strong>рекомендуется чтобы все пользователи держали хотя бы часть средств на балансе Anon</strong> т.е. Анон «выходах», которые могут быть автоматически использованы сетью (разумеется, бесплатно для пользователей) в Анон транзакциях. Кроме того, <strong>рекомендуется чтобы пользователи совершали как можно больше транзакций Anon</strong>, и это могло бы способствовать повышению конфиденциальности всей сети. Обратите внимание, что не обязательные требования для выполнения транзакции RingCT, но чем больше людей будут это делать, тем сильнее и устойчивее сеть становится для всех.<br>Particl Marketplace использует по умолчанию именно транзакции RingCT для всех транзакций на торговой площадке. Таким образом, каждый новый пользователь торговой площадки будет добавлять новые транзакции anon в блокчейн, используя анонимные транзакции для каждой своей покупки или продажи.  Другими словами, пользователям платформы Particl не нужно делать ничего особенного кроме этого. Так как рост количества анонимных транзакций  и размер анонимного пула прямо связаны с ростом торговой площадки Particl. По мере роста ее использования транзакции RingCT будут становиться  все более и более запутанными сравнительно с  другими блокчейнами, использующими технологию RingCT.</p><h3 id=\"--3\">Скрытые адреса</h3><p> Скрытые адреса - это специальные адреса, которые можно генерировать как «одноразовые адреса приема».  Под «адресом одноразового приема» подразумевается  что каждый раз, когда отправитель использовал этот адрес для отправки некоторых монет, то создается новый адрес для следующей отправки/получения. На самом деле, на скрытый адрес можно получать платежи несколько раз, но все эти платежи будут попадать на разные «выходы», принадлежащие владельцу скрытого адреса. Это увеличивают конфиденциальность, потому что <strong>только владелец скрытого адреса может определить, принадлежит ли выход ему или нет.</strong> Не зная приватного ключа адреса, наблюдатель не сможет связать и угадать, какие  «выходы» и с каким скрытым адресом связаны даже если знает скрытые адреса. Это <strong>помогает в защите получателя транзакции от идентификации</strong>.<br>Одних лишь скрытых адресов не достаточно для защиты информации о транзакциях от хорошо финансируемого и мотивированного наблюдателя (например, государственного учреждения), но в комбинации с более сильными протоколами конфиденциальности, такими как CT или RingCT, они обеспечивают еще один уровень конфиденциальности для пользователя. <strong>На данный момент</strong> <strong>Blind/“слепые” (CT) и анонимные (RingCT) транзакции могут выполняться только на скрытые адреса.</strong></p><h3 id=\"ct-ringct-\">CT + RingCT вместе = бесконечные возможности</h3><p> У обоих протоколов конфиденциальности есть свои плюсы и минусы, но одним из самых заметных различий между этими двумя реализациями Particl является то, что у CT есть программируемые «выходы», а у RingCT - нет. Это значит, что RingCT, как есть, не может использоваться в смарт-контрактах. Но это <strong>не означает</strong>, что его нельзя использовать в децентрализованных приложениях.  Как же это возможно, если RingCT нельзя использовать в смарт-контрактах? <strong>Это одна из главных причин, почему Particl сохранил в своей сети оба протокола, CT и RingCT, вместо того чтобы оставить только один из них</strong>. Поскольку транзакции CT имеют программируемые выходы, то их можно использовать в смарт-контрактах, а затем легко связать с транзакциями RingCT.  Прелесть решения Particl заключается в том, что выходы могут быть отправлены с RingCT на CT для дальнейшей програмной обработки (например, для создания эскроу контракта), а затем так же отправлены обратно в RingCT. Лучшим примером, иллюстрирующим эту концепцию, является Particl  Marketplace. Это <strong>конфиденциальная по умолчанию торговая площадка </strong>, которая <strong>использует RingCT для полной анонимизации всех транзакций</strong>. Но мало кто знает, что на самом деле для своей системы условного депонирования торговая площадка использует комбинацию RingCT и CT, а не один лишь RingCT. Это потому, что система условного депонирования основана на функциональности смарт-контракта и, таким образом, транзакции должны иметь программируемые выходы, следовательно используется CT. Однако для взаимодействия со смарт-контрактом и сохранения анонимности пользователи отправляют ему транзакцию RingCT, которая затем автоматически преобразуется торговой площадкой в транзакцию CT на время условного депонирования. После удачной сделки покупатель разблокирует/открывает эскроу и транзакция завершается, как транзакция RingCT.<br> </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>\n<p><em>«Выход RingCT преобразуется в выход CT, который, в свою очередь, формирует «входы» контракта условного депонирования.

Однако, появление надежных инструментов анализа блокчейна позволяет любой любопытной, либо мотивированной стороне начать копаться в блокчейне и отслеживать пользователей. Стало значительно проще связать такие адреса-псевдонимы с вашими идентификационными данными на бирже, в платежной системе, у продавца и т. п., когда вы совершаете платеж любому из них.По этой причине команда Particl реализовала два дополнительных протокола для конфиденциальности, которые скрывают транзакции в блокчейне.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
