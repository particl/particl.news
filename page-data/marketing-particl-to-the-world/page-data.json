This blog\npost will answer that question in detail and clarify the team’s position and\nstrategy as we progress onward.\n\nTable of Contents\n * Putting Marketing in Context\n * Upcoming Marketing Initiatives\n * BasicSwap; A Door Major Opener\n * Community Empowerment\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPutting Marketing in Context\nFirst thing first, it’s essential to define what we mean by “marketing” to avoid\nany confusion. Marketing is an umbrella term that touches on brand awareness,\nPR, product placement, outreach, relationship building, and any other effort to\ngain adoption and new users or fans. It’s a wide range of actions converging\ntowards making Particl more known, liked, and used.\n\nWhy do Marketing?\nIn the case of Particl, marketing has two clear objectives.\n\n * Gain new users for Particl products (i.e., Particl Marketplace or BasicSwap)\n * Increase the number of coin holders and project advocates.\n\nFor marketing to have any real impact on the course of the project, results need\nto be long-lasting. Any new user, coin holder, or advocate gained from any\nmarketing campaign has to stick around for some time and be active within the\necosystem. When it comes to brand awareness campaigns, their message has to\nstick around and be clear.\n\nThis strategical and best value approach to marketing ensures that the project\nonly spends resources towards effective initiatives rather than adopting a\n“spray and pray” strategy that can work for more prosperous projects, but at an\nextreme cost.\n\nHow to Achieve our Marketing Objectives?\nTo achieve the two objectives mentioned above, we use two fundamental approaches\nto marketing.\n\nProduct-focused marketing: Product-focused marketing puts the spotlight on what\nproducts the project offers and what benefits they give to targeted audiences.\nThis aims at making people interested in the end products and is directly linked\nto adoption efforts.\n\nBrand awareness and notoriety building: The other approach is to increase\nParticl’s brand awareness and notoriety. In other words, it’s about being part\nof “the discussion” and being a project that people know about even if they’ve\nnever really used it. The more brand awareness and notoriety a project has, the\nmore free coverage it gets and the faster its community grows. \n\nThese two approaches will be leveraged by different types of marketing campaigns\n(mentioned a bit further down this post).\n\nHow is Marketing Funded at Particl?\nParticl is not an overly-funded project born out of an ICO or any other kind of\ncrowdfunding mechanism. Instead, it’s a humble community project that operates\nout of voluntary community donations through a decentralized and democratic\ntreasury system.\n\nThis means the project does not possess millions of dollars to pump into very\nlarge-scale marketing campaigns. It also means it cannot afford many of the\n“pay-to-play” marketing avenues that blockchain projects with deeper pockets\nusually leverage.\n\nAdditionally, because the team gets its funding paid in PART, and due to current\nlow liquidity on trading exchanges for PART pairs, the team has to be very\ncareful about how it spends marketing funds as to not cause any significant\ndownward pressure, essentially nullifying any marketing gains.\n\nMarketing Expectations\nDue to the current liquidity situation and the general costs of marketing within\nthe blockchain industry, it’s important to keep expectations realistic and plan\naround that reality. That’s what the team has done with this marketing strategy.\n\nThat’s also why marketing is currently being deployed gradually and\nstrategically, one initiative at a time. As we move forward in time, many\ninitiatives will start stacking up and run in parallel, giving a better sense of\nbeing widespread.\n\nAdditionally, expectations need to match the status of each Particl product.\nIndeed, Particl V3, for example, is still a beta piece of software that can\nstill be complicated to use for most people other than a few more technically\napt niches. Mind you, that is alright and is part of the journey as Particl\nevolves to an ecosystem that’s much more user-friendly. Still, it also means\nthat marketing the project towards audiences that are not ready to use the\nproduct might not be the most cost-effective strategy. Hence, selecting the\nright audiences to target is key.\n\nUpcoming Marketing Initiatives\nNow that we’ve mentioned all of the above considerations, it’s time to take a\ndeeper dive into the various marketing initiatives that are planned or are in\nprogress.\n\nWhat we've done recently\nRe-initiating direct mail marketing Shortly before the release of Particl V3 on\nmainnet, we’ve re-initiated our newsletter communications. This aims to\nre-engage people who’ve shown interest in Particl in the past and stay connected\nwith current fans. Direct mail marketing is a basic but powerful marketing tool\nand will be used sporadically (we won’t spam your inbox) for essential and\nbundled communications pieces. \n\nIf you still haven’t subscribed to our newsletter, don’t hesitate to do so; it’s\nthe best way to stay in touch! \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Particl Academy The Particl Academy is the\nuser-friendly guide to get started with Particl and become more familiar with\nit. It’s a critical piece of information required for newcomers to be able to\nstart using the platform without any hassle. \n\nThis can be the difference between someone interested but who gives up because\nit’s too difficult to get started and someone who sticks around. To browse the\nParticl Academy, simply head over to https://academy.particl.io/ \n\nProduct marketing New roadmap The new development roadmap is not necessarily a\nmarketing item in the proper sense, but it’s nonetheless a vital part of the\nmarketing strategy. That’s because that is where new people usually look to see\nwhat’s coming up next for a project and what is its long-term viability. \n\nThe new roadmap was carefully crafted to make user adoption easier by improving\nthe platform’s accessibility, usability, and user-friendliness. In addition, it\ncommunicates Particl’s long-term vision for its products and ecosystem, and\nhelps get new passionate supporters to stick around for the long haul. \n\nProduct marketing What's currently in progress\nNew website Particl’s new website (Particl.io) is set to become the cornerstone\nof any upcoming marketing effort. That’s because that’s where new people land\nwhen they first hear about a project or when they get curious about it through a\nmarketing campaign they’ve been exposed to. That’s also why we’ve been waiting\nfor its release before activating a few initiatives; we want Particl to look its\nbest and tell its story the way it should. This will inevitably lead to better\nconversion rates! \n\nOn that note, we are excited to announce that the new website will go live this\ncoming Tuesday, the 26th of October, 2021. So make sure to be around next week\nfor its launch, we’re sure you’re going to be delighted by it and will want to\nshow it to everybody! \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Digital ads (Twitter, Reddit) Digital ads are\nhelpful for two different reasons. For one, they can address both marketing\nobjectives by being either product or brand-focused. \n\nSecondly, they provide valuable data on the success of campaigns which allows us\nto test different messages and stories as well as different audiences. We can\nthen use these data points to tune all other marketing campaigns and focus on\nwhat really works. The intel we can get out of digital ad campaigns is why we\nare already in the process of planning them and want to deploy them before a few\nother initiatives. \n\nPreparations for digital ads have already begun, and this initiative will\ngradually ramp up within the next three months. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing More stories on Particl News At this time,\nParticl’s blog almost only contains news and updates. While that’s interesting\nfor those already a fan of the project, it doesn’t help convert new people into\nadvocates or users. Having more story-driven content will help better explain\nParticl’s story and mission, define its brand, and put the spotlight on the\nbigger picture (why we do what we do and why you need it). Additionally,\nSEO-friendly story contents help drive more traffic to the website. \n\nThis initiative is currently in progress as we’ve started working with a few\nwriters. Stories should soon start appearing on Particl News within their own\ndedicated “Stories” section. Make sure to have a read when you see a new story\ncome out and share it with the people you think will be interested in it! \n\nBrand awareness Reboot of the Part-Time Show You might remember the Part-Time\nShow, the podcast by Particl ambassador Dr. Kapil. As part of the Particl\nreboot, we also thought of rebooting the Part-Time Show with it, only this time,\ndifferently. Leveraging the new interactive Clubhouse application, the new show\nwill feature Dr. Kapil along with Joe Fisher, e-commerce expert. \n\nIt will talk about a wide variety of topics related to Particl, including\ne-commerce, privacy, data security, decentralization, the impact of distributed\nnetworks on democracy, economics, censorship, and much more. While not a\nParticl-centric show itself, the new formula of the show is going to be much\nmore dynamic. It intends on building relationships and initiating thoughtful\ndiscussions with people who understand the critical and modern issues of today’s\nsociety. \n\nClubhouse can be defined as a mix between a podcast social media and LinkedIn.\nWe hope that you join along the weekly episodes and participate in the\ndiscussion with us. You might just meet some fascinating folks! More information\nis to come about this in the next few days as we near the first episode. \n\nBrand awareness New team member To help with the many marketing tasks we have on\nour deck, a new team member will join the communications and marketing team in\nNovember. This new team member, which will mostly fill the role of a\ncommunications assistant, will be critical in allowing the team to deploy\nmultiple initiatives in parallel and amplify our efforts. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Community budget Also to help with marketing\nand encourage community initiatives, the team will be setting up and deploying a\ncommunity marketing budget very soon. At the time of this writing, a group has\nbeen formed on Element with a few community members eager to help spread the\nword and deploy initiatives of their own. A community budget intends on\nsupporting these go-getters with resources from the team. \n\nLookup the Community Empowerment section of this blog post further down below\nfor more information on how to get involved. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Occasional Reddit AMAs With the Particl reboot\ngoing on strong, there are a lot of things changing around the project and a ton\nto look out for. But with so much information, it’s possible that you may have\nsome questions. So from time to time, the Particl team will run AMAs on its\nsub-Reddit and pin it so that anyone can ask their questions and have the answer\ndisplayed prominently for all others to see. This should help with transparency\nand circulating important information to the community. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing What comes after\nWider distribution of press releases Distributing press releases in quality\npublications will lead to more organic coverage as editors and writers scout PR\npublications daily for exciting content. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing More podcast appearances and interviews With\nimproving Particl's brand awareness in mind, appearing in more podcasts and\ninterviews will help spread the Particl word further and expose the project to\nmany more people. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Publish more documentation For Particl to gain\nadoption, using the platform and understanding how to use it must be as easy as\npossible. Publishing more educational, informational, and technical\ndocumentation will help with that. \n\nProduct marketing Increase social media activity and exposure Crypto Twitter is\nwhere it's at, and Particl needs to have better exposure within that community\nif it wants to go viral. So improving Particl's social media exposure and taking\npart in the discussion is important and planned for the near future. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Integrate other coins into Particl Desktop \nBecause so much has changed with Particl V3, support for other coins is\ntemporarily disabled. We plan on adding that feature back right after releasing\nthe SMSG Manager (roadmap item). Integrating more coins and making it easier for\ntheir users to acquire PART increases the potential for adoption within these\ncommunities. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing New exchange listings Getting listed on new\nexchanges is a no-brainer to improve liquidity, exposure and make the platform\nmore accessible. The team is currently in negotiation with two exchanges and\nshould have more news on the subject soon. More exchange listings are planned as\nlong as the listing costs are reasonable, and the exchange can provide real\nvalue back to the project. \n\nBrand awareness Seed the marketplace with more listings A few months ago, a CCS proposal\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html] that\nsuggested seeding the marketplace with many listings was published (and funded).\nAdding thousands of listings will give the marketplace the boost it needs to get\nthe ball rolling and become a vibrant e-commerce platform. This initiative is\ncurrently under active development. \n\nProduct marketing It obviously doesn't stop here, but the team will work on the\nitems mentioned above in the short to mid-term. If you have any marketing ideas\nor suggestions, feel free to reach out to the team to discuss them.\n\nBasicSwap; A Major Door Opener\nWhen it comes to product-based marketing, we usually think about Particl\nMarketplace because it’s the project’s flagship application; a one-of-a-kind\ndecentralized and private marketplace like none other. But shortly, a new\nParticl-made product with excellent marketing potential will go live in open\nbeta: BasicSwap.\n\nAs you might know by now, BasicSwap is a cross-chain and private decentralized\nexchange that uses atomic swap and the SMSG network. It lets two users who don’t\nknow each other safely exchange cryptocurrencies from two different blockchains.\nBasicSwap is set to become a crucial aspect of the Particl ecosystem and, at the\nsame time, the project’s marketing strategy.\n\nIncidentally, speculation is the most popular and widespread use case for\ncryptocurrencies. And as it becomes increasingly difficult and burdening to\nregister and trade on centralized exchanges, many people are starting to look\nfor decentralized solutions to suit their needs. As a result, the market share\nof decentralized marketplaces and the number of users grows every day. That’s an\nexcellent opportunity for BasicSwap and the Particl project!\n\nBasicSwap’s unique propositions, namely that it is cross-chain compatible,\nprivate, has order books, and supports Monero, are sure to turn some heads.\nBasicSwap is indeed set to generate adoption for the Particl ecosystem just on\nits own, independent of any marketplace activity. But, then, as it becomes an\nintegrated part of Particl Desktop, its users are likely to bleed into other\napplications (i.e., Particl Marketplace), making them users of the Particl\necosystem as a whole rather than just one specific app. That’s the beauty of an\nall-inclusive decentralized ecosystem of apps and Particl's vision slowly coming\nto fruitition!\n\nIn other words, the addition of BasicSwap is much more than just a new useful\napp; it’s a massive load of marketing ammo both for itself and the broader\nParticl ecosystem. So expect marketing to be adapted as such and keep it in mind\nwhen you talk about Particl to other people.\n\nCommunity Empowerment\nThe best marketing tool for any crypto project is the power of its community.\nThat’s why we want to encourage community initiatives as much as possible with a\nnew dedicated budget!\n\nDo you have any marketing, outreach, or PR initiative that you’d like to lead?\nThen simply reach out to the team on Element, Discord, or Telegram with a\nwritten proposal explaining your project. If it gets approved, you’ll be asked\nto publish it on the CCS [https://ccs.particl.io]. Once your proposal is live,\nthe team will then fund it using its dedicated community budget.\n\nPublishing community-led marketing initiatives on CCS ensures the maximum level\nof transparency, lets others see what kind of efforts are ongoing, and helps\ndetermine what can people do to help. We highly encourage you all to\nparticipate; the more of us that spread the good word, the further it reaches!\n\n> Note 1: Keep in mind that we constantly receive many ideas with varying levels\nof detail. Before reaching out, make sure to think of all the details and write\nthem down in your proposal. You also need to be able to lead that initiative\nyourself or delegate tasks on your own. The team can provide you with funding in\nPART and help you get started, but community-led initiatives are ultimately\nheaded by whoever makes a proposal.\n> Note 2: If you have suggestions or marketing ideas you may not have the time to\nlead, don’t hesitate to contact the team regardless. We’ll determine whether the\nidea is viable and if it is possible to integrate it within our workflow.\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nIf you haven’t already done so, we invite you to subscribe to our newsletter so\nthat you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive content.

In addition, it communicates Particl’s long-term vision for its products and ecosystem, and helps get new passionate supporters to stick around for the long haul.\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Product marketing</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n            </div><!-- tabs close-->\n        </div><!-- col close-->\n            </div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <h2>What's currently in progress</h2>\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck1\">New website</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Particl’s new website (Particl.io) is set to become the cornerstone of any upcoming marketing effort. That’s because that’s where new people land when they first hear about a project or when they get curious about it through a marketing campaign they’ve been exposed to. That’s also why we’ve been waiting for its release before activating a few initiatives; we want Particl to look its best and tell its story the way it should. This will inevitably lead to better conversion rates!\n                        <br>\n\n                        </br>\n                            On that note, we are excited to announce that <b>the new website will go live this coming Tuesday, the 26th of October, 2021</b>. So make sure to be around next week for its launch, we’re sure you’re going to be delighted by it and will want to show it to everybody!\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Brand awareness</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Product marketing</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck2\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck2\">Digital ads (Twitter, Reddit)</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Digital ads are helpful for two different reasons. For one, they can address both marketing objectives by being either product or brand-focused. \n                        <br>\n                        </br>\n                            Secondly, they provide valuable data on the success of campaigns which allows us to test different messages and stories as well as different audiences. We can then use these data points to tune all other marketing campaigns and focus on what really works. The intel we can get out of digital ad campaigns is why we are already in the process of planning them and want to deploy them before a few other initiatives.\n                        <br>\n                        </br>\n                        <b>Preparations for digital ads have already begun, and this initiative will gradually ramp up within the next three months.</b> \n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Brand awareness</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Product marketing</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck3\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck3\">More stories on Particl News</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            At this time, Particl’s blog almost only contains news and updates. While that’s interesting for those already a fan of the project, it doesn’t help convert new people into advocates or users. Having more story-driven content will help better explain Particl’s story and mission, define its brand, and put the spotlight on the bigger picture (why we do what we do and why you need it). Additionally, SEO-friendly story contents help drive more traffic to the website.\n                        <br>\n                        </br>\n                            This initiative is currently in progress as we’ve started working with a few writers. Stories should soon start appearing on Particl News within their own dedicated “Stories” section.

As part of the Particl reboot, we also thought of rebooting the Part-Time Show with it, only this time, differently. Leveraging the new interactive Clubhouse application, the new show will feature Dr. Kapil along with Joe Fisher, e-commerce expert.\n                        <br>\n                        </br>\n                            It will talk about a wide variety of topics related to Particl, including e-commerce, privacy, data security, decentralization, the impact of distributed networks on democracy, economics, censorship, and much more. While not a Particl-centric show itself, the new formula of the show is going to be much more dynamic. It intends on building relationships and initiating thoughtful discussions with people who understand the critical and modern issues of today’s society.\n                        <br>\n                        </br>\n                            Clubhouse can be defined as a mix between a podcast social media and LinkedIn.

If you have any marketing ideas or suggestions, feel free to reach out to the team to discuss them.</p><h2 id=\"basicswap-a-major-door-opener\">BasicSwap; A Major Door Opener</h2><p>When it comes to product-based marketing, we usually think about Particl Marketplace because it’s the project’s flagship application; a one-of-a-kind decentralized and private marketplace like none other. But shortly, a new Particl-made product with excellent marketing potential will go live in open beta: BasicSwap.</p><p>As you might know by now, BasicSwap is a cross-chain and private decentralized exchange that uses atomic swap and the SMSG network. It lets two users who don’t know each other safely exchange cryptocurrencies from two different blockchains. BasicSwap is set to become a crucial aspect of the Particl ecosystem and, at the same time, the project’s marketing strategy.</p><p>Incidentally, speculation is the most popular and widespread use case for cryptocurrencies. And as it becomes increasingly difficult and burdening to register and trade on centralized exchanges, many people are starting to look for decentralized solutions to suit their needs. As a result, the market share of decentralized marketplaces and the number of users grows every day. That’s an excellent opportunity for BasicSwap and the Particl project!</p><p>BasicSwap’s unique propositions, namely that it is cross-chain compatible, private, has order books, and supports Monero, are sure to turn some heads. BasicSwap is indeed set to generate adoption for the Particl ecosystem just on its own, independent of any marketplace activity. But, then, as it becomes an integrated part of Particl Desktop, its users are likely to bleed into other applications (i.e., Particl Marketplace), making them users of the Particl ecosystem as a whole rather than just one specific app. That’s the beauty of an all-inclusive decentralized ecosystem of apps and Particl's vision slowly coming to fruitition!</p><p>In other words, the addition of BasicSwap is much more than just a new useful app; it’s a massive load of marketing ammo both for itself and the broader Particl ecosystem. So expect marketing to be adapted as such and keep it in mind when you talk about Particl to other people.</p><h2 id=\"community-empowerment\">Community Empowerment</h2><p>The best marketing tool for any crypto project is the power of its community. That’s why we want to encourage community initiatives as much as possible with a new dedicated budget!</p><p>Do you have any marketing, outreach, or PR initiative that you’d like to lead? Then simply reach out to the team on Element, Discord, or Telegram with a written proposal explaining your project. If it gets approved, you’ll be asked to publish it on the <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io\">CCS</a>. Once your proposal is live, the team will then fund it using its dedicated community budget.</p><p>Publishing community-led marketing initiatives on CCS ensures the maximum level of transparency, lets others see what kind of efforts are ongoing, and helps determine what can people do to help. We highly encourage you all to participate; the more of us that spread the good word, the further it reaches!</p><blockquote><strong>Note 1: </strong><em>Keep in mind that we constantly receive many ideas with varying levels of detail. Before reaching out, make sure to think of all the details and write them down in your proposal. You also need to be able to lead that initiative yourself or delegate tasks on your own. The team can provide you with funding in PART and help you get started, but community-led initiatives are ultimately headed by whoever makes a proposal.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Note 2: </strong><em>If you have suggestions or marketing ideas you may not have the time to lead, don’t hesitate to contact the team regardless. We’ll determine whether the idea is viable and if it is possible to integrate it within our workflow.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"subscribe-to-our-newsletter\">Subscribe to our Newsletter</h2><p>If you haven’t already done so, we invite you to subscribe to our newsletter so that you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive content.

This blog post will answer that question in detail and clarify the team’s position and strategy as we progress onward.</p><h1 id=\"table-of-contents\">Table of Contents</h1><ul><li><strong><a href=\"#putting-marketing-in-context\">Putting Marketing in Context</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#upcoming-marketing-initiatives\">Upcoming Marketing Initiatives</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#basicswap-a-major-door-opener\">BasicSwap; A Door Major Opener</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#community-empowerment\">Community Empowerment</a></strong></li></ul><hr><h2 id=\"putting-marketing-in-context\">Putting Marketing in Context</h2><p>First thing first, it’s essential to define what we mean by “marketing” to avoid any confusion. Marketing is an umbrella term that touches on brand awareness, PR, product placement, outreach, relationship building, and any other effort to gain adoption and new users or fans. It’s a wide range of actions converging towards making Particl more known, liked, and used.</p><h3 id=\"why-do-marketing\">Why do Marketing?</h3><p>In the case of Particl, marketing has two clear objectives.</p><ul><li>Gain new users for Particl products (i.e., Particl Marketplace or BasicSwap)</li><li>Increase the number of coin holders and project advocates.</li></ul><p>For marketing to have any real impact on the course of the project, results need to be long-lasting. Any new user, coin holder, or advocate gained from any marketing campaign has to stick around for some time and be active within the ecosystem. When it comes to brand awareness campaigns, their message has to stick around and be clear.</p><p>This strategical and best value approach to marketing ensures that the project only spends resources towards effective initiatives rather than adopting a “spray and pray” strategy that can work for more prosperous projects, but at an extreme cost.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-achieve-our-marketing-objectives\">How to Achieve our Marketing Objectives?</h3><p>To achieve the two objectives mentioned above, we use two fundamental approaches to marketing.</p><p><strong>Product-focused marketing: </strong>Product-focused marketing puts the spotlight on what products the project offers and what benefits they give to targeted audiences. This aims at making people interested in the end products and is directly linked to adoption efforts.</p><p><strong>Brand awareness and notoriety building: </strong>The other approach is to increase Particl’s brand awareness and notoriety. In other words, it’s about being part of “the discussion” and being a project that people know about even if they’ve never really used it. The more brand awareness and notoriety a project has, the more free coverage it gets and the faster its community grows. </p><p>These two approaches will be leveraged by different types of marketing campaigns (mentioned a bit further down this post).</p><h3 id=\"how-is-marketing-funded-at-particl\">How is Marketing Funded at Particl?</h3><p>Particl is not an overly-funded project born out of an ICO or any other kind of crowdfunding mechanism. Instead, it’s a humble community project that operates out of voluntary community donations through a decentralized and democratic treasury system.</p><p>This means the project does not possess millions of dollars to pump into very large-scale marketing campaigns. It also means it cannot afford many of the “pay-to-play” marketing avenues that blockchain projects with deeper pockets usually leverage.</p><p>Additionally, because the team gets its funding paid in PART, and due to current low liquidity on trading exchanges for PART pairs, the team has to be very careful about how it spends marketing funds as to not cause any significant downward pressure, essentially nullifying any marketing gains.</p><h3 id=\"marketing-expectations\">Marketing Expectations</h3><p>Due to the current liquidity situation and the general costs of marketing within the blockchain industry, it’s important to keep expectations realistic and plan around that reality. That’s what the team has done with this marketing strategy.</p><p>That’s also why marketing is currently being deployed gradually and strategically, one initiative at a time. As we move forward in time, many initiatives will start stacking up and run in parallel, giving a better sense of being widespread.</p><p>Additionally, expectations need to match the status of each Particl product. Indeed, Particl V3, for example, is still a beta piece of software that can still be complicated to use for most people other than a few more technically apt niches. Mind you, that is alright and is part of the journey as Particl evolves to an ecosystem that’s much more user-friendly. Still, it also means that marketing the project towards audiences that are not ready to use the product might not be the most cost-effective strategy. Hence, selecting the right audiences to target is key.</p><h2 id=\"upcoming-marketing-initiatives\">Upcoming Marketing Initiatives</h2><p>Now that we’ve mentioned all of the above considerations, it’s time to take a deeper dive into the various marketing initiatives that are planned or are in progress.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <h2>What we've done recently</h2>\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">Re-initiating direct mail marketing</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Shortly before the release of Particl V3 on mainnet, we’ve re-initiated our newsletter communications.

In addition, it communicates Particl’s long-term vision for its products and ecosystem, and helps get new passionate supporters to stick around for the long haul.\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Product marketing</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n            </div><!-- tabs close-->\n        </div><!-- col close-->\n            </div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <h2>What's currently in progress</h2>\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck1\">New website</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Particl’s new website (Particl.io) is set to become the cornerstone of any upcoming marketing effort. That’s because that’s where new people land when they first hear about a project or when they get curious about it through a marketing campaign they’ve been exposed to. That’s also why we’ve been waiting for its release before activating a few initiatives; we want Particl to look its best and tell its story the way it should. This will inevitably lead to better conversion rates!\n                        <br>\n\n                        <br>\n                            On that note, we are excited to announce that <b>the new website will go live this coming Tuesday, the 26th of October, 2021</b>. So make sure to be around next week for its launch, we’re sure you’re going to be delighted by it and will want to show it to everybody!\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Brand awareness</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Product marketing</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck2\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck2\">Digital ads (Twitter, Reddit)</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Digital ads are helpful for two different reasons. For one, they can address both marketing objectives by being either product or brand-focused. \n                        <br>\n                        <br>\n                            Secondly, they provide valuable data on the success of campaigns which allows us to test different messages and stories as well as different audiences. We can then use these data points to tune all other marketing campaigns and focus on what really works. The intel we can get out of digital ad campaigns is why we are already in the process of planning them and want to deploy them before a few other initiatives.\n                        <br>\n                        <br>\n                        <b>Preparations for digital ads have already begun, and this initiative will gradually ramp up within the next three months.</b> \n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Brand awareness</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Product marketing</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck3\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck3\">More stories on Particl News</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            At this time, Particl’s blog almost only contains news and updates. While that’s interesting for those already a fan of the project, it doesn’t help convert new people into advocates or users. Having more story-driven content will help better explain Particl’s story and mission, define its brand, and put the spotlight on the bigger picture (why we do what we do and why you need it). Additionally, SEO-friendly story contents help drive more traffic to the website.\n                        <br>\n                        <br>\n                            This initiative is currently in progress as we’ve started working with a few writers.

As part of the Particl reboot, we also thought of rebooting the Part-Time Show with it, only this time, differently. Leveraging the new interactive Clubhouse application, the new show will feature Dr. Kapil along with Joe Fisher, e-commerce expert.\n                        <br>\n                        <br>\n                            It will talk about a wide variety of topics related to Particl, including e-commerce, privacy, data security, decentralization, the impact of distributed networks on democracy, economics, censorship, and much more. While not a Particl-centric show itself, the new formula of the show is going to be much more dynamic. It intends on building relationships and initiating thoughtful discussions with people who understand the critical and modern issues of today’s society.\n                        <br>\n                        <br>\n                            Clubhouse can be defined as a mix between a podcast social media and LinkedIn.

If you have any marketing ideas or suggestions, feel free to reach out to the team to discuss them.</p><h2 id=\"basicswap-a-major-door-opener\">BasicSwap; A Major Door Opener</h2><p>When it comes to product-based marketing, we usually think about Particl Marketplace because it’s the project’s flagship application; a one-of-a-kind decentralized and private marketplace like none other. But shortly, a new Particl-made product with excellent marketing potential will go live in open beta: BasicSwap.</p><p>As you might know by now, BasicSwap is a cross-chain and private decentralized exchange that uses atomic swap and the SMSG network. It lets two users who don’t know each other safely exchange cryptocurrencies from two different blockchains. BasicSwap is set to become a crucial aspect of the Particl ecosystem and, at the same time, the project’s marketing strategy.</p><p>Incidentally, speculation is the most popular and widespread use case for cryptocurrencies. And as it becomes increasingly difficult and burdening to register and trade on centralized exchanges, many people are starting to look for decentralized solutions to suit their needs. As a result, the market share of decentralized marketplaces and the number of users grows every day. That’s an excellent opportunity for BasicSwap and the Particl project!</p><p>BasicSwap’s unique propositions, namely that it is cross-chain compatible, private, has order books, and supports Monero, are sure to turn some heads. BasicSwap is indeed set to generate adoption for the Particl ecosystem just on its own, independent of any marketplace activity. But, then, as it becomes an integrated part of Particl Desktop, its users are likely to bleed into other applications (i.e., Particl Marketplace), making them users of the Particl ecosystem as a whole rather than just one specific app. That’s the beauty of an all-inclusive decentralized ecosystem of apps and Particl's vision slowly coming to fruitition!</p><p>In other words, the addition of BasicSwap is much more than just a new useful app; it’s a massive load of marketing ammo both for itself and the broader Particl ecosystem. So expect marketing to be adapted as such and keep it in mind when you talk about Particl to other people.</p><h2 id=\"community-empowerment\">Community Empowerment</h2><p>The best marketing tool for any crypto project is the power of its community. That’s why we want to encourage community initiatives as much as possible with a new dedicated budget!</p><p>Do you have any marketing, outreach, or PR initiative that you’d like to lead? Then simply reach out to the team on Element, Discord, or Telegram with a written proposal explaining your project. If it gets approved, you’ll be asked to publish it on the <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io\">CCS</a>. Once your proposal is live, the team will then fund it using its dedicated community budget.</p><p>Publishing community-led marketing initiatives on CCS ensures the maximum level of transparency, lets others see what kind of efforts are ongoing, and helps determine what can people do to help. We highly encourage you all to participate; the more of us that spread the good word, the further it reaches!</p><blockquote><strong>Note 1: </strong><em>Keep in mind that we constantly receive many ideas with varying levels of detail. Before reaching out, make sure to think of all the details and write them down in your proposal. You also need to be able to lead that initiative yourself or delegate tasks on your own. The team can provide you with funding in PART and help you get started, but community-led initiatives are ultimately headed by whoever makes a proposal.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Note 2: </strong><em>If you have suggestions or marketing ideas you may not have the time to lead, don’t hesitate to contact the team regardless. We’ll determine whether the idea is viable and if it is possible to integrate it within our workflow.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"subscribe-to-our-newsletter\">Subscribe to our Newsletter</h2><p>If you haven’t already done so, we invite you to subscribe to our newsletter so that you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive content.

This\nweek, work has continued on the previously identified items. Additionally,\nfollowing feedback from some of the vendors on the marketplace, there's been a\nfair bit of investigation on listing fees and to determine how they could be\nlowered.\n\nFurthermore, a new update to BasicSwap has been pushed, bringing it closer than\never to its open beta phase (more details on that further down below).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Development Progress\nThis week has been a continuation of last week's list of items. \n\nTo provide a bit of clarity, the team is currently working on the Particl\nDesktop 3.1 (or V3.1) release, which focuses on fixing any bug or issue\nidentified since the launch of Particl V3. It also will include a few feature\nimprovements (i.e., the items mentioned in the list below).\n\nParticl Desktop 3.1 is a supporting update for the Particl V3 release and is not\nintended to introduce any new major feature or functionality; that is instead\nplanned for Particl Desktop 3.2 and onward. \n\nHere's the short-term to-do list for Particl Desktop 3.1.\n\n * Update Particl Desktop and particl-market (marketplace codebase) to use\n   Particl Core 0.21. This task is currently in progress and is expected to be\n   completed very shortly.\n * A number of features related to better vendor inventory import/update, which\n   includes the provision of a product code (allowing for updates to items via\n   CSV amongst other things), the ability to update pricing via the batch\n   publish window, and the ability to import images through the CSV file\n   directly (with the possibility to specify the category and target market\n   directly from the CSV coming soon as well). This task is currently in\n   progress.\n * The usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace to allow for\n   better, more customizable formatting. This task has already been started but\n   has been put on pause until the above items are completed. It is estimated\n   that this item will be completed very quickly once its development resumes.\n * Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address\n   requirement (i.e., download links, NFTs, user codes, etc.). This task has not\n   been started yet.\n\nParticl Core Development Progress\nAs we prepare the grounds for the launch of the open beta phase for BasicSwap, a\nnew version for it has been pushed to the closed beta group and requires further\ntesting. This new version introduces a few new features (i.e., private swap\noffers, where users can send private offers that can only be seen by one other\nparticular user) and improves on various functionalities. \n\nAfter the new Particl.io website goes live on Tuesday, you can expect an\nofficial BasicSwap introduction to be the next big piece of communications on\nParticl News. This blog post will explain everything you need to know about\nBasicSwap and officially announce it as the next big item coming up for Particl.\n\nOther than that, an SMSG update has been scheduled for an upcoming Particl\nhardfork. It fixes a case where adjusting markteplace listing fees through \nsmsgfeetarget was ineffective. Investigations on reducing listing fees are\nongoing and additional updates to that effect may be included for the next\nhardfork (no scheduled date at this time, we will inform you when that is the\ncase). \n\nNew Particl Website\nAs mentioned earlier in this update and in yesterday's marketing article, the\nnew Particl.io website is going to go live this coming Tuesday the 26th of\nOctober. Be sure to be around on that day to check it out!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you for your support and passion! You are what makes this project! \n\nBe sure to be around next week for the grand reveal of the new Particl website\nand share it far and wide with people you know will resonate with the project's\nmission.\n\nAnd on that note, we wish you all a great weekend.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est. July, 2025\n * Implementation: Upon successful vote (75% approval rate with minimum quorum\n   of 20% of the total supply over 10,080 blocks) and subsequent hard fork.\n\nImpact\nIf approved, this change will:\n\n * Significantly reduce PART's inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%;\n * Reduce PART’s inflation rate by 0.5% every year until it reaches 1.0%;\n * Remove the network treasury;\n * Initiate a hard fork of the Particl blockchain.\n\nWe believe this proposal represents a positive step toward optimizing the\nParticl network's economic model while ensuring sustainable project development\nand incentivising our community to actively promote and grow the\nnetwork.Important: For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are\nrunning its latest version.

I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system.

Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively targeting transformation into hard money.</strong></p><p>At present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget generated by:</p><ul><li>Network transaction fees</li><li>New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).</li></ul><p>Staking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active circulation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new tokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens minted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases - rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by<br>new token issuance (supply inflation).</p><p>In many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism of asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes that we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token for yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked will either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network grows.</p><p>Staking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not actively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity. Staking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value of circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however paradoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are essentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity that brings intrinsic value<br>to the network.</p><p>So if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed towards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully transform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?</p><p>Simple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the frequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively reducing new token issuance.</p><p>Fortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key applications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:</p><h3 id=\"basicswapdex-bsx-\">BasicSwapDex (BSX)</h3><ul><li>Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​</li><li>​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third party<br>integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap) with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</h3><ul><li>Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds utilised in purchasing goods and services.​</li><li>​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.</li></ul><p><strong>In any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development team and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl network otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time.</strong> They are effectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual supply inflation reward decreases.</p><p>I note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation rate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that result in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft currency.</p><p><strong>It is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus on increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability</strong> to create an L1 system whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to adequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful in that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with additional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money<br>than traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other cryptocurrencies currently traded today.</p><p>Regardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community is active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to further propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to 0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency funded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that satisfies my definition of “hard money”.</p><h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2><ul><li>Voting opens: Est.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies.
