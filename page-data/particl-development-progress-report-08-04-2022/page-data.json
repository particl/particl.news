This\nweek, we've got some exciting development on the side of Particl Desktop, with\nits new version finally nearing the beginning of the testnet round of testing!\n\nLet's jump right in and get into these details!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nThis week we've seen significant progress with the upcoming messaging system\nthat will be added to the marketplace. Dare we say that it is...right around the\ncorner? ?\n\nIn fact, it is now nearing completion, with the majority of the work in Particl\nDesktop being now completed. As it stands now, there are only a couple of issues\nthat still need to be addressed and one or two additional features that still\nneed to be implemented relating to the messaging. Still, those are minor\ncompared to the work that's already been done on that end.\n\nFor example, the ability to save a label, like a name or an identifier, to a\nparticular chat address still needs to be added to the desktop client; a feature\nthat should take no time to add. \n\nIn addition, there are still a couple of non-messaging issues that we've come\nacross that need to be looked at. By fixing these, along with the\nnow-quite-impressive number of improvements and bug fixes since our last desktop\nclient update, you can guess that Particl Desktop 3.2 is going to have a much\nbetter user experience and feel much smoother, especially for vendors who've\nsubmitted a non-negligible list of feedback, comments, and suggestions! Thank\nyou all for your constant reports; they help immensely in improving Particl!\n\nWith all of the above in mind, the focus for next week will be to complete all\nof the messaging-related changes (final desktop client implementation issues and\nfinal additional features) and do the final internal testing of the entirety of\nthe messaging implementation. We'll also strive to finish off the other\nnon-messaging issues. \n\nAnd so, we hope to be able to initiate the building process for Particl Desktop\n3.2 towards the end of next week or early into the following week. Regardless of\nwhen that process starts, expect a thorough update on the matter in next week's\nprogress report!\n\nParticl Core Progress Update\nThis week on Core, we've rebased the PartPayServer based on a request from a\npotential new partner to use the latest version of Particl Core. That means the\npayment server is now compatible with Taproot!\n\nFor those who don't know, PartPayServer is a payment module that can be\nintegrated into any website to accept both Bitcoin and Particl payments. The\npayment module can be integrated onto almost any website or platform or be added\nto any WooCommerce shop using the BtcPayServer plugin (cross-compatible with\nPartPayServer). \n\nIf you would like to accept Bitcoin or Particl payments on your website or\nonline shop (not hosted on Particl Marketplace), we recommend getting\nPartPayServer here [https://github.com/tecnovert/btcpayserver].\n\nGitHub - tecnovert/btcpayserver: Accept Bitcoin payments. Free, open-source &\nself-hosted, Bitcoin payment processor.Accept Bitcoin payments. Free,\nopen-source & self-hosted, Bitcoin payment processor. - GitHub -\ntecnovert/btcpayserver: Accept Bitcoin payments. Free, open-source &\nself-hosted, Bitcoin pa...GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/btcpayserver]You'll find all the required\ndocumentation on setting it up here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/btcpayserver/blob/master/README.md]. Additionally,\nif you want to install and run the WooCommerce plugin, refer to this document \nhere [https://docs.btcpayserver.org/WooCommerce/]. Although the documentation is\nmade for BtcPayServer, PartPayServer is completely cross-compatible with the\nplugin and will work without issue. Just make sure to enable the Separate\nPayment Gateways setting to accept PART and get to the api key from btcpayserver\nby going to: Account -> Manage account -> api keys. It's listed in the next\nsection after automatically setting up the api key. Finally, for this to work,\nyou'll need to set up your own store and wallets in PartPayServer.\n\nAside from this rebase, the rest of the focus has gone towards keeping the\nParticl codebase up-to-date with Particl Core, as is usual.\n\nBroadcasting Lower Market Listing Fees\nAs most of you know, the size of the Particl Marketplace listing fees is\ndependent on what the network wishes to see. Anyone who stakes PART can\nbroadcast their fee preferences and influence the rate with which the\nmarketplace bases its listing fees.\n\nSince the fee broadcasting feature was fixed and re-enabled on our last\nhardfork, the community has lowered listing fees significantly. Indeed, we've\nseen a 66.6% decrease in listing fees, going from a target fee rate of 20,767 to \n6,935 at the time of this writing. So how does that translate into real-world\ndata? Let's check it out.\n\nFor this example, let's assume a seller sells 100 items over 30 days. He\naverages three high-quality images and a reasonable description length in each\nlisting. Thus, this example assumes an SMSG message size of around 0.5 MB. In\ntotal, after a month's worth of listing with PART's value set at $0.80), the\nseller would have paid $83.22 in total. Note that because there is no sales fee\nor any other eCommerce-related fee on the platform, that is all the seller will\npay, regardless if sales are made or not. However, the fiat valuation of the\nlisting fee does change depending on the PART price.\n\nWith this data on hand, now you're in a better position to judge whether or not\nyou want to broadcast lower or higher fee target rates. If you'd like to change\nyour preferences, we invite you to read the blog post on the topic here\n[https://particl.news/adjusting-marketplace-listing-fees/] and change your\npreferences accordingly!\n\nAdjusting Marketplace Listing FeesAdjust the Particl Marketplace listing fees\nusing your staking power.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/adjusting-marketplace-listing-fees/]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

And\nboy has this week been a busy one with the release of several updates both to\nParticl Core and Particl Desktop.\n\nSo let's not waste any time and jump right into the crux of this update!‌\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Report\nThis week has been championed by the release of two very important updates to\nParticl Desktop [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-1-3-released/]. Indeed,\nan odd issue surfaced in which marketplace listings were not being received and\ndecrypted by other peers of the network. While this did not affect the sellers'\nability to publish listings, it caused products not to show up for other users\ncreating the illusion of an empty marketplace.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.1.3 ReleasedParticl Desktop 3.1.3 is now available and fixes\na\nmajor issue that prevented listings from being received, decrypted and\ndisplayed\nproperly on Particl Marketplace.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-1-3-released/]After relentless\ntroubleshooting and debugging with some of our current vendors, the root cause\nof the issue was identified and Particl's desktop developer Arnold Bansemer\npushed out a fix that resolves this issue.\n\nAlthough the Particl Desktop 3.1.2\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-1-2-released/] fixed a significant\nportion of this issue, the patch was later completed with the release of the \n3.1.3 [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-1-3-released/] versions which\nfully fixes the problem for good. Because this bug causes significant issues to\nthe marketplace's user experience (you can't see listings), this update is\nnecessary for anyone that wants to use Particl Marketplace.\n\nAnd so, although we hoped to be done this week with the in-market messaging\nsystem, the major issue mentioned just above created delays in its completion.\nWe can, however, report that it is almost complete by now. Once fully ready and\ninternally tested, we'll be ready to issue testnet builds for the Particl\ncommunity to test out the new major feature thoroughly.\n\nParticl Core Progress Update\nAs for Particl Core, this was a very busy and productive week as well. We've\nalso seen two releases for the two most popular Particl codebases; Particl Core\n0.19 and 0.21. ‌\n\nNew Particl Core Releases AvailableTwo new Particl Core releases (0.19.2.20 and\n0.21.2.8) are now available for download!Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/new-particl-core-releases-available/]These two releases\nfixed an array of bugs, notably one that prevented some anon outputs from being\nproperly displayed within the Coin Control menu. It also introduced a few\nimprovements like Particl's 0.19 codebase now having the same default ring size\nas all other maintained codebases as well as Particl Desktop. This improves the\nlevel of privacy of people making anon transactions using the 0.19 codebase by\nunifying the default value across all environments.\n\nNote that, since these two releases were in pre-release mode, Particl's cold\nstaking application doesn't automatically update to them yet. This is normal. In\nfact, ever since the release of 0.21.2.8 earlier this week, the build has been\nupdated to deal with a specific issue regarding peer selection and banning\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.21/doc/release-notes-particl.md#02128]\n. Since then, the 0.19.2.20 has been made into a full release, therefore,\nPartyman should be able to update.\n\nAdditionally, we released today, a new build in pre-release for Particl Core\n22.0 (note the change in nomenclature that comes with Bitcoin's latest codebase\nversion).\n\nRelease Particl Core 22.0.2 · particl/particl-coreRelease\nNotes:https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/22.x/doc/release-notes-particl.md#2202Hashesa4bbfa6322ec52272be567c39c54f543d2c06fb30827d5526c252c5c144f3d6c\nparticl-22.0.2.0-x86_64-l...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v22.0.2.0]Particl Core\n22.0.2 [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v22.0.2.0] \nintroduces a wide variety of improvements and bug fixes from Bitcoin's upstream\ncode, which can be seen by following this link\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/22.x/doc/release-notes-particl.md#2202]\n.

This week, we've had the pleasure of seeing the\nlong-anticipated release of Particl Electrum and have been making steady\nprogress on the various components that make our current primary focus.\n\nLet's get into the details right away!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nThis week regarding Particl Desktop, has seen its focus split into two fronts.\n\nOn the in-market messaging front, we're continuing to make progress on the inbox\nsystem. We're currently nearing completion of its integration into the ordering\nprocess (buy flow), and once that is complete, we'll start on its listing-based\nintegration.\n\nAside from work being done on the new messaging system, we've received a few\nissue and bug reports from some of the vendors currently operating on the\nmarketplace. This has led to the discovery of a couple of issues in the\nmarketplace codebase, as well as the addition of additional functionalities.\n\nFor this reason, we've seen a temporary decrease in the number of listings\ncurrently published on the marketplace as some of the sellers, some of which\nhave encountered similar issues, are waiting for them to be resolved before\nrelisting. In some cases, the changes can be made locally, and so we expect some\nmore listings to come back up even before the next release of Particl Desktop\n3.2.\n\nBasicSwap and Particl Core Progress Update\nThis week has seen the long-anticipated release of Particl Electrum, the light\nwallet which lets you manage your PART wallets without having to sync the entire\nblockchain. As such, two releases have been made this week with the second one\n[https://particl.news/particl-electrum-4-2-1-4-available/] adding the ability to\ncold stake funds stored on Electrum using Partyman as well as introducing the\nability to send funds to stealth (private) PART addresses.\n\nParticl Electrum 4.2.1.4 AvailableCold stake funds held on Particl Electrum\nusing Partyman and send funds to stealth addresses.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-electrum-4-2-1-4-available/]But as mentioned,\nmanaging funds through the Particl Electrum client is merely scratching the\nsurface of what we intend to do with it. Indeed, its back-end codebase provides\nlight services that can be used to make distributed applications more\naccessible. In Particl's case, it becomes notably useful for future web and\nlight releases of BasicSwap and the marketplace.\n\nAdditionally, large merges have been made from Bitcoin's upstream code into\nParticl Core. You can see a list of the most notable additions since the new\nParticl Core 23.0 update by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/blob/41d2a75f89f80ecc6ed35a642b83db0d61a9f44e/doc/release-notes-particl.md#next-major-version]\n. As always, these changes are critical to keep Particl's code as secure and\nmodern as possible.\n\nparticl-core/release-notes-particl.md at\n41d2a75f89f80ecc6ed35a642b83db0d61a9f44e · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core\nintegration/staging tree.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
