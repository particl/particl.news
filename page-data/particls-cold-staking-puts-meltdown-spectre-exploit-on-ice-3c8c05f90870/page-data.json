Dwarfed by funding raised by ICO projects and supported by\nour generous contributors, we reached all three milestones and our goal of\n$750,000 to support a focus team for 10 months for the development of Particl\nCore and the Particl Marketplace MVP.\n\nWhitepaper\nDeveloper Ido Kaiser presented the first draft of our marketplace in March 2017. \nhttps://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf\n\nParticl Foundation\nA crucial step prior to launching the PART blockchain was to create the Particl\nFoundation [https://particl.news/particl-foundation-is-approved-6cad0343e04f]. A \nnon-profit\n[https://www.moneyhouse.ch/en/company/particl-stiftung-7829033751/detail] \nlocated in Zug, Switzerland, the Foundation controls all the donations received\nin the token exchange and financially supports the development of Particl.\n\n> The foundation and its board will strictly function as an entity with the\nmission of providing funding and support for the Particl ecosystem, the\ncontinued development of the Particl network and academic, non-profit &\nfor-profit development of enhancements for the Particl platform and privacy\ndomain. The foundation will not govern nor make choices for the network itself,\nas the network will be governed in a decentralized manner by the native voting\nsystem directed by the network token holders themselves\nCurrency\nWhen Particl launched the PART token in July it was the only coin besides BTC\nand LTC running the latest secure code (0.14.2 at the time) and the first coin\nwith native SegWit (all transactions on Particl use segregated witness).\n\nOn top of Bitcoin, PART was also the first/only coin with Confidential\nTransactions (CT) privately blinding transactions amounts (breaking\ntraceability), and was the first/only coin with Ring Confidential Transactions\n(RingCT) allowing truly private transactions that privately obfuscate both\namounts and addresses (breaking traceability and linkability).\n\n> \nThe Particl development team launched PART with these “first in the industry”\nfeatures, day one… you’re welcome!\n\n> \nTo stop at the private, PART cryptocurrency was never in the cards for the team\nor our supportive community. The beginnings of an economy built on the\ndecentralized network effects of blockchain starts with a currency but in no way\nends there.\n\nFirst Steps\nSecurity\nThere is a responsibility put on a foundation/project to protect its userbase\nwith the latest security research/development offers. Rule 1: maintain the\ncodebase. Your codebase is your infrastructure, and in economics spending\ntime/money on infrastructure paves the way for growth and prosperity.\n\nThis year Bitcoin has updated its codebase 3\n[https://bitcoin.org/en/version-history] times since the launch of Particl. Our\nteam has merged those changes each time at a speed unmatched in the industry.\n\n * Bitcoin Core 0.15.1 (17.11.11)| Particl Core 0.15.1 (6 days later)\n * Bitcoin Core 0.15.0.1 (17.09.19)| Particl Core 0.15.0.2 (10 days later)\n * Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 (17.09.14) | Merged with above (15 days later)\n\nTo put this in perspective with other top cryptocurrency projects with Bitcoin\nas their codebase:\n\nPlease let me know if these codebase releases aren’t correct, I’ll fix np.It’s\nworth noting even straight forks of the Bitcoin blockchain this year aren’t\nbeing responsible to stay up-dated after the ceremony of splitting, gifting “\nfree [http://www.btcd.io/index.html#/]” coins to historical BTC addresses and\ninstant piggybacking on existing services\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/coinbase-adds-bitcoin-cash-offering-momentum-to-bitcoin-rival]\n.\n\nThe importance of fixing security breaches should be self evident in our\ntechnology dominated lives…\n\nThe above video is from the #BreakingBitcoin conference this year and this was\nthe controversial presentation given by Chris Jeffrey\n[https://twitter.com/_chjj] exposing a big permissions bug that was later fixed\nin Bitcoin 0.15 [https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.15.0]. All project codebases\nolder than protocol 0.15 are vulnerable to this bug and the farther away from\nthe latest code a project is the potentially harder it is to make fixes and\nprotect its users.\n\nTestnet\nThe moxie of a project can be gauged by their development community and testing\nenvironment. Before going live in July we opened up our open source code to\ntesters and developers in June\n[https://particl.news/particl-testnet2-is-now-live-e14b12301a14]. Thank you to\nall the people that helped prepare for our genesis block and successful launch!\n\nTwo of our most important developments started on testnet this year: RingCT and\nCold Staking (conditional staking). Cold Staking has since moved onto mainnet\nwhile RingCT is being reviewed with the help from researchers\n[http://cs.njit.edu/people/qiang-tang] at New Jersey Institute of Technology.\n\nThere’s no reason for Particl to not stay lock-n-step with Bitcoin researchers\nand developers throughout 2018 and beyond, and PART users should expect nothing\nless. Our privacy like CT & RingCT are enhancements to current protocol; making\nBitcoin private… no matter what project forks BTC blockchain next year making\nthe same claims ?\n\nLearning to Run\nWallets\nWith creating a top-tier privacy cryptocurrency in the books, our focus shifted\nto our other 2017 roadmap items that included tools to make PART use more mobile\nand user friendly. We built 4 [https://particl.wiki/particl-clients] wallets\nthis year for Particl users, specifically our Copay Wallet and our Electron\nParticl Wallet.\n\nhttps://github.com/particl/copay/releases/tag/v3.7.1.2The Particl team was the\nfirst crypto project this year to offer a Copay Wallet based off the open\nsource, HD‑multisignature wallet from BitPay [https://copay.io/].\n\nThe wallet [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.particl.copay] is\nlike a swiss-army knife for PART with the ability to have multiple wallets,\nshared wallets, multi-signature addresses and more.\n\nhttps://github.com/particl/partgui/releases/tag/v1.0.0Our Electron [https://electronjs.org/apps/particl] Particl Wallet is a\nfirst-of-its-kind wallet in the cryptocurrency space. Opting for a better user\nexperience and greater security, we moved away from the classic Bitcoin “Qt”\nwallet, instead building a full-blown WebEngine.\n\nThis approach allowed us to create a beautiful interface and a standardized API\nto build extensions upon. The team is using Angular [https://angular.io/] as the\nmain framework.\n\nUtility\n> “You’re supposed to use these coins to consume services like identity lookups or\ndecentralized DNS lookups but there is no platform to use these coins yet,” —\nDaniel Jeffries\n[https://hackernoon.com/mastering-shitcoins-the-poor-mans-guide-to-getting-crypto-rich-2e469b762ba9]\nMr. Jeffries rightfully identifies one of the pitfalls of crypto coins\n(currency) or in this case utility coins. 90% of crypto in the space this year\nare currency only coins that have no intrinsic value and are only as meaningful\nas the person buying on the other end.\n\nAgain, circling back to Particl’s vision of building a decentralized economy,\nevery decision we make is informed by this vision. Creating the currency was\nstep 1, creating a marketplace for people with cryptocurrency to be spent helps\nform an economy. A cycle of spending and earning provides utility on the\nblockchain.\n\nParticl Marketplace is scheduled for alpha [http://particl.io/roadmap/] release\nin Q1 of 2018. Work has been intense prepping the UI/UX and back-end\n[https://particl.news/particl-dev-update-particl-marketplace-64dbe7c2a5b9] as\n2017 came to an end.\n\nparticl/dapp-shell [https://github.com/particl/dapp-shell]\ndapp-shell - DApp Shell [https://github.com/particl/dapp-shell]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/dapp-shell]\n\nOpen Market Protocol (OMP)\nDeveloper Ido Kaiser had the pleasure of presenting at Hackers Congress\nParalelní Polis [https://liberate.hcpp.cz/#speakers] this year. One of the\npieces he shared was the development of our OMP specification for the platform.\n\nThe intent of this specification is to create a standardized and open format\nthat can encompass all the economic interactions of an online marketplace. It is\na good reference for the functions the team is building into Particl\nMarketplace.\n\nStacking on Muscle\nOk, in this review I’m about 3 months into our 6 months of being live on the\nblockchain. There’s no way we could do so much this year, so fast, without our\namazing global team!\n\nGrowth\nAt this time we’re approaching 20 people on the Particl Team. All team members\nare paid and 18 are full-time. The development team makes up the largest group\nwith 14 full-time developers, 1 part-time developer.\n\nCurrently, the team is optimally loaded more on the development side to deliver\nthe Particl Marketplace MVP as promised, Q1 2018. The marketing and\ncommunications team will be growing next to start 2018 as a big push for\ncommunity growth, awareness and adoption across the cryptocurrency landscape is\npriority #1 ahead of the markeplace release.\n\nHardfork / Cold Staking\nParticl had our first hardfork Nov.10th\n[https://particl.news/alert-particl-hardfork-nov-10th-4ca5b994017c], 2017. A\nplanned hardfork to activate Cold Staking, the community came through with\nspreading the word through creative graphics and viral tweets.\n\n❤️Atomic Swaps\nIn October, 2017 the Particl and Decred teams completed\n[https://github.com/decred/atomicswap/pull/29#event-1308087082] cross-chain\natomic swaps between both chains. We will continue to test and collaborate cross\nchain transactions with other projects. This is a big part of our vision for the \ncryptoagnostic Marketplace\n[http://www.investopedia.com/news/how-cryptocurrency-agnosticism-could-impact-industry/]\n.\n\nIntegrated: BTC, LTC, VTC, DCR\n\nSeeking Leaders/ Teachers\nWe began strategically laying out Particl and 2017’s critical path to deliver\nthe Particl Marketplace MVP with a strong, solid team of advisors that includes: \nMicah Spruill [https://linkedin.com/in/micahspruill], Joe Fisher, Yann Alleman\n[https://linkedin.com/in/yann-allemann-330bb727] and Arcanum.\n\nTapping into experience and expertise within the cryptocurrency space is always\nsomething Particl is searching for. As we move into 2018 and once Particl\nMarketplace is live the opportunities to engage other communities, developers\nand services multiplies tenfold.\n\nWe closed out 2017 with great additions to our team that increased our knowledge\nbase and strategic business connection possibilities.\n\nAdvisors\nCryptocurrency heavyweights Charlie Shrem, John Bailon and Miquel CunetaAdding\nadvisors like Charlie Shrem [https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlieshrem/], Miguel\nCuneta [https://www.linkedin.com/in/miguel-cuneta-a335b093/], John Bailon\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnbailon/] is the recipe for success that the\nParticl community and all crypto communities should be really excited about\nheading into 2018!\n\nResearch\nThe Foundation began November with a $35,000 donation to the New Jersey\nInstitute of Technology that gives us a focused team of students\n[https://web.njit.edu/~qiang/#student] and faculty lead by Assistant Professor \nQiang Tang [http://cs.njit.edu/people/qiang-tang].\n\nHis team will spend 6 months combing over privacy enhancements Particl has added\non top of Bitcoin such as Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT) and focused\nresearch surrounding decentralized marketplaces, privacy and user\nacquisition/localization strategies.\n\nProfessor Tang’s research interests lie in applied & theoretical cryptography,\nprivacy and computer security. In particular: blockchain technology,\npost-Snowden cryptography, accountability, and information theoretic security.\n\nBiggest Fans\nCommunity\nOur community has some heavy contributors\n[https://particl.news/particl-community-member-shoutout-1-d23912e6b9e5]. Closing\nout the year, more than 20 people contribute and add value to the Particl\nProject on a regularly basis in multiple disciplines. This number is steadily\ngrowing and the Particl team is honored and thankful to have their passion,\nvision and skills on their side.\n\nJoin the emerging Particl Community via our socialmedia\n[https://particl.wiki/socialmedia-channels] channels.\n\nOf note: Our Twitter [https://twitter.com/ParticlProject] page has surged past\n10.5k followers over the 2017 holiday season! ?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs 2017 comes to an end the entire team at Particl says “Thank You!”\nOur vision of building a decentralized, anonymous economy— where currency users\naren’t just moving coins from exchange to exchange but actually are owners of a\ndecentralized marketplace flowing through the network to actually spend and earn\nPART —has never wavered.\n\nHappy New Year!\nParticl Team","html":"<h3 id=\"thank-you-to-our-developers-community-and-team-\">Thank you to our developers, community and team!</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl--2017-Year-In-Review/1-MS0xX7_CO9kPtAtBsdIrdg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Particl blockchain was born in 2017, <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-launch-update-july-17th-2017-15ec6d4fd6a8\">July 17th</a>.

While Particl wasn’t listed in their research [lame], this logic is embedded in our vision:</p><blockquote>… to foster a fully independent, decentralized economy and provide a sustainable environment of collaboration and innovation that empowers peers across different blockchain projects while respecting their rights to freedom and privacy.</blockquote><p>It’s a mouthful, but key words in it —<em> decentralized, economy, collaboration, freedom, privacy</em> — affect every decision the team has made since day one and every decision going forward.</p><h2 id=\"first-days\">First Days</h2><h3 id=\"token-exchange\">Token exchange</h3><p>Prior to going live in July we held a successful <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-successfully-closes-out-its-seed-funding-round-highlighted-by-1658-participants-5-1-38dee90d1a91\">token exchange</a> (March/April 2017).

A <a href=\"https://www.moneyhouse.ch/en/company/particl-stiftung-7829033751/detail\">non-profit</a> located in Zug, Switzerland, the Foundation controls all the donations received in the token exchange and financially supports the development of Particl.</p><blockquote>The foundation and its board will strictly function as an entity with the mission of providing funding and support for the Particl ecosystem, the continued development of the Particl network and academic, non-profit &#x26; for-profit development of enhancements for the Particl platform and privacy domain. The foundation will not govern nor make choices for the network itself, as the network will be governed in a decentralized manner by the native voting system directed by the network token holders themselves</blockquote><h3 id=\"currency\">Currency</h3><p>When Particl launched the PART token in July it was the only coin besides BTC and LTC running the latest secure code (0.14.2 at the time) and the first coin with <strong>native</strong> SegWit (all transactions on Particl use segregated witness).</p><p>On top of Bitcoin, PART was also the first/only coin with Confidential Transactions (CT) privately blinding transactions amounts (breaking traceability), and was the first/only coin with Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT) allowing truly private transactions that privately obfuscate both amounts and addresses (breaking traceability <strong>and</strong> linkability).</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>The Particl development team <strong>launched</strong> PART with these “first in the industry” features, day one… you’re welcome!</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>To stop at the private, PART cryptocurrency was never in the cards for the team or our supportive community.
