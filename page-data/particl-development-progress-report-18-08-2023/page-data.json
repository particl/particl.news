Of course, being able to integrate the latter would\nimmediately make the integration of a number of stablecoins trivial, as many\nstablecoins already exist as ETH tokens.\n\nThese are some thoughts on what a PART(Anon)-ETH and XMR-ETH swap integration\ninto a comprehensive DEX framework like BasicSwap could look like.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Existing XMR-ETH Swap\n\nPeople who had the pleasure to witness Elizabeth Bink [https://github.com/noot]\n’s Monerotopia presentation on XMR-ETH swaps may have developed a curiosity\ntowards hyper-private Ethereum swaps and what they entail, perhaps most\nimportantly in the hopes of facilitating untraceable, decentralized swaps\nbetween privacy coins and stablecoins (or simply ETH itself).\n\nElizabeth and the open source project AthanorLabs\n[https://github.com/AthanorLabs/atomic-swap] achieved the first XMR-ETH atomic\nswap earlier this year, and presented it to the world at the Monerotopia\nconference in Mexico City, on May 6th. Using their own breakthrough protocol,\nAthanor was able to deal with the unique limitations that both XMR and ETH bring\nto the table, to achieve for the first time a bona fide atomic swap between the\ntwo currencies. And while there are some code-related hurdles and considerations\nto integrate her swap into the BasicSwap environment, *how* her ETH-XMR swap\nworks and what it reveals about the peculiarities of Ethereum is significantly\nmore interesting for our purposes.\n\nUnder The Hood\nXMR, of course, and as we’ve discussed at length\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n, has no scripting language. For that reason, the classic HTLC swap\n[https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/], where both coins need some\nbasic smart contract capabilities, is out of contention.\n\nETH considerations are of an entirely different order. It could seem to people\nfamiliar with the semi-scriptless adaptor signature protocol\n[https://medium.com/crypto-garage/adaptor-signature-schnorr-signature-and-ecdsa-da0663c2adc4] \nthat the highly scriptable Ethereum would satisfy all possible requirements that\nthe “script side” of the ECDSA adaptor signature scheme entails; however, as\nalways, the devil is in the details.\n\nAs it happens, the adaptor signature swap, or at least the semi-scriptless\nadaptor signature scheme that was designed to work with ECDSA curves, is as of\ntoday fundamentally incompatible with Ethereum. The reason, as it turns out, is\nthat Ethereum is account-based\n[https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/], and not UTXO-based.\n\nThe Challenges of an Account-based Architecture\nIn short, when a transaction is initiated in this model, it prompts nodes to\ndecrease the sender's account balance and increase the receiver's account\nbalance accordingly. To safeguard against replay attacks in account-based\ntransaction models, each transaction is associated with a unique nonce\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonce.asp]. To that end, the nonce is\npublicly visible and intrinsically linked to a transaction. This ensures that\nthe same transaction cannot be submitted more than once.\n\nThis breaks the adaptor signature scheme. The adaptor signature model requires\nrefund transactions to be pre-signed; but for ethereum, you cannot pre-sign a\ntransaction without knowing the nonce. Due to this, one of the parties could\nthen send a transaction in between the moment when the pre-signing was done and\nwhen the transaction was executed - which would invalidate the pre-signed\ntransaction (as the nonce was already used, and cannot be used twice).\n\nPre-signing in adaptor signature swapsAthanorLab's solution is to make use of\nEthereum smart contracts themselves, in order to support the entirety of the\nswap without adaptor signature logic. It is, in that sense, also semi-scriptless\n- but whereas the elegant and impenetrable adaptor signature carries the\nnecessary logic to achieve the XMR swap, the ETH swap counterpart is carried by\nthe powerful capabilities of Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nPrivacy-wise, this means the anonymity set of the ETH swap is stronger than HTLC\n(where contracts can be found on both sides of the swap), but less so than\nadaptor signatures, due to the need for a public contract on one side. On the\nside without a contract, a swap transaction looks the same as any other\ntransaction. But on the side with the contract, while it is evident that the\ntransaction is for a swap, it is impossible to trace it to the other chain, even\nwith sophisticated chain analysis tools.\n\nSo, while BasicSwap has under its belt the GUI, order book and all the internal\nlogic needed to propagate and make available atomic swap trades of all kinds —\nincluding Ethereum — the two types of swaps it currently supports are both\ninadequate for Ethereum swaps. Such a feat, while conceivable, will require a\nfull integration of Elizabeth’s protocol, or a similar protocol, into BasicSwap.\n\nA snapshot of BasicSwap's orderbook GUI, powered by the SMSG networkCurrent\nProtocol Limitations\nAn important setback of ETH-RingCT swaps, as the protocol stands right now, is\nthat ETH providers are not able to publish offers they're willing to engage in.\nThat means that, like the adaptor signature swap that had a similar issue, only\none side can publish trades - in this case, the RingCT side. \n\nThe RingCT side, in this case XMR, has no scripting, and thus no way to refund\nin case the counterparty backs out – whereas for ETH, if the ETH-holder locks\nfirst, they can refund if the XMR-holder backs out. However, if the XMR-holder\nlocks first and the ETH-holder only then backs out, then their funds are locked\nforever. This means that the swap itself always has to be structured in one way,\nwith XMR as the initial offerer, similar to how adaptor signature swaps work at\nthe protocol level.\n\nAnother underlying issue here, and the reason why ETH holders cannot even\nadvertise offers for entering into a swap, is because of the gas fees of the\nEthereum contract itself. Gas fees, of course, should be expected to be provided\nfor by the ETH side of the transaction, and not the XMR side. This is another\nreason why the XMR-holder must initiate the swap, as the cost for the ETH-holder\nto lock is significantly higher than for the XMR-holder – the former could\neasily be griefed if someone repeatedly were to take an advertised offer, or\nmultiple offers, and back out.\n\nThis unidirectional restriction is problematic: the offerer dictates the swap's\nparameters, including the offered and requested coins, their respective\nquantities, and the exchange rate. That means ETH holders, in this context, have\nlittle say on the parameters of any given swap, and are subject to the\npreferences of XMR holders to achieve a swap. \n\nAthanorLab's XMR-ETH swap current command-line interfaceLooking Ahead\nMuch like was done with the XMR-BTC swap, BasicSwap's intention is to leverage\nthe SMSG network in order to assess the current limitations of the proposed\nXMR-ETH swap protocol.\n\nBidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) Atomic Swaps Now Live on BasicSwap DEX\nBidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) atomic swaps now live on BasicSwap DEX.\nParticl NewsCangrejo\n[https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\nRemember, our solution to achieve bidirectionality for XMR-BTC atomic swaps\ndidn't hinge on modifying the Monero codebase or its adaptor signature atomic\nswap protocol. Instead, we leveraged the SMSG network to simulate offers\nfeaturing Monero\n[https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n. In reality, BasicSwap still employs the same semi-scriptless protocol — hence,\nat the protocol level, the swap remains unidirectional. However, by integrating\nan additional automated step into the swap process — powered by the SMSG network\n— we've made it appear as if Monero can now be offered.\n\nEven though it is fundamentally a clever workaround, essentially providing the \nillusion of a truly bidirectional swap, it is entirely seamless for the end user\nand doesn't necessitate any additional manual input or requirements.\n\nThis is all very exciting — the presence of ETH tokens would certainly prove a\npowerful addition to the BasicSwap ecosystem, and eventually to the Particl\nMarketplace, as it would open decentralized commerce to the entire Ethereum\necosystem. Furthermore, although a lot of work and testing are still ahead\nbefore this becomes a reality, the unique interaction of atomic swaps and\nBasicSwap's decentralized orderbook could once again prove to be key in\nachieving bidirectional swaps for a semi-scriptless protocol with substantial\nlimitations.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you wish to look into the ETH-XMR Atomic Swap protocol in more technical\ndetail, you can check out the project's Github\n[https://github.com/AthanorLabs/atomic-swap]\n[https://github.com/AthanorLabs/atomic-swap] or join their Element room\n[https://matrix.to/#/#ethxmrswap:matrix.org]. \n\nThe protocol is still in its early phases, having been out to the public for\nslightly more than 3 months, and they would certainly welcome knowledgeable beta\ntesters and people willing to contribute end relays to this ongoing experiment!\nThe project is open source and at the forefront of atomic swap technology, and\nevery little bit helps.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you would like to deepen your understanding of atomic swaps and their\nhistory, make sure to give these articles a read!\n\n * Atomic Swap Style Showdown [https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/]\n * The DEX Revolution Pt. 1\n   [https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n * The DEX Revolution Pt. 2\n   [https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-basicswap-and-web-access-considerations/]\n * Bidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) Atomic Swaps\n   [https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

Using their own breakthrough protocol, Athanor was able to deal with the unique limitations that both XMR and ETH bring to the table, to achieve for the first time a <em>bona fide </em>atomic swap between the two currencies. And while there are some code-related hurdles and considerations to integrate her swap into the BasicSwap environment, *how* her ETH-XMR swap works and what it reveals about the peculiarities of Ethereum is significantly more interesting for our purposes.</p><h3 id=\"under-the-hood\">Under The Hood</h3><p>XMR, of course, and <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/\">as we’ve discussed at length</a>, has no scripting language. For that reason, the classic <a href=\"https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/\">HTLC swap</a>, where both coins need some basic smart contract capabilities, is out of contention.</p><p>ETH considerations are of an entirely different order. It could seem to people familiar with the <a href=\"https://medium.com/crypto-garage/adaptor-signature-schnorr-signature-and-ecdsa-da0663c2adc4\">semi-scriptless adaptor signature protocol</a> that the highly scriptable Ethereum would satisfy all possible requirements that the “script side” of the ECDSA adaptor signature scheme entails; however, as always, the devil is in the details.</p><p>As it happens, the adaptor signature swap, or at least the semi-scriptless adaptor signature scheme that was designed to work with ECDSA curves, is as of today fundamentally incompatible with Ethereum. The reason, as it turns out, is that Ethereum is <strong><a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/\">account-based</a>,</strong> and not UTXO-based.</p><h3 id=\"the-challenges-of-an-account-based-architecture\">The Challenges of an Account-based Architecture</h3><p>In short, when a transaction is initiated in this model, it prompts nodes to decrease the sender's account balance and increase the receiver's account balance accordingly. To safeguard against replay attacks in account-based transaction models, each transaction is associated with a unique <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonce.asp\">nonce</a>.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
