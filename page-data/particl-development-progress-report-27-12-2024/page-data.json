look back at what\nwe've achieved in the past few days and see what we've got to look forward to in\nthe week to come.\n\nNote that last week's progress was slightly slower than usual due to the\nholidays and spending a few days with family and friends. Regular development\npace has now resumed.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nDogecoin Integration ?\nWe are ready to merge the Dogecoin (DOGE) integration into the dev branch for\ncommunity testing, which will occur within the next few hours or during the\nweekend.\n\nDue to Dogecoin's unique codebase, we've developed a custom core package to\nenable integration. We're seeking additional community testers to thoroughly\nevaluate this implementation before its production release. It's important to\nnote that this DOGE integration will be classified as 'experimental' since it\nuses our custom core rather than the official one. This custom version was\nnecessary to implement functions required by BasicSwap that are absent from the\nofficial core.\n\nFurthermore, due to Dogecoin's lack of SegWit support, it will only be available\nas a scriptless coin. This means it cannot be swapped directly with Monero,\nWownero, or other non-scriptable coins. While we're investigating potential\nsolutions to this limitation, implementing the necessary changes may ultimately\ndepend on the Dogecoin development team.\n\nPrivate Offers  ?\nWe're expanding the local reputation system announced in last week's update with\nmore user-friendly features. These include a new tagging system that color-codes\nSMSG ID addresses on the order book and replaces them with user-defined labels\nwhen saved in contacts. We're also developing an improved identity page that\nfunctions more like a contact management system, making identity handling more\nintuitive.\n\nAlso, planning has begun for our network-wide reputation system, which will\nadapt much of the local reputation logic but operate at the node level. While\nimplementing decentralized reputation presents significant challenges, we've\ndesigned an elegant solution. However, it requires additional refinement to\naddress potential vulnerabilities.\n\nThough implementation isn't immediate, this network-wide reputation system\nrepresents one of our next major developments for BasicSwap. We'll provide more\ndetailed information once we begin active development.\n\nMaster Update ✅\nWe're preparing for the next BasicSwap production update, scheduled for release\naround next week. In preparation, we're completing various smaller tasks from\nour development list and will dedicate the next few days to minor bug fixes and\nimprovements.\n\nWatch for an upcoming Particl News blog post that will detail all the new\nfeatures and improvements in this update!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nDogecoin Integration ?\nWe are in the final stages of the DOGE integration, with only a few remaining\nadditions to complete.\n\nWe're still testing the various components of this integration to ensure they\nbehave as expected in all cases, but we are now indeed in the final stage of the\nprocess.\n\nPrivate Offers  ?\nWe're completing development of a new GUI feature that enables private trading\ncapabilities — a functionality that has been available in the back-end for some\ntime but lacked an intuitive user interface.\n\nPrivate Offers (WIP)Private offers are coming to BasicSwap DEX, allowing users\nto publish offers visible only to specifically authorized parties. These offers\nwill appear in the authorized users' order books with a private tag, indicating\ntheir exclusive nature.\n\nThis feature will soon be available in the dev branch, and we'll provide updates\nas development progresses.\"\n\nWebsockets for Live Updates ?\nWe have completed the integration of websockets into BasicSwap, enabling instant\norder book updates rather than relying on timed refreshes.\n\nThis improvement is crucial as we move toward making BasicSwap's order book more\ndynamic and visually similar to centralized exchanges, with buy/sell side splits\nand depth chart functionality.\n\nUser Interface  ?️\nAdditionally, we continue to make progress on following items outlined\npreviously:\n\n * Development of a new \"quick swap\" page\n   [https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-06-12-2024/#quick-swaps-] \n   that allows users to more easily and accurately swap cryptocurrencies\n * Implementing server-side caching for rate and percentage calculations (in\n   progress, experimental)\n * Standardized modal system; replacing JavaScript popups with consistent,\n   global modal components\n * Various other tweaks and improvements\n\nBasicSwap and Particl in the Media ?️\nPrivacy Roundtable w/ Rachel Rose O'Leary ?️\nThis week's Privacy Roundtable featured a special discussion with Rachel-Rose\nO'Leary from Lunar Punk, joined by our friends from PIVX and Firo. If you missed\nthe live broadcast, you can watch the full episode at the link below.\n\nx.comX (formerly Twitter) [https://x.com/firoorg/status/1869380929896194489]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
