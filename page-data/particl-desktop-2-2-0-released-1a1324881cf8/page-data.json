This update brings one of most awaited feature\nsince the Open Marketplace’s mainnet launch on the 12th of August— bid\ncancellation.\n\nPrior to Particl Desktop 2.2.0, it was possible, but not user-friendly, to\ncancel a bid/order up until the seller either accepted or rejected it. This led\nto situations where buyers would need to wait a long time, or some “advanced\nParticl knowledge”, until they could access their funds again. This update fixes\nthat issue entirely by making it possible for both parties to cancel a bid/order\nat any time up until the moment both party’s funds are fully locked in escrow.\n\nWallet-Specific Settings PageThis Particl Desktop update also brings forward the\nnew Settings page. It can be accessed by clicking the Settings icon at the\nbottom left corner of the client.\n\nThe Settings page lets you control some preferences right from the Particl\nDesktop client and without having to manually edit configuration files.

Woods is\na veteran with more than 18 years of experience in the technical and payment\nindustries. He brings extensive expertise and reach within the retail and\nconsumer markets and will pro-actively work in bridging the gap between the\ntraditional finance sector and cryptocurrency.\n\nMr. Woods will advise Particl on the opportunities to disrupt the fintech\nindustry that are currently being opened up by distributed technologies and how\nbest to capitalize on them. In addition, Woods will actively work on realizing\nthese opportunities by tapping right into his vast network of merchants and\nbusinesses and connect them with Particl for its world-class technologies and\ndecentralized services.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Case for Connecting Fintech Businesses to Particl\nMany businesses, like tech companies operating outside the cryptocurrency\nindustry but actively looking to modernize and optimize their business flow, can\nbenefit from Particl’s range of decentralized services. For example, a business\nmay simply want to accept cryptocurrency payments, but another may also need to\ntransfer data securely and privately, without third-party custody of the data.\nIn that case, they could use Particl’s peer-to-peer data storage network called\nSMSG and integrate it into their model.\n\nOnline retailers, who constantly need to lower their costs or worry about the\nprivacy and security of their data may want to open shop and sell products on\nParticl’s decentralized and private-by-default marketplace. After all, it\ncharges no commission! Other companies may only have a need for Particl’s double\ndeposit escrow system to keep certain parties in check with each other.\n\n> “Through his many years working right in the heart of the payment industry,\nBryan has developed lasting relationships with many businesses that are\ncurrently looking for ways to implement distributed technologies.Bryan will be\nworking closely with Particl to advise on the exact needs and requirements of\nthese companies and actively help onboarding them with Particl’s wide array of\ndecentralized services.” —Gerlof van Ek, Co-Founder at Particl\n\nIn fact, most businesses have surprisingly high levels of inefficiencies. This\ncosts them profits, time, and opportunities. Some of these hurdles are caused by\nhuman activity, regulations, politics, but some of them are also caused by\ntechnological bottlenecks. Coincidentally, it appears that more and more\nbusinesses realize the potential that distributed technologies present (P2P,\nblockchain). Of course, most of them would never dare, nor need to, go “full\ncrypto”, but just the right amount of distributed technology at the right place\nwithin their operations can make all the difference.\n\nThis shift of mentality within the traditional finance industry is opening up a\nlot of doors, and this is the opportunity that Bryan Woods wants to seize, with\nParticl.\n\n> Note: While Particl has already met and been introduced to some businesses\nwithin Bryan’s network, it may still take some time until the first few\nimplementations are ready and deployed. It is not impossible that the first few\ndeployments will occur in early 2020, as opposed to 2019. As always, follow\nParticl.news to not miss any update!\nLeveraging Spend.com’s Technology\nThe coming of Bryan as an advisor also opens up many interplay opportunities\nbetween both Spend and Particl’s ecosystems.\n\nSpend is a next-generation banking ecosystem with tens of thousands of active\nusers. It acts as a fiat gateway and “banking services 2.0\" provider. Its\nall-in-one mobile application allows you to hold, transfer, deposit, and\nwithdraw multiple cryptocurrencies and fiat (currently only USD and CAD) without\nrequiring a bank. Spend also makes spending very easy through its different\nSpend Visa payment card options that automatically and instantly converts any\ncurrency enabled for card payments into the currency requested by the merchant.\nFurther down the line, it is also intended for Spend App to include many other\nservices, such as loans, interest, and even a full-blown merchant or marketplace\nintegration. The end goal for Spend is to keep all the financial activities of\nits users within the Spend App itself. Think of it as the ultimate banking\napplication.\n\nIn addition to connecting Particl and other businesses together, Bryan and his\nteam at Spend will actively explore, along with the Particl team, how both\nprojects can synergize together to push the adoption of distributed technologies\nand cryptocurrencies to a wider audience.\n\nOn one hand, Spend.com offers a full suite of gateway and payment services that\ncan help onboard people to the Particl platform much more effectively. These\nservices include the near-instant and cost-effective swap of currencies, fiat on\nand off-ramps, Visa payment cards, and etc.\n\nOn the other hand, the multiple decentralized services produced by the Particl\nteam can allow Spend’s ecosystem to blossom into a powerful application that\nseamlessly combines the traditional banking industry and distributed\ntechnologies, making the adoption of new users into alternative banking and\ncryptocurrencies much easier than ever.\n\nA Methodical & Strategic Approach to Increasing Particl’s Stability\nBy integrating Particl’s decentralized services into other businesses, an\nincreased number of transactions is expected to occur on the native Particl\nblockchain and on the markets, providing the entire network and its various\napplications (i.e. Particl’s decentralized marketplace) with more privacy,\nliquidity, and stability.\n\nIt is important to highlight that this new strategic relationship between Bryan\nWoods and the Particl team marks the official beginning of a long-term and very\nstrategic play to take the banking and eCommerce worlds through the next\nevolutionary hop. As a result, to ensure the trading markets can absorb the new\ninflux of activity caused by businesses integrating Particl services,\nintegrations will be deployed methodically, one by one, in a way that ensures\nmarket stability. Over time, each added integration will contribute to\nincreasing the overall liquidity of the markets, making it easier to deploy more\nintegrations and more services at a much faster pace.\n\nParticl’s First Few Steps Towards a Comprehensive SDK\nFor Particl, this phase also marks a very important milestone. These are the\nfirst few steps towards building and packaging a comprehensive developer SDK. \nThe process of building integrations for third-parties will give the team a\nbrand new perspective on what components are the most critical for developers\nlooking forward to using a Particl SDK and will considerably speed up the\nprocess of finalizing and releasing it. In a way, the team will have to go\nthrough some of the same steps developers will go through when using the SDK, so\nhighlighting needs and issues should be much quicker.\n\nSuch integrations will demonstrate that with a bit of creativity, blockchain\ntechnology and cryptocurrencies can offer very practical and disruptive\nsolutions to some of the most pressing issues present within the traditional\nbanking, payment, and eCommerce systems.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout Bryan Woods\n> Bryan has more than 18 years of experience in the technical and payment\nindustries.

As you probably already know, the team initiated its \nParticl World Tour [https://particl.news/particl-world-tour-2019-f6e3d3c7e09c] \nby first going to the United States and attend 3 different conferences —\nMoney2020 [https://us.money2020.com/], WCC [https://worldcryptocon.com/], and \nSFBW’s Epicenter [https://sfblockchainweek.io/].\n\nIt’s safe to say that, throughout this first part of the Particl World Tour, the\nteam has made tremendous progress on all fronts and has been able to collect a\nsignificant amount of feedback, advice, contacts, and most importantly, new\nfriends taking part, just like the team, in this ambitious blockchain journey!\nAlong the way, Particl met with tech evangelists, developers, capital funds,\nbusiness owners, market makers, innovators, and was even able to scoop a new\nadvisor [https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190348538498019329], Bryan\nWoods [https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-woods-3243a1167] (Spend.com\n[https://spend.com]’s President) to assist and support the project in making the\nbest out of the many opportunities currently opening up within the payment and\neCommerce industries. The team had the blessing of being accompanied, for most\nof the trip, by Crypto PR Lab, a San Francisco-based PR firm that has grown\ncloser to the team ever since meeting for the first time at Consensus 2019.\nTheir insight, reach, and contacts within the local SF blockchain community have\nproven to be an invaluable asset for the entire duration of the trip.\n\nFor this first part of the Particl World Tour, the team split into different\ngroups and spread out on the US West Coast (San Francisco & Las Vegas) to cover\nmultiple events and maximize results. This strategy allowed to cover a lot of\nground at once and has brought very valuable connections that could then be best\nleveraged by the fact that the whole team ended up meeting as one for SFBW’s\nEpicenter. It doesn’t happen all the time that so many team members get to meet,\nin-person, and so the strategy was to optimize this precious opportunity and get\nthe most done out of it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSan Francisco\nWhile a portion of the team was in Vegas for Money2020 and WCC, another portion\nwas already in San Francisco for the start of the San Francisco Blockchain Week.\nEpicenter, the week’s main and last event, is where Particl held a booth for two\ndays as well as a 30-minute talk. But in no way was it the only event of\ninterest!\n\nThe city was literally buzzing about blockchain and the many events attracted\nthe entirety of the local, but very front running, San Francisco-based\ncryptocurrency community. It really felt home! Let’s not forget San Francisco\nand the Bay Area, in general, is the homeland of startups and the heart of the\ntech industry. People from all around the world join together with the hopes of\ncreating the next new groundbreaking technology or project. Particl fits very\nmuch within that innovation-focused and very forward-thinking mindset.\n\nSFBW’s particular type of schedule (having the main event at the very end of the\nweek) proved to be an excellent opportunity for the team to initiate the first\npoints of contact with multiple key people by attending many of the side-events\nand evening receptions organized all throughout the week. Then, during the two\ndays of Epicenter, came the opportunities to capitalize on these contacts made\nduring the week by demonstrating the marketplace and have more quality time with\nthese people.\n\nBefore Epicenter, the Particl team attended CESC, the San Francisco Blockchain\nWeek’s kickoff event where it set up a table at the location to improvise a\nquick Particl booth with a couple of computers running the Open Marketplace. As\nis now usual, the marketplace really impressed and gained great reactions and\ninterest which brought new pairs of eyes on Particl and made new friends around,\nlike the stand-up guys over at Cracking Crypto\n[https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto],\n[https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto] for example.\n\nDr. Kap Giving an Interview to the Cracking Crypto ShowThe team also attended\nmore than a dozen side-events (most of the time, many a night…who needs sleep?)\nall throughout the week such as receptions organized by Polychain Capital,\nPantera Capital, Outliers Ventures, Starfish Network, eToro, Huobi, OceanEx, and\nmore. The connections established at all these events really did set the state\nfor when everybody would be crossing paths again later at Epicenter.\n\nLas Vegas\nAnd so while a portion of the team was in San Francisco for the start of SFBW,\nJoe Fisher and Cryptoguard were in Las Vegas, to attend Money2020\n[https://us.money2020.com/] and the World Crypto Conference (WCC)\n[https://worldcryptocon.com/].\n\nParticl Welcomes Bryan Woods, Spend.com’s President, as New AdvisorAt Money2020 [https://us.money2020.com/], a Fintech conference focused on\ninnovations within the payment industry, the focus was entirely on sealing the\ndeal with a new advisor, Bryan Woods, President at Spend.com. Spend.com is a\nteam that has been growing closer to the Particl team ever since meeting at the\nConsensus 2019 booth in New York City.\n\nThe Particl team spent 2 full days working at Spend.com’s booth (one of the big\nsponsors of Money2020) to discuss and work on various strategies moving into\n2020. This is a direct follow-up to another in-person trip the team made earlier\nin October 2019 to meet up with Spend.com. Meeting once again, at Money2020,\nallowed both teams to initiate and walk the first steps of a long-term\nrelationship together. More details will follow this coming Thursday in a blog\npost published on Particl.news. Definitely stay tuned!\n\nSpecial shoutout to Nicholas Merten [https://twitter.com/Nicholas_Merten], aka \nDataDash [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCatR7nWbYrkVXdxXb4cGXw], which the\nteam had the pleasure to cross paths with at Money2020. His focus, dedication,\nand projects to help cryptocurrencies move further along the path to mainstream\nadoption really impressed!\n\nNicholas Merten, aka Datadash, hanging out with ParticlThen, after Money2020,\nCryptoguard flew to join the rest of the team in San Francisco while Joe Fisher\nstayed an additional day in Vegas to take part in the WCC conference\n[https://worldcryptocon.com/].\n\nWCC was the perfect occasion to meet with some of the people the team had been\nlooking forward to meetup with again and yet another quality event to make the\nfirst points of contact with various people. Indeed, just like SFBW, WCC\nattracted a quality crowd as well as many leaders within the blockchain\nindustry, some of which couldn’t make it to SFBW. In that scenario, splitting\nthe team into two different cities really reaped a lot of benefits for Particl.\n\nJoe Fisher and Masha Prusakova at WCC 2019Epicenter — SFBW’s Main Event\nAnd then came Epicenter [https://sfblockchainweek.io/], the main event of the\nSan Francisco Blockchain Week. The Particl team all met as one the day before\nand came to the conference as a gold sponsor, had a booth right next to the main\nentrance, and gave a 30-minute talk on the Industry Stage.\n\nParticl Team Showing Off the Open Marketplace at SFBW’s EpicenterJust like\nthroughout the first part of the week, the reactions at the booth were\noverwhelmingly good and, maybe strangely enough, people still looked surprised\nthat a fully decentralized and no compromise blockchain project is already live\nand looking so good, even to this day. This is the typical feedback Particl has\nbeen receiving ever since it started going to more events this year.\n\nEpicenter’s crowd was definitely smaller than Consensus, but it was much more\nfocused and in “business mode”. The reason for this is actually important to\nunderstand. The people who still remain in blockchain after a more than\ntwo-year-long bear market and keep attending these kinds of events are the true\npioneers that will propel the next blockchain wave. They are the people fighting\nin the trenches, against all odds, to make sure the blockchain revolution will\none day catch up on the mainstream level.\n\nAnd in San Francisco, of all places, a place renowned for how many tech\ninnovations it generates every year. The people attending these conferences\ndon’t look at the industry with a narrow-minded view. No, they instead know the\nlong-term potential of these groundbreaking technologies and are the ones that\nare making it happen.\n\nThis is actually the main reason Particl wanted to attend SFBW. The team knew\nthe potential of this local blockchain community, thanks in part to attending\nthe SF-based Bitcoin2019\n[https://particl.news/particl-in-san-francisco-bitcoin2019-571fe31fe396] \nconference earlier in the year, and knew it would be a perfectly receptive and\nexcited crowd.\n\n, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman at Blockchain Research InstituteAnd the team\nwas right! Particl had the opportunity to spend some high-quality time with\nthought leaders and experts from many different industries and received many\nadvice and resources. For example, the Particl team had the chance to meet with \nDon Tapscott, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman at Blockchain Research Institute\n[https://www.blockchainresearchinstitute.org/], and earn 30 minutes of his time\njust before flying out to Europe.\n\nIndeed, just like with Don Tapscott, many similar breakout meetings, sit-downs,\nand evening-long discussions happened with several key people working on pushing\nblockchain forward. The team met with media, capital firms, lawyers, developers,\nbusiness developers, the inventor of eGift cards, and even a guy that can solve\na Rubics cube blindfolded, but more importantly, made many new friends on the\nway that are as passionate and dedicated to see cryptocurrencies succeed.\n\nThe team also had a 30-minute speaking slot on the Industry Stage and sent Dr.\nKap on stage. Some of the people the team has met throughout the week attended\nthe talk which further helped them understand the project’s vision and\nintentions. The official presentation video will be published within a few days\nby the SFBW organizers. In the meantime, you can check out Dr. Kap’s\npresentation on Particl’s Youtube channel.\n\n> The upload originally is a Periscope\n[https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB] \n[https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB]video\n[https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB] taken by Particl’s Community\nManager, Guillaume Benayoun. You can check out more video of the team in San\nFrancisco by browsing Ben’s Periscope uploads here: \nhttps://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1jMJgwZoNjWJL?t=1s\nThe team used the exposure and momentum provided by a full week of intensive\nnetworking to announce to major pieces of news that will help propel the project\nforward —an in-wallet integration of a Bitcoin exchange module\n[https://particl.news/particl-announces-bitcoin-exchange-integration-into-particl-desktop-e7c0940c0b4d] \nand the official beginning of an intimate and long-term relationship with\nSpend.com [https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190348538498019329]. Bryan\nWoods, Spend.com’s President, was announced at the same time as a new advisor to\nthe project.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTakeaways\nThink of this whole US West Coast trip as a giant, never-ending brainstorming\nsession with not only team members, but advisors, leaders, and experts from many\ndifferent industries hungry to see any solid blockchain tech succeed.\n\nThe Particl Team Debriefing Post-SFBWThe people the team met get it. They get\nthe potential of blockchain and Particl both. They want to see the industry\nsucceed and the products powered by blockchain land in the hands of everyday\npeople.\n\nWhile the team already knew about the quality of the Particl platform, it is now\ncrystal clear from all the feedback received that the Particl ecosystem and its\nOpen Marketplace is very advanced in terms of tech compared to almost any other\nend-user-focused blockchain product. The vision, mission, and disruptive\npotential of such a platform is also a shared feeling within all of the people\nmet during this trip.\n\nBut getting this product into people’s hands is equally important, if not more. \nThe best product in the world serves no purpose if it is not being used by\nanyone. This trip provided the team with a lot of resources, connections, and\noffers that will help Particl jump in with two feet into this new\nadoption-focused phase the project is headed to.\n\nThe team has been able to discuss, in detail and with valuable outside\nperspectives, the next steps moving into 2020. What’s coming next in 2020 will\nbe very methodical and carefully planned, and it’s all about getting that\nadoption going. Thanks to this US West Coast trip, the team is now equipped with\nthe best resources it could have hoped for at the best time imaginable. Let’s do\nthis! ?\n\nWhat’s Next?\nThe development team has been focused on the next few items, as identified a\nwhile ago\n[https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b]\n, required before aggressive adoption strategies can start getting a worthy\nconversion rate. Indeed, the Open Marketplace and Particl Desktop still lack a\nfew features the team would like to have before actively trying to drive users\nto the marketplace.\n\nIn the meantime, the communications and strategy team is now embarking in a new\nphase to start the onboarding of users as soon as the platform is ready for\nadoption. The team will be taking part in various internal workshops in Berlin\nin the coming weeks along with key connections and advisors made throughout the\npast two weeks. That’s to craft strategies related to the user adoption of the\nOpen Marketplace and the Particl network in general and help the project pivot\ntowards a a more “business” focused phase in the most efficient manner possible.\n\nIt is very clear, the team is coming back from this US West Coast trip extremely\nmotivated and hungry for success. A lot of doors are opening up, on all fronts,\ndirectly to Particl and also to the blockchain industry itself. The world is\nreceptive to the idea of blockchain technology but cautious due to this\nnow-very-long bear market. It is why the next steps of the way need to be very\nmethodological to seize the most of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\n\nParticl Team After Epicenter’s ClosureAs you might start to understand simply by\nreading this post, this trip marks the beginning of brand new objectives,\nchallenges, and goals for the project. Think of it as the “war room phase”, the\nmoment where strategies are made and carefully, methodically set in motion.\n\nNext Locations of the Particl World Tour\nWith that in mind, the team is going to be attending, in a smaller capacity, two\nadditional events and then conclude it’s already very worthy Particl World Tour.\n\nIndeed, you’ll be able to find Particl at Blockshow Asia\n[https://blockshow.com/], in Singapore, and Slush Helsinki\n[https://www.slush.org/events/helsinki/], in Finland.\n\nAt Blockshow Asia, the same boots-on-the-grounds approach as used during SFBW’s\nside-events and WCC will be applied. It will be all about establishing the first\npoints of contact and reconvening with key people within the Asian market to get\nas much insight as possible. Don’t forget, as mentioned in a previous blog post\n[https://particl.news/particl-in-singapore-consensus-asia-a3be041d315e] on\nParticl.news, Singapore is a place of interest for Particl because of new tax\nregulations being proposed which would make any sale paid for with\ncryptocurrencies a tax-free event. It is a direct use-case for buying and\nselling using cryptocurrencies and a great opportunity for Particl to shine\nbrightly. This is, quite simply, crypto having a clear shot at going mainstream\nin Singapore…\n\nAt Slush Helsinki, a tech startup/founder focused conference, the team will be\noperating a booth and meeting up with various advisors and mentors specifically\ngoing to the event to help out motivated, young entrepreneurs.

Along the way, Particl met with tech evangelists, developers, capital funds, business owners, market makers, innovators, and was even able to scoop a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190348538498019329\"><strong>new advisor</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-woods-3243a1167\"><strong>Bryan Woods</strong></a> (<a href=\"https://spend.com\"><strong>Spend.com</strong></a>’s President) to assist and support the project in making the best out of the many opportunities currently opening up within the payment and eCommerce industries. <strong>The team had the blessing of being accompanied, for most of the trip, by Crypto PR Lab, a San Francisco-based PR firm</strong> that has grown closer to the team ever since meeting for the first time at Consensus 2019.

This strategy allowed to cover a lot of ground at once and has brought very valuable connections that could then be best leveraged by the fact that the whole team ended up meeting as one for SFBW’s Epicenter. It doesn’t happen all the time that so many team members get to meet, in-person, and so the strategy was to optimize this precious opportunity and get the most done out of it.</p><hr><h2 id=\"san-francisco\">San Francisco</h2><p>While a portion of the team was in Vegas for Money2020 and WCC, another portion was already in San Francisco for the start of the San Francisco Blockchain Week. Epicenter, the week’s main and last event, is where Particl held a booth for two days as well as a 30-minute talk. But in no way was it the only event of interest!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-AQI1srPnv0aVadXpHrS-YQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>The city was literally buzzing about blockchain and the many events attracted the entirety of the local, but very front running, San Francisco-based cryptocurrency community. It really felt home! Let’s not forget San Francisco and the Bay Area, in general, is the homeland of startups and the heart of the tech industry. People from all around the world join together with the hopes of creating the next new groundbreaking technology or project. Particl fits very much within that innovation-focused and very forward-thinking mindset.</p><p>SFBW’s particular type of schedule (having the main event at the very end of the week) proved to be an excellent opportunity for the team to initiate the first points of contact with multiple key people by attending many of the side-events and evening receptions organized all throughout the week. Then, during the two days of Epicenter, came the opportunities to capitalize on these contacts made during the week by demonstrating the marketplace and have more quality time with these people.</p><p>Before Epicenter, the Particl team attended CESC, the San Francisco Blockchain Week’s kickoff event where it set up a table at the location to improvise a quick Particl booth with a couple of computers running the Open Marketplace. As is now usual, the marketplace really impressed and gained great reactions and interest which brought new pairs of eyes on Particl and made new friends around, like the stand-up guys over at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto\"><strong>Cracking Crypto</strong></a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto\">,</a> for example.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-1s_bWqb9sJ0nOJzAx_jmyA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Dr. Kap Giving an Interview to the Cracking Crypto Show</figcaption></figure><p>The team also attended more than a dozen side-events (most of the time, many a night…who needs sleep?) all throughout the week such as receptions organized by Polychain Capital, Pantera Capital, Outliers Ventures, Starfish Network, eToro, Huobi, OceanEx, and more. The connections established at all these events really did set the state for when everybody would be crossing paths again later at Epicenter.</p><h2 id=\"las-vegas\">Las Vegas</h2><p>And so while a portion of the team was in San Francisco for the start of SFBW, Joe Fisher and Cryptoguard were in Las Vegas, to attend <a href=\"https://us.money2020.com/\"><strong>Money2020</strong></a> and the <a href=\"https://worldcryptocon.com/\"><strong>World Crypto Conference (WCC)</strong></a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-0D0gVZM4ldY_H1DLZBPlyw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl Welcomes Bryan Woods, Spend.com’s President, as New Advisor</figcaption></figure><p>At <a href=\"https://us.money2020.com/\">Money2020</a>, a Fintech conference focused on innovations within the payment industry, the focus was entirely on <strong>sealing the deal with a new advisor, Bryan Woods, President at Spend.com.</strong> Spend.com is a team that has been growing closer to the Particl team ever since meeting at the Consensus 2019 booth in New York City.</p><p><strong>The Particl team spent 2 full days working at Spend.com’s booth</strong> (one of the big sponsors of Money2020) to discuss and work on various strategies moving into 2020. <strong>This is a direct follow-up to another in-person trip the team made earlier in October 2019 to meet up with Spend.com.</strong> Meeting once again, at Money2020, allowed both teams to initiate and walk the first steps of a long-term relationship together. More details will follow this coming Thursday in a blog post published on Particl.news. Definitely stay tuned!</p><p>Special shoutout to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nicholas_Merten\"><strong>Nicholas Merten</strong></a>, aka <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCatR7nWbYrkVXdxXb4cGXw\"><strong>DataDash</strong></a>, which the team had the pleasure to cross paths with at Money2020. His focus, dedication, and projects to help cryptocurrencies move further along the path to mainstream adoption really impressed!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-nQDXMaDJpFACqsgG28IwAw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Nicholas Merten, aka Datadash, hanging out with Particl</figcaption></figure><p>Then, after Money2020, Cryptoguard flew to join the rest of the team in San Francisco while Joe Fisher stayed an additional day in Vegas to take part in the <a href=\"https://worldcryptocon.com/\">WCC conference</a>.</p><p>WCC was the perfect occasion to meet with some of the people the team had been looking forward to meetup with again and yet another quality event to make the first points of contact with various people. Indeed, just like SFBW, WCC attracted a quality crowd as well as many leaders within the blockchain industry, some of which couldn’t make it to SFBW. In that scenario, splitting the team into two different cities really reaped a lot of benefits for Particl.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-oOCQxSc4XZuiiGtoCW04Iw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Joe Fisher and Masha Prusakova at WCC 2019</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"epicenter-sfbw-s-main-event\">Epicenter — SFBW’s Main Event</h2><p>And then came <a href=\"https://sfblockchainweek.io/\"><strong>Epicenter</strong></a>, the main event of the San Francisco Blockchain Week. The Particl team all met as one the day before and came to the conference as a gold sponsor, had a booth right next to the main entrance, and gave a 30-minute talk on the Industry Stage.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-sh0iU5S6N1qmWjpI_stjWw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl Team Showing Off the Open Marketplace at SFBW’s Epicenter</figcaption></figure><p>Just like throughout the first part of the week, the reactions at the booth were overwhelmingly good and, maybe strangely enough, people still looked surprised that a fully decentralized and no compromise blockchain project is already live and looking so good, even to this day. This is the typical feedback Particl has been receiving ever since it started going to more events this year.</p><p>Epicenter’s crowd was definitely smaller than Consensus, but it was much more focused and in “business mode”. The reason for this is actually important to understand. <strong>The people who still remain in blockchain after a more than two-year-long bear market and keep attending these kinds of events are the true pioneers that will propel the next blockchain wave.</strong> They are the people fighting in the trenches, against all odds, to make sure the blockchain revolution will one day catch up on the mainstream level.</p><p>And in San Francisco, of all places, a place renowned for how many tech innovations it generates every year. The people attending these conferences don’t look at the industry with a narrow-minded view. No, they instead know the long-term potential of these groundbreaking technologies and are the ones that are making it happen.</p><p>This is actually the main reason Particl wanted to attend SFBW. The team knew the potential of this local blockchain community, <strong>thanks in part to attending the SF-based </strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-in-san-francisco-bitcoin2019-571fe31fe396\"><strong>Bitcoin2019</strong></a><strong> conference earlier in the year</strong>, and knew it would be a perfectly receptive and excited crowd.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-y1kyfpZ9pREc31ZUZG5RuA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman at Blockchain Research Institute</figcaption></figure><p>And the team was right! Particl had the opportunity to spend some high-quality time with thought leaders and experts from many different industries and received many advice and resources. For example, the Particl team had the chance to meet with <strong>Don Tapscott, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman at </strong><a href=\"https://www.blockchainresearchinstitute.org/\"><strong>Blockchain Research Institute</strong></a>, and earn 30 minutes of his time just before flying out to Europe.</p><p>Indeed, just like with Don Tapscott, many similar breakout meetings, sit-downs, and evening-long discussions happened with several key people working on pushing blockchain forward. The team met with media, capital firms, lawyers, developers, business developers, the inventor of eGift cards, and even a guy that can solve a Rubics cube blindfolded, but more importantly, made many new friends on the way that are as passionate and dedicated to see cryptocurrencies succeed.</p><p>The team also had a 30-minute speaking slot on the Industry Stage and sent Dr. Kap on stage. Some of the people the team has met throughout the week attended the talk which further helped them understand the project’s vision and intentions. The official presentation video will be published within a few days by the SFBW organizers. In the meantime, you can check out Dr. Kap’s presentation on Particl’s Youtube channel.</p><blockquote>The upload originally is a <a href=\"https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB\"><strong>Periscope</strong></a><a href=\"https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB\"><strong>video</strong></a><strong> </strong>taken by Particl’s Community Manager, Guillaume Benayoun.

They get the potential of blockchain and Particl both. <strong>They want to see the industry succeed and the products powered by blockchain land in the hands of everyday people.</strong></p><p>While the team already knew about the quality of the Particl platform, it is now crystal clear from all the feedback received that the Particl ecosystem and its Open Marketplace is very advanced in terms of tech compared to almost any other end-user-focused blockchain product. The vision, mission, and disruptive potential of such a platform is also a shared feeling within all of the people met during this trip.</p><p><strong>But getting this product into people’s hands is equally important, if not more.</strong> The best product in the world serves no purpose if it is not being used by anyone. This trip provided the team with a lot of resources, connections, and offers that will help Particl jump in with two feet into this new adoption-focused phase the project is headed to.</p><p>The team has been able to discuss, in detail and with valuable outside perspectives, the next steps moving into 2020. What’s coming next in 2020 will be very methodical and carefully planned, and it’s all about getting that adoption going. Thanks to this US West Coast trip, the team is now equipped with the best resources it could have hoped for at the best time imaginable. Let’s do this! ?</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s Next?</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-SB2ytltBLugFKL1rJVhF_Q.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>The development team has been focused on the next few items, <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b\">as identified a while ago</a>, required before aggressive adoption strategies can start getting a worthy conversion rate. Indeed, the Open Marketplace and Particl Desktop still lack a few features the team would like to have before actively trying to drive users to the marketplace.</p><p>In the meantime, <strong>the communications and strategy team is now embarking in a new phase</strong> to start the onboarding of users as soon as the platform is ready for adoption. The team will be taking part in various internal workshops in Berlin in the coming weeks along with key connections and advisors made throughout the past two weeks. That’s to craft strategies related to the user adoption of the Open Marketplace and the Particl network in general and help the project pivot towards a a more “business” focused phase in the most efficient manner possible.</p><p>It is very clear, <strong>the team is coming back from this US West Coast trip extremely motivated and hungry for success</strong>. A lot of doors are opening up, on all fronts, directly to Particl and also to the blockchain industry itself. The world is receptive to the idea of blockchain technology but cautious due to this now-very-long bear market. It is why the next steps of the way need to be very methodological to seize the most of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-Gbg9aHfYJ9bhiThjAvvKwQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl Team After Epicenter’s Closure</figcaption></figure><p>As you might start to understand simply by reading this post, <strong>this trip marks the beginning of brand new objectives, challenges, and goals for the project.</strong> Think of it as the “war room phase”, the moment where strategies are made and carefully, methodically set in motion.</p><h3 id=\"next-locations-of-the-particl-world-tour\">Next Locations of the Particl World Tour</h3><p>With that in mind, the team is going to be attending, in a smaller capacity, two additional events and then conclude it’s already very worthy Particl World Tour.</p><p>Indeed, you’ll be able to find Particl at <a href=\"https://blockshow.com/\"><strong>Blockshow Asia</strong></a>, in Singapore, and <a href=\"https://www.slush.org/events/helsinki/\"><strong>Slush Helsinki</strong></a>, in Finland.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-cWDe1_sIGidEmR1cFeidDw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>At Blockshow Asia, the same boots-on-the-grounds approach as used during SFBW’s side-events and WCC will be applied. It will be all about establishing the first points of contact and reconvening with key people within the Asian market to get as much insight as possible. Don’t forget, as mentioned in a <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-in-singapore-consensus-asia-a3be041d315e\"><strong>previous blog post</strong></a> on Particl.news, <strong>Singapore is a place of interest for Particl because of new tax regulations being proposed which would make any sale paid for with cryptocurrencies a tax-free event.</strong> It is a direct use-case for buying and selling using cryptocurrencies and a great opportunity for Particl to shine brightly. This is, quite simply, crypto having a clear shot at going mainstream in Singapore…</p><p>At Slush Helsinki, a tech startup/founder focused conference, the team will be operating a booth and meeting up with various advisors and mentors specifically going to the event to help out motivated, young entrepreneurs. The team will consist of Juha Kovanen (Marketplace Lead Developer), Gerlof van Ek (Lead Designer, Developer), Dr. Kapil Amarasinghe (UK Particl Ambassador), and Gloria (Particl’s Communications &amp; Strategy Team).</p><p>Both these events will allow Particl to receive even more feedback, advice, and resources as it jumps right into its next phase.

As is now usual, the marketplace really impressed and gained great reactions and interest which brought new pairs of eyes on Particl and made new friends around, like the stand-up guys over at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto\"><strong>Cracking Crypto</strong></a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto\">,</a> for example.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-1s_bWqb9sJ0nOJzAx_jmyA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Dr. Kap Giving an Interview to the Cracking Crypto Show</figcaption></figure><p>The team also attended more than a dozen side-events (most of the time, many a night…who needs sleep?) all throughout the week such as receptions organized by Polychain Capital, Pantera Capital, Outliers Ventures, Starfish Network, eToro, Huobi, OceanEx, and more. The connections established at all these events really did set the state for when everybody would be crossing paths again later at Epicenter.</p><h2 id=\"las-vegas\">Las Vegas</h2><p>And so while a portion of the team was in San Francisco for the start of SFBW, Joe Fisher and Cryptoguard were in Las Vegas, to attend <a href=\"https://us.money2020.com/\"><strong>Money2020</strong></a> and the <a href=\"https://worldcryptocon.com/\"><strong>World Crypto Conference (WCC)</strong></a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-0D0gVZM4ldY_H1DLZBPlyw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl Welcomes Bryan Woods, Spend.com’s President, as New Advisor</figcaption></figure><p>At <a href=\"https://us.money2020.com/\">Money2020</a>, a Fintech conference focused on innovations within the payment industry, the focus was entirely on <strong>sealing the deal with a new advisor, Bryan Woods, President at Spend.com.</strong> Spend.com is a team that has been growing closer to the Particl team ever since meeting at the Consensus 2019 booth in New York City.</p><p><strong>The Particl team spent 2 full days working at Spend.com’s booth</strong> (one of the big sponsors of Money2020) to discuss and work on various strategies moving into 2020. <strong>This is a direct follow-up to another in-person trip the team made earlier in October 2019 to meet up with Spend.com.</strong> Meeting once again, at Money2020, allowed both teams to initiate and walk the first steps of a long-term relationship together. More details will follow this coming Thursday in a blog post published on Particl.news. Definitely stay tuned!</p><p>Special shoutout to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nicholas_Merten\"><strong>Nicholas Merten</strong></a>, aka <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCatR7nWbYrkVXdxXb4cGXw\"><strong>DataDash</strong></a>, which the team had the pleasure to cross paths with at Money2020. His focus, dedication, and projects to help cryptocurrencies move further along the path to mainstream adoption really impressed!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-nQDXMaDJpFACqsgG28IwAw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Nicholas Merten, aka Datadash, hanging out with Particl</figcaption></figure><p>Then, after Money2020, Cryptoguard flew to join the rest of the team in San Francisco while Joe Fisher stayed an additional day in Vegas to take part in the <a href=\"https://worldcryptocon.com/\">WCC conference</a>.</p><p>WCC was the perfect occasion to meet with some of the people the team had been looking forward to meetup with again and yet another quality event to make the first points of contact with various people. Indeed, just like SFBW, WCC attracted a quality crowd as well as many leaders within the blockchain industry, some of which couldn’t make it to SFBW. In that scenario, splitting the team into two different cities really reaped a lot of benefits for Particl.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-oOCQxSc4XZuiiGtoCW04Iw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Joe Fisher and Masha Prusakova at WCC 2019</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"epicenter-sfbw-s-main-event\">Epicenter — SFBW’s Main Event</h2><p>And then came <a href=\"https://sfblockchainweek.io/\"><strong>Epicenter</strong></a>, the main event of the San Francisco Blockchain Week. The Particl team all met as one the day before and came to the conference as a gold sponsor, had a booth right next to the main entrance, and gave a 30-minute talk on the Industry Stage.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-sh0iU5S6N1qmWjpI_stjWw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl Team Showing Off the Open Marketplace at SFBW’s Epicenter</figcaption></figure><p>Just like throughout the first part of the week, the reactions at the booth were overwhelmingly good and, maybe strangely enough, people still looked surprised that a fully decentralized and no compromise blockchain project is already live and looking so good, even to this day. This is the typical feedback Particl has been receiving ever since it started going to more events this year.</p><p>Epicenter’s crowd was definitely smaller than Consensus, but it was much more focused and in “business mode”. The reason for this is actually important to understand. <strong>The people who still remain in blockchain after a more than two-year-long bear market and keep attending these kinds of events are the true pioneers that will propel the next blockchain wave.</strong> They are the people fighting in the trenches, against all odds, to make sure the blockchain revolution will one day catch up on the mainstream level.</p><p>And in San Francisco, of all places, a place renowned for how many tech innovations it generates every year. The people attending these conferences don’t look at the industry with a narrow-minded view. No, they instead know the long-term potential of these groundbreaking technologies and are the ones that are making it happen.</p><p>This is actually the main reason Particl wanted to attend SFBW. The team knew the potential of this local blockchain community, <strong>thanks in part to attending the SF-based </strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-in-san-francisco-bitcoin2019-571fe31fe396\"><strong>Bitcoin2019</strong></a><strong> conference earlier in the year</strong>, and knew it would be a perfectly receptive and excited crowd.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-y1kyfpZ9pREc31ZUZG5RuA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman at Blockchain Research Institute</figcaption></figure><p>And the team was right! Particl had the opportunity to spend some high-quality time with thought leaders and experts from many different industries and received many advice and resources. For example, the Particl team had the chance to meet with <strong>Don Tapscott, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman at </strong><a href=\"https://www.blockchainresearchinstitute.org/\"><strong>Blockchain Research Institute</strong></a>, and earn 30 minutes of his time just before flying out to Europe.</p><p>Indeed, just like with Don Tapscott, many similar breakout meetings, sit-downs, and evening-long discussions happened with several key people working on pushing blockchain forward. The team met with media, capital firms, lawyers, developers, business developers, the inventor of eGift cards, and even a guy that can solve a Rubics cube blindfolded, but more importantly, made many new friends on the way that are as passionate and dedicated to see cryptocurrencies succeed.</p><p>The team also had a 30-minute speaking slot on the Industry Stage and sent Dr. Kap on stage. Some of the people the team has met throughout the week attended the talk which further helped them understand the project’s vision and intentions. The official presentation video will be published within a few days by the SFBW organizers. In the meantime, you can check out Dr. Kap’s presentation on Particl’s Youtube channel.</p><blockquote>The upload originally is a <a href=\"https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB\"><strong>Periscope</strong></a><a href=\"https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB\"><strong>video</strong></a><strong> </strong>taken by Particl’s Community Manager, Guillaume Benayoun.

They get the potential of blockchain and Particl both. <strong>They want to see the industry succeed and the products powered by blockchain land in the hands of everyday people.</strong></p><p>While the team already knew about the quality of the Particl platform, it is now crystal clear from all the feedback received that the Particl ecosystem and its Open Marketplace is very advanced in terms of tech compared to almost any other end-user-focused blockchain product. The vision, mission, and disruptive potential of such a platform is also a shared feeling within all of the people met during this trip.</p><p><strong>But getting this product into people’s hands is equally important, if not more.</strong> The best product in the world serves no purpose if it is not being used by anyone. This trip provided the team with a lot of resources, connections, and offers that will help Particl jump in with two feet into this new adoption-focused phase the project is headed to.</p><p>The team has been able to discuss, in detail and with valuable outside perspectives, the next steps moving into 2020. What’s coming next in 2020 will be very methodical and carefully planned, and it’s all about getting that adoption going. Thanks to this US West Coast trip, the team is now equipped with the best resources it could have hoped for at the best time imaginable. Let’s do this! ?</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s Next?</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-SB2ytltBLugFKL1rJVhF_Q.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>The development team has been focused on the next few items, <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b\">as identified a while ago</a>, required before aggressive adoption strategies can start getting a worthy conversion rate. Indeed, the Open Marketplace and Particl Desktop still lack a few features the team would like to have before actively trying to drive users to the marketplace.</p><p>In the meantime, <strong>the communications and strategy team is now embarking in a new phase</strong> to start the onboarding of users as soon as the platform is ready for adoption. The team will be taking part in various internal workshops in Berlin in the coming weeks along with key connections and advisors made throughout the past two weeks. That’s to craft strategies related to the user adoption of the Open Marketplace and the Particl network in general and help the project pivot towards a a more “business” focused phase in the most efficient manner possible.</p><p>It is very clear, <strong>the team is coming back from this US West Coast trip extremely motivated and hungry for success</strong>. A lot of doors are opening up, on all fronts, directly to Particl and also to the blockchain industry itself. The world is receptive to the idea of blockchain technology but cautious due to this now-very-long bear market. It is why the next steps of the way need to be very methodological to seize the most of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-Gbg9aHfYJ9bhiThjAvvKwQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl Team After Epicenter’s Closure</figcaption></figure><p>As you might start to understand simply by reading this post, <strong>this trip marks the beginning of brand new objectives, challenges, and goals for the project.</strong> Think of it as the “war room phase”, the moment where strategies are made and carefully, methodically set in motion.</p><h3 id=\"next-locations-of-the-particl-world-tour\">Next Locations of the Particl World Tour</h3><p>With that in mind, the team is going to be attending, in a smaller capacity, two additional events and then conclude it’s already very worthy Particl World Tour.</p><p>Indeed, you’ll be able to find Particl at <a href=\"https://blockshow.com/\"><strong>Blockshow Asia</strong></a>, in Singapore, and <a href=\"https://www.slush.org/events/helsinki/\"><strong>Slush Helsinki</strong></a>, in Finland.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-cWDe1_sIGidEmR1cFeidDw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>At Blockshow Asia, the same boots-on-the-grounds approach as used during SFBW’s side-events and WCC will be applied. It will be all about establishing the first points of contact and reconvening with key people within the Asian market to get as much insight as possible. Don’t forget, as mentioned in a <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-in-singapore-consensus-asia-a3be041d315e\"><strong>previous blog post</strong></a> on Particl.news, <strong>Singapore is a place of interest for Particl because of new tax regulations being proposed which would make any sale paid for with cryptocurrencies a tax-free event.</strong> It is a direct use-case for buying and selling using cryptocurrencies and a great opportunity for Particl to shine brightly. This is, quite simply, crypto having a clear shot at going mainstream in Singapore…</p><p>At Slush Helsinki, a tech startup/founder focused conference, the team will be operating a booth and meeting up with various advisors and mentors specifically going to the event to help out motivated, young entrepreneurs. The team will consist of Juha Kovanen (Marketplace Lead Developer), Gerlof van Ek (Lead Designer, Developer), Dr. Kapil Amarasinghe (UK Particl Ambassador), and Gloria (Particl’s Communications &#x26; Strategy Team).</p><p>Both these events will allow Particl to receive even more feedback, advice, and resources as it jumps right into its next phase. The timing of it all couldn’t be better!</p><hr><h2 id=\"you-too-can-be-a-part-of-it-\">You, Too, Can Be a Part of it!</h2><p>The best connections happen face-to-face, this is simply how things happen in the space. The people you meet, in-person, by going to conferences and their related side-events are not the same crypto people you meet online. These are the active and focused people working day and night on the blockchain revolution. They are the ones that make it all happen!</p><p><strong>For this reason, the Particl team very strongly encourages you to go out there and attend your local blockchain events.</strong> Crypto is not dead, it’s alive and kicking in a way that might surprise you! The bear market is making innovators more motivated and hungry for success, a feeling that is not always shared by the “online crypto community”. Go out there, meet people face-to-face, and be right in the middle of the biggest revolution of our times (with no hyperbole added here ?).</p><p>After all, meeting other crypto fans and innovators to change the world is just one part of why you should attend these events. The other part is…well, it is so much FUN! Dare try it just once and you’ll be hooked!</p><hr><p>Stay tuned for <strong>more news about Spend.com’s relationship with Particl this coming Thursday, the 14th of November</strong>.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model.

the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
