The source code linked to here\nis not the actual tagged release source code. Please contact Particl for source\ncode information. ...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.6] * Desktop\n   download: [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.0.1]\n   https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.6\n * Core\n   download: [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.3]\n   https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.6\n\nParticl Desktop 2.3.6 introduces a new GUI tool to quickly identify the anon and\nblind outputs from all your unlocked wallets. It uses the new Particl Core\n0.19.2.6 release, which improves the output tracing script.\n\nTo see the complete list of changes for Particl Core 0.19.2.6, follow this link\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/branch_0.19.2.6/doc/release-notes-particl.md#01926]\n.\n\nTo use the new tool, simply follow these steps.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1- Open Particl Desktop 2.3.6 and ensure you are running Particl Core 0.19.2.6.\n\n2- Unlock all of your wallets by opening each of them in the bar on the left and\nclicking the lock pad icon at the top right corner of the client.\n\n3- Once all your wallets are unlocked, click on the printer icon at the top\nright corner of the client and a new window will appear.\n\n4- Choose where you want to export your output data, and then click on the \nExport button.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter clicking the Export button, a file named frozen_blinded_data.txt will be\ncreated in the location of your choice.

You shouldn’t need to download the new Particl Core\nversion separately unless you want to collect your outputs without using Particl\nDesktop.\nParticl V3 Progress Report\nWe are happy today to also provide a detailed Particl V3 progress report. This\nlist contains all the recent bug fixes and outstanding items since the last\nParticl V3 progress report.\n\nAdditionally, it can now be announced that any slowdown in the progress of\nParticl V3, as mentioned in the March Project Update, has been duly resolved.\nThe development of Particl V3 is now back at a regular pace.\n\nTo-Do\nA list of remaining fixes to include before Particl V3 can go live on mainnet.\nSome of these items are already fixed but require additional testing while the\nothers are relatively minor, except for the zmq.node issue that occurs for some\nWindows users.\n\n * Once a market is blacklisted, it does not allow for further processing of any\n   related activity. For example, the market cannot be removed, product\n   templates for the market cannot be created, etc. The fix has been implemented\n   and is currently in testing phase.\n * An expired listing item that has been added to the cart is automatically\n   removed from the particl-market but remains added to the cart. The fix has\n   been implemented and is currently in testing phase.\n * A situation can occur during which releasing the escrow without completing\n   the “shipping” step can result in both parties becoming stuck in the\n   “shipping step”. The fix has been implemented and is currently in testing\n   phase.\n * Category filter for general markets other than the default Open Marketplace\n   does not work as expected. The fix has been implemented and is currently in\n   testing phase.\n * The change implemented to fix the category filter requires a change to the\n   implementation of selecting a category during the product template\n   creation/editing.\n * Fix the zmq.node error on startup occurring on some Windows machines.\n * Allow external links listed via the Help and Support page to open in the\n   user's browser instead of inside a self-contained webview \"window\". There are\n   some concerns about this, so this will likely be temporary until a better\n   solution can be implemented.\n * Add dynamic loading screen quotations.\n * There is no means to delete a published product from the Inventory tab.\n * Display the category creation modal or otherwise direct the user to the\n   category creation process after creating a new storefront market.\n * Add additional text to the market creation section to ensure that there is no\n   confusion about the market being private by default and only being known if\n   the market details are explicitly shared with others or the market is\n   promoted.\n\nIn Progress\nA list of items currently being worked on.\n\n * Updating Particl Desktop code in V3 to be compatible with recent API\n   improvements applied in particl-market. Needs some significant testing to\n   ensure all things are working, so takes a non-trivial amount of time to\n   complete.\n * In the wallet module, the Address label is not clearly indicated that it\n   requires additional action (clicking the button) to save the label.\n * Test Particl Core 0.19.2.6 with Particl Desktop 3.0, fixing any issues that\n   may occur.\n\nCompleted\nA list of the items that have been completed since the last Particl V3 progress\nreport.\n\n * Add 32-bit Windows builds back in as before.\n * Setting all shipping costs to 0 causes some errors while publishing a product\n   and purchasing.\n * On the listings page, add a checkbox-like control to each item to avoid\n   confusion about unselecting a selected country.\n * Allow for the transaction ID to be selected/copied in the Transaction table.\n * Ensure the 'Show inactive and archived' checkbox in the Orders pages is\n   checked/enabled by default to prevent orders from seemingly disappearing once\n   they are complete.\n * Fixed an error that appeared when the Particl Desktop application is closed\n   while the marketplace is starting.\n * A menu dropdown with no additional identities for selection now indicates no\n   alternative identities for selection (rather than displaying nothing).\n * Presents a missing \"unlock wallet\" prompt when creating a market with an\n   encrypted wallet/identity.\n * Display an alternative error message when accepting a bid fails due to having\n   insufficient available funds.\n * Swap the position of the public and anon balance values in the Market\n   Overview display.\n * Updated a setting description to describe its intended purpose more\n   accurately.\n\nETA\nDue to the recent inflationary bug, all anon and blind outputs are temporarily\nfrozen. And because the Particl Marketplace works using anon and blind outputs,\nit is not operational until the upcoming hardfork that unfreezes outputs occurs.\n\nFor this reason, a mainnet release of Particl V3 is not possible until the\nhardfork. In the meantime, you can expect one or more testnet releases of\nParticl V3 to properly test all the new bug fixes and improvements made to it\nsince the first testnet release.\n\nIf the mainnet release is entirely ready before the hardfork takes place, the\nteam will start working on additional Particl Desktop deliverables/features in a\nseparate branch which may, or may not, be merged in time for the first V3\nmainnet release. If a feature has been started and is not ready for release when\nthe hardfork takes place, it’ll then be included in a subsequent release.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This list contains all the recent bug fixes and outstanding items since the last Particl V3 progress report.</p><p>Additionally, it can now be announced that any slowdown in the progress of Particl V3, as mentioned in the March Project Update, has been duly resolved. The development of Particl V3 is now back at a regular pace.</p><h3 id=\"to-do\">To-Do</h3><p>A list of remaining fixes to include before Particl V3 can go live on mainnet. Some of these items are already fixed but require additional testing while the others are relatively minor, except for the zmq.node issue that occurs for some Windows users.</p><ul><li>Once a market is blacklisted, it does not allow for further processing of any related activity. For example, the market cannot be removed, product templates for the market cannot be created, etc. <strong>The fix has been implemented and is currently in testing phase.</strong></li><li>An expired listing item that has been added to the cart is automatically removed from the particl-market but remains added to the cart. <strong>The fix has been implemented and is currently in testing phase.</strong></li><li>A situation can occur during which releasing the escrow without completing the “shipping” step can result in both parties becoming stuck in the “shipping step”. <strong>The fix has been implemented and is currently in testing phase.</strong></li><li>Category filter for general markets other than the default Open Marketplace does not work as expected.<strong> The fix has been implemented and is currently in testing phase.</strong></li><li>The change implemented to fix the category filter requires a change to the implementation of selecting a category during the product template creation/editing.</li><li>Fix the <code class=\"language-text\">zmq.node</code> error on startup occurring on some Windows machines.</li><li>Allow external links listed via the Help and Support page to open in the user's browser instead of inside a self-contained webview \"window\". There are some concerns about this, so this will likely be temporary until a better solution can be implemented.</li><li>Add dynamic loading screen quotations.</li><li>There is no means to delete a published product from the Inventory tab.</li><li>Display the category creation modal or otherwise direct the user to the category creation process after creating a new storefront market.</li><li>Add additional text to the market creation section to ensure that there is no confusion about the market being private by default and only being known if the market details are explicitly shared with others or the market is promoted.</li></ul><h3 id=\"in-progress\">In Progress</h3><p>A list of items currently being worked on.</p><ul><li>Updating Particl Desktop code in V3 to be compatible with recent API improvements applied in particl-market.

chatter in the\ncommunity chatrooms as of late, then you probably already know by now that\nParticl is transitioning into an exciting new phase.\n\nIndeed, we have already announced that, in the days to come, there would be two\nmajor proposals published on the CCS that require community consensus to be set\nin motion. These are the output claim management proposal and the one to enable\na brand new, powerful treasury model.\n\nThat’s directly in line with our recent efforts to put more focus on community\ngovernance and improve the degree of decentralization of the project. This now\nputs you in a much more influential position.\n\nToday, we are thrilled to reveal all the details and parameters of this on-chain\nand entirely decentralized voting mechanism.\n\nLet’s jump right in!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Contents\n * CCS Proposals\n * On-Chain Voting\n * Approval Rates, Quorum, Duration, and Consensus\n   [/on-chain-voting-and-ccs-proposals/approval-rates-quorum-duration-and-consensus]\n * Potential Voting Outcomes\n * Proposal Lifecycle\n * Community Fund\n * First Proposal Coming in on Wednesday\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCCS Proposals\nAs explained, in detail, in the introductory blog post of the CCS\n[https://particl.news/new-community-crowdfunding-system-f31f54231982/], anyone\ncan submit proposals on the CCS to request donations for initiatives from the\ncommunity. The introduction of the CCS was the first step in improving the level\nof decentralization and put in place a solid governance mechanism. The on-chain\nvoting system, which is now integrated into the CCS, is the next step to that\nmission.\n\nOn-Chain Voting\nThe on-chain network voting system is an additional governance tool that you can\nnow use to let your voice be heard. Any CCS proposal can now request a network\nvote to determine consensus. The most common use for network votes will be for\nproposals requesting initiatives to be funded from the Community Fund, but can\nbe used for other purposes as well. That's all up to the proposal owner!\n\nThe voting system works using staking weight, meaning that you register a vote\nevery time you stake a block on the network. This ensures that only those with a\nstake or interest in the project can vote, preventing outside influence from\naffecting the votes unjustly. It also encourages more people to stake their\ncoins to vote, which increases the network’s security and performance at the\nsame time.\n\nThe main benefit of on-chain voting compared to the legacy, SMSG-based voting\nsystem that was present in Particl Desktop is auditability and provability. With\nthis system, all votes, and their tallied results, are permanently written on\nthe blockchain, and results can provably be observed at any later time without\nany risk of tampering.\n\nIt's important to mention that staking pools, whose staking weight is made up of\nall the coins staked on the pool, also possess the power to vote. The more coins\na pool contains, the more voting power it has.\n\n> Note: For a vote to be counted, you need to successfully stake a block within\nthe voting period. If you own a small balance of PART (< 1,000 PART), it is\nlikely that you don’t stake a block every week and thus, won’t register a vote.\nApproval Rates, Quorum, Duration, and Consensus\n\nFor a proposal’s voting process to be considered valid, there are three\nrequirements to fill. They are the quorum requirement, the approval rate, and\nthe minimum duration of the voting process. The quorum requirement is determined\nby what percentage of the blocks within a given voting process cast a vote. The\napproval rate is defined by the percentage of the votes cast being in favor of a\nproposal.\n\nProposals that require a vote are separated into two different categories, each\none with its own value requirements.\n\nNon Protocol Consensus Votes\n * Quorum: 20% of blocks during the voting period\n * Approval rate: >= 60% in favor\n * Duration: 5,040 blocks minimum\n\nNon protocol consensus votes are proposals that do not require a major change in\nthe protocol to be made. Typically, they would be proposals claiming funds from\nthe Community Fund, for example, or determining the direction of a particular\ninitiative.\n\nFor a non protocol consensus vote to be considered valid, its voting period must\nbe a minimum of 5,040 blocks (roughly one week). Within that period, 20% of the\nblocks staked need to cast a vote for one of the available voting options. That\nmeans the quorum has to be at least 20%. Finally, to be considered as approved\nby the community, it needs to reach an approval rate of at least 60%, meaning at\nleast 60% of all the votes cast for the proposal are in favor of the proposed\nidea.\n\nProtocol Consensus Votes\n * Quorum: 20% of blocks during the voting period\n * Approval rate: >= 75% in favor\n * Duration: 10,080 blocks minimum\n\nProtocol consensus votes are a bit more important in scope and can have a more\nsignificant impact on the ecosystem. They are any proposal that requires a\nspecific change in the protocol, such as, for example, integrating a\ndecentralized treasury model, modifying the inflation rate of the blockchain,\nintroducing a new privacy technology, etc.\n\nJust like non protocol consensus votes, their quorum requirement stands at 20%.\nBut because of their increased level of importance and ramifications, they\nrequire a higher level of approval from the community. In fact, the required \napproval rate has to be at least 75%. Finally, the duration of any protocol\nconsensus vote has to be a minimum of 10,080 blocks (roughly two weeks) to give\nample time to anyone to be able to cast their vote.\n\nPotential Voting Outcomes\nThere are a few possible scenarios to a vote. Here they are with their\nrespective outcome.\n\n * If quorum is not met, the proposal is REJECTED ❌\n * If the quorum is met but the votes fail to meet the target approval rate, the\n   proposal is REJECTED ❌\n * If the quorum is met and the votes reach the approval rate (“Yes”), the\n   proposal is APPROVED ✅\n * If a voting round reaches its expiration before reaching quorum or the target\n   approval rate, the proposal expires and is REJECTED ❌\n\nProposal Lifecycle\nBelow is the basic process for submitting and evaluating proposals that require\na vote.\n\n * A proposal is submitted on the CCS. Click here\n   [https://ccs.particl.io/how-to-ccs/] to see how to submit your own proposal.\n * The proposal owner indicates, in the header, whether the proposal requires a\n   vote or not.\n * The proposal is reviewed by the CCS administrators and then published.\n * Valid proposals are open for discussion for a minimum of one week but voting\n   does not begin immediately. The proposal can be edited by its owner in\n   response to community feedback.\n * If a proposal becomes clearly inactive (proposal owner stops commenting on\n   the proposal or does not authorize the start of voting), a CCS administrator\n   may mark the proposal as “Abandoned”. Abandoned proposals are publicly\n   viewable, but cannot be edited, commented on, or be authorized to vote. A CCS\n   administrator can mark a proposal as abandoned at any time before the\n   proposal owner authorizes voting. Once the proposal owner authorizes voting\n   on a proposal, it cannot be abandoned unless the proposal owner revokes\n   voting on the proposal.\n * The proposal owner authorizes voting to start. A CCS administrator will then\n   assign a voting block interval to it (duration of the voting period).\n * The voting period begins for the number of blocks assigned by the\n   administrator. For example, one week is around 5,040 blocks.\n * When the voting period ends, the proposal is formally approved or rejected.\n   This depends on if the quorum and the approval rate are met.\n * When a proposal with a budget and deliverables is approved, work can begin.\n   The proposal owner can submit claims for funds upon completion of the\n   milestone deliverables that are pre-defined within the proposal.\n\nCommunity Fund\nInsightParticl Insight. View detailed information on all particl transactions\nand blocks.\n[https://explorer.particl.io/address/RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM]If you\nhave a great project or business you wish to build on Particl, or if there’s a\nservice you want to provide to the ecosystem, you may require funds to make it\nhappen. Ever since the initial release of the CCS, the only way to get that\nfunding was through community donations.\n\nWith the on-chain voting system, you will soon be able to claim funds from the \nCommunity Fund\n[https://explorer.particl.io/address/RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM] to help\nyou realize your initiative. And because this Community Fund belongs to all PART\nholders, it needs their approval to draw funds from it.\n\nIndeed, to incentivize more use of the CCS system by the community, the team is\ngoing to open up the Community Fund. All you’ll need to do to claim the funds is\ncraft a clear proposal that requires a vote and explains your initiative in\ndetail as well as why you need the funds. Then, you need to convince the Particl\ncommunity to vote in favor of your proposal and approve the claim of funds.\n\nFirst Proposal Coming in on Wednesday!\nYou won’t have to wait for too long to put on your first vote! As soon as this \nWednesday (28th of April, 2021), we will publish the first-ever proposal to\nrequire the use of the on-chain voting system.\n\nThis proposal, which was widely requested by the community, seeks to nominate\nthe Particl team as managers of the manual claim process required to unfreeze\nall legitimate anon and blind coins. These coins are currently frozen as part of\nthe emergency hardfork deployed by the team weeks ago and they need to be\nre-enabled as smoothly as possible. Keep an eye out on Particl News and the CCS\non Wednesday for all the details on the proposal!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith the support of the on-chain voting system as well as the upcoming few\nproposals, the Particl project is entering a brand new phase that emphasizes the\npower of the community much more. If you’ve ever had a great idea for a project,\nbusiness, or service you think would benefit the Particl ecosystem, you’ll have\nall the tools you need to make it happen, if you can convince the community!\n\nThis addition to the CCS marks a significant milestone for the project and\nshould lead to many more community contributions than we’ve ever seen. Don’t\nforget, if the decentralized treasury model proposal is approved, the Community\nFund is also going to grow in value and, if the price of PART increases, will\ngrow exponentially in value, opening even more doors. This has tremendous\npotential and we can’t wait to see what you, the community, will create with\nthese resources!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

The introduction of the CCS was the first step in improving the level of decentralization and put in place a solid governance mechanism. The on-chain voting system, which is now integrated into the CCS, is the next step to that mission.</p><h1 id=\"on-chain-voting\">On-Chain Voting</h1><p>The on-chain network voting system is an additional governance tool that you can now use to let your voice be heard. Any CCS proposal can now request a network vote to determine consensus. The most common use for network votes will be for proposals requesting initiatives to be funded from the Community Fund, but can be used for other purposes as well. That's all up to the proposal owner!</p><p>The voting system works using staking weight, meaning that you register a vote every time you stake a block on the network. This ensures that only those with a stake or interest in the project can vote, preventing outside influence from affecting the votes unjustly. It also encourages more people to stake their coins to vote, which increases the network’s security and performance at the same time.</p><p>The main benefit of on-chain voting compared to the legacy, SMSG-based voting system that was present in Particl Desktop is auditability and provability. With this system, all votes, and their tallied results, are permanently written on the blockchain, and results can provably be observed at any later time without any risk of tampering.</p><p>It's important to mention that staking pools, whose staking weight is made up of all the coins staked on the pool, also possess the power to vote. The more coins a pool contains, the more voting power it has.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> For a vote to be counted, you need to successfully stake a block within the voting period. If you own a small balance of PART (&#x3C; 1,000 PART), it is likely that you don’t stake a block every week and thus, won’t register a vote.</em></blockquote><h1 id=\"approval-rates-quorum-duration-and-consensus\">Approval Rates, Quorum, Duration, and Consensus</h1><p><br>For a proposal’s voting process to be considered valid, there are three requirements to fill. They are the <strong>quorum requirement</strong>, the <strong>approval rate</strong>, and the <strong>minimum duration of the voting process</strong>. The quorum requirement is determined by what percentage of the blocks within a given voting process cast a vote. The approval rate is defined by the percentage of the votes cast being in favor of a proposal.</p><p>Proposals that require a vote are separated into two different categories, each one with its own value requirements.</p><h3 id=\"non-protocol-consensus-votes\">Non Protocol Consensus Votes</h3><ul><li><strong>Quorum:</strong> 20% of blocks during the voting period</li><li><strong>Approval rate:</strong> >= 60% in favor</li><li><strong>Duration:</strong> 5,040 blocks minimum</li></ul><p>Non protocol consensus votes are proposals that do not require a major change in the protocol to be made. Typically, they would be proposals claiming funds from the Community Fund, for example, or determining the direction of a particular initiative.</p><p>For a non protocol consensus vote to be considered valid, its voting period must be a <strong>minimum of 5,040 blocks (roughly one week). </strong>Within that period, 20% of the blocks staked need to cast a vote for one of the available voting options. That means <strong>the quorum has to be at least 20%</strong>. Finally, to be considered as approved by the community, it needs to reach an <strong>approval rate of at least 60%</strong>, meaning at least 60% of all the votes cast for the proposal are in favor of the proposed idea.</p><h3 id=\"protocol-consensus-votes\">Protocol Consensus Votes</h3><ul><li><strong>Quorum:</strong> 20% of blocks during the voting period</li><li><strong>Approval rate:</strong> >= 75% in favor</li><li><strong>Duration:</strong> 10,080 blocks minimum</li></ul><p>Protocol consensus votes are a bit more important in scope and can have a more significant impact on the ecosystem. They are any proposal that requires a specific change in the protocol, such as, for example, integrating a decentralized treasury model, modifying the inflation rate of the blockchain, introducing a new privacy technology, etc.</p><p>Just like non protocol consensus votes, their <strong>quorum requirement stands at 20%</strong>. But because of their increased level of importance and ramifications, they require a higher level of approval from the community. In fact, the required <strong>approval rate has to be at least 75%</strong>. Finally, the duration of any protocol consensus vote has to be a <strong>minimum of 10,080 blocks (roughly two weeks)</strong> to give ample time to anyone to be able to cast their vote.</p><h1 id=\"potential-voting-outcomes\">Potential Voting Outcomes</h1><p>There are a few possible scenarios to a vote. Here they are with their respective outcome.</p><ul><li>If quorum is not met, the proposal is <strong>REJECTED </strong>❌</li><li>If the quorum is met but the votes fail to meet the target approval rate, the proposal is <strong>REJECTED </strong>❌</li><li>If the quorum is met and the votes reach the approval rate (“Yes”), the proposal is <strong>APPROVED </strong>✅</li><li>If a voting round reaches its expiration before reaching quorum or the target approval rate, the proposal expires and is <strong>REJECTED </strong>❌</li></ul><h1 id=\"proposal-lifecycle\">Proposal Lifecycle</h1><p>Below is the basic process for submitting and evaluating proposals that require a vote.</p><ul><li>A proposal is submitted on the CCS. <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io/how-to-ccs/\"><strong>Click here</strong></a> to see how to submit your own proposal.</li><li>The proposal owner indicates, in the header, whether the proposal requires a vote or not.</li><li>The proposal is reviewed by the CCS administrators and then published.</li><li>Valid proposals are open for discussion for a minimum of one week but voting does not begin immediately. The proposal can be edited by its owner in response to community feedback.</li><li>If a proposal becomes clearly inactive (proposal owner stops commenting on the proposal or does not authorize the start of voting), a CCS administrator may mark the proposal as “Abandoned”. Abandoned proposals are publicly viewable, but cannot be edited, commented on, or be authorized to vote. A CCS administrator can mark a proposal as abandoned at any time before the proposal owner authorizes voting. Once the proposal owner authorizes voting on a proposal, it cannot be abandoned unless the proposal owner revokes voting on the proposal.</li><li>The proposal owner authorizes voting to start. A CCS administrator will then assign a voting block interval to it (duration of the voting period).</li><li>The voting period begins for the number of blocks assigned by the administrator. For example, one week is around 5,040 blocks.</li><li>When the voting period ends, the proposal is formally approved or rejected. This depends on if the quorum and the approval rate are met.</li><li>When a proposal with a budget and deliverables is approved, work can begin. The proposal owner can submit claims for funds upon completion of the milestone deliverables that are pre-defined within the proposal.</li></ul><h2 id=\"community-fund\">Community Fund</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://explorer.particl.io/address/RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Insight</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Particl Insight.

Ever since the initial release of the CCS, the only way to get that funding was through community donations.</p><p>With the on-chain voting system, you will soon be able to claim funds from the <strong><a href=\"https://explorer.particl.io/address/RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM\">Community Fund</a></strong> to help you realize your initiative. And because this Community Fund belongs to all PART holders, it needs their approval to draw funds from it.</p><p>Indeed, to incentivize more use of the CCS system by the community, the team is going to open up the Community Fund. All you’ll need to do to claim the funds is craft a clear proposal that requires a vote and explains your initiative in detail as well as why you need the funds. Then, you need to convince the Particl community to vote in favor of your proposal and approve the claim of funds.</p><h1 id=\"first-proposal-coming-in-on-wednesday-\">First Proposal Coming in on Wednesday!</h1><p>You won’t have to wait for too long to put on your first vote! As soon as this <strong>Wednesday (28th of April, 2021)</strong>, we will publish the first-ever proposal to require the use of the on-chain voting system.<br><br>This proposal, which was widely requested by the community, seeks to nominate the Particl team as managers of the manual claim process required to unfreeze all legitimate anon and blind coins. These coins are currently frozen as part of the emergency hardfork deployed by the team weeks ago and they need to be re-enabled as smoothly as possible. Keep an eye out on Particl News and the CCS on Wednesday for all the details on the proposal!</p><hr><p>With the support of the on-chain voting system as well as the upcoming few proposals, the Particl project is entering a brand new phase that emphasizes the power of the community much more. If you’ve ever had a great idea for a project, business, or service you think would benefit the Particl ecosystem, you’ll have all the tools you need to make it happen, if you can convince the community!</p><p>This addition to the CCS marks a significant milestone for the project and should lead to many more community contributions than we’ve ever seen. Don’t forget, if the decentralized treasury model proposal is approved, the Community Fund is also going to grow in value and, if the price of PART increases, will grow exponentially in value, opening even more doors. This has tremendous potential and we can’t wait to see what you, the community, will create with these resources!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

financially and legally\nsupported by a Swiss non-profit Foundation; the Particl Foundation. This legal\nentity has served the purpose of funding the development and management of\nParticl as well as supporting the project legally using funds that it raised\nfrom the community in 2017.\n\nAs of November 2020, after slightly more than three years, the Particl\nFoundation has run out of the funds it raised from community donations and as\nsuch, has initiated its shutdown process. A mandatory closure audit is currently\nunderway.\n\nAs a result, the Particl team has since then voluntarily supported the project\nsince no funds are available anymore to pay for salaries, expenses, and fund\ndevelopment and initiatives.\n\nWith today's fast-paced and rapidly evolving blockchain industry, any serious\nproject needs to have enough funding to support its ecosystem, promote its\nproduct(s), and grow its community. Equally important is the necessity to have\nlegal representation so that the project can effectively and safely interact\nwith other parties, manage funds, and own assets (i.e., servers). Without any of\nthis, projects expose themselves to being overrun by competitors who don’t have\nthe same financial struggles.\n\nTo address this critical issue, the Particl team has consulted with a few\nadvisors and community leaders and put together a proposal for a new \ndecentralized treasury model that, if approved by the Particl community, could \nbring enough funding to self-sustain the project at current prices, boost\ncommunity resources, and provide a brand new legal entity to support the project\n.\n\nThis blog post will explain, in full detail, every aspect of the new\ndecentralized treasury model; how it works, its benefits and its parameters.\nThis is a first step aimed at getting you familiarized with the proposed idea.\n\nThen, in a separate blog post that will be published in the next few days on\nParticl News, we will publish a full breakdown of how the Particl team intends\nto claim and use those funds, restructure the project, stimulate the community\nand bring the Particl ecosystem to the next level in all aspects.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Contents\n * The Proposal in Short\n * Proposal Approval and Treasury Governance\n * Funding CCS Initiatives With a Community Fund\n * Additional Benefits\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Proposal in Short\nThis decentralized treasury model proposal, which is closely modelled after that\nof successful projects such as Siacoin and Decred, aims at firing up and\nexpanding Particl into a stronger-than-ever ecosystem by generating more PART\nthat can be put to use to the benefit of the project. The Particl team would\nthen claim funds from this treasury by pushing CCS proposals either quarterly or\nbi-annually.\n\nTo preserve a good level of decentralization and ensure community consensus, the\nintroduction of this new treasury model requires approval from the community\nthrough an on-chain voting process that’s going to be opened up in the days to\ncome. If approved, the modifications necessary to activate the new treasury\nmodel will be included in the upcoming hardfork that re-enables RingCT and CT\ntransactions.\n\nSelf-Sustainability—The Numbers in Detail\n * Circulating supply post-hardfork (estimate): ~11,750,000 PART\n * Proposed yearly inflation rate: 8%\n * Proposed treasury block rewards: 50%\n * Proposed total yearly staking rate (APR for stakers): 4%\n * Proposed yearly treasury rewards (estimates): 470,000 PART\n * Monthly treasury rewards (averaged from estimates): 39,166 PART\n\n> Note: If the proposal is approed, the current 10% “development staking reward”\nis going to be abolished in profit of the new decentralized treasury model.\nIn summary, the proposal for this new decentralized treasury model suggests\nincreasing the yearly inflation rate from 2% to 8% for two years and then \ndecreasing it by 1% every two years until it reaches 6% and stays at that level.\nEvery time the network stakes a block, 50% of the block rewards would then be\nredistributed to stakers and 50% into the Treasury Fund to fund, support,\npromote, and grow the project. That amounts to 4% of the total circulating\nsupply every year.\n\nThis brings the yearly PART staking interest (APY) to a minimum of 4%. Because\nAPY depends on how many coins in total are staking on the network, the true APY\nalways ends up being higher than its minimum rate. For example, if 50% of all\nthe PART coins are staking on the network, the staking APY goes from 4% to\naround 8% yearly.\n\nThis proposed treasury model is all about self-sustainability. Indeed, it\nprovides enough funding in PART to the project to cover salaries for the core\nteam, pay for all related expenses, and fund various promotional budgets at\ncurrent (and lower) PART prices. It also gives the extra resources required to\nexpand the team with more talents and add more expertise to the table. More\ndetails on the internal restructuring of the team and how it intends to claim\nand use those funds will be provided in a separate blog post published in a few\ndays on Particl News.\n\nDuring its first year, the Treasury Fund would earn an average of 39,166 PART\nevery month. This is sufficient, at current price levels of PART = $1, to\nsustain the project and fund various initiatives to take Particl to the next\nlevel. The proposed model is viable down to a PART price of around $0.50.\n\nOf course, the Treasury Fund exclusively gets funded with PART. An increase in\nthe trading value of the coin would then make the incoming revenue more valuable\nin fiat, allowing the team to expand further, fund more initiatives/programs,\nstimulate the community to a greater degree, and accelerate the growth of the\nentire ecosystem even more. For this reason, the Treasury Fund has exponential\ngrowth potential, but it's also important to note that a reduction in the price\nof PART can also have an adverse effect.\n\nProposal Approval and Treasury Governance\nThe Particl team has long been looking to decentralize the project further and\nput more power into the hands of the community. That’s the true spirit of\nblockchain technology, after all, and this is precisely what this new\ndecentralized treasury model achieves.\n\nAs such, this new treasury model is being suggested as a CCS proposal and\nrequires community approval to be set in motion. If the vote passes and the\nproposal is approved, the new treasury model will be put in place in the\nupcoming hardfork.\n\nAs for the governance of the Treasury Fund itself, you, the community, will have\nthe final say over it. To claim funds from it, the Particl team will publish CCS\nproposals every quarter or on a bi-annual basis, depending on a few factors at\nthe time the proposals are published. These proposals will detail how the funds\nare intended to be used, the objectives for the claim period, and what to expect\nin terms of deliverables.\n\nAs mentioned earlier in this blog post, the Particl team will publish shortly a\nseparate blog post exclusively focused on explaining how it will be restructured\nin light of this new decentralized governance (including a brand new legal\nentity), how it intends to claim and use funds moving forward, as well as its\nobjectives and deliverables.\n\nCommunity Governance and On-Chain Voting\nTo approve CCS proposals and claims of funds, the community will be invited to\nvote through the on-chain voting mechanism built into Particl Core. This voting\nsystem uses staking weight, meaning the number of coins being staked, as voting\ntickets. The more coins you stake on the Particl network, the greater your voice\nin these voting events.\n\nIt is possible to vote using clients such as Particl CLI, Particl Desktop, and\nParticl-Qt, but the best way to do it is through Particl’s cold staking\napplication Partyman. To facilitate the process of voting, a GUI integration has\nbeen added to the CCS, effectively tying proposals to on-chain voting events.\n\nMore information about the on-chain voting system, including the consensus and\nquorum requirements, will also be published in a separate blog post focused on\nthe on-chain voting scheduled for in a few days on Particl News.\n\nFunding CCS Initiatives With a Community Fund\nThe implementation of the treasury model, combined with the on-chain voting\nsystem integration into the CCS, will also enable brand-new opportunities at the\ncommunity level. Every month, a number of PART coins coming from the\ndecentralized treasury fund will be sent into a community-governed fund.\n\nThis Community Fund\n[https://explorer.particl.io/address/RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM], which\nalready contains ~25,818 PART coins as a result of unclaimed PART during the\ncoin swap event in 2017, will be made available to the community to be used to\nfund CCS initiatives. For an initiative to be funded by the Community Fund, it\nneeds to first go through a voting process, reach a voting quorum (minimum\nnumber of coins having voted), and approval rate. If that is achieved, then the\nproposal is officially approved by the community. According to the milestone\nschedule, the correct number of coins will be sent from the Community Fund to\nthe initiative’s custodian.\n\nAdditional Benefits\nWhile this blog post simply exclusively intends on explaining the decentralized\ntreasury model proposal, here are some of the benefits it will provide to the\nproject if approved. Of course, much more information on that end will be\npublished in the blog post that will explain how the team intends on using those\nfunds coming in just a few days.\n\n * Complete restructuring of the team’s internal processes, management,\n   leadership, and communications (internal and external).\n * Team expansion as price and market situation permits.\n * More active and rapid development as well as a more constant release\n   schedule.\n * More regular, streamlined, and transparent communication/updates.\n * More active, engaged, and blooming community and ecosystem.\n * More focus on deliverables other than Particl Core, the marketplace, and\n   Particl Desktop.\n * Renewed efforts in getting listed on more prominent exchanges.\n * More financial and human resources to market Particl’s products (i.e. PART\n   coin, Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap DEX, etc.)\n * Many more promotional and user acquisition initiatives.\n * And more…\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe hope that you are as excited as we are about this proposal. It has the power\nto significantly change things around and give the project the spark it needs to\nget the exposure, recognition, resources, and workforce behind it that it\ndeserves.\n\nAs we finally move ahead with a lot of what's been in the works for the last\nweeks, keep an eye out on Particl News and the CCS this week and the next one.\nWe will start publishing lots of new content including follow-up blog posts and\nthe CCS proposals. We invite you to take part in the discussion related to these\nproposals in their respective comment section on the CCS as they get published.\n\nLet’s get this proposal approved, and let’s take Particl to a whole new level!\n\n> The Particl team\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

The Particl team would then claim funds from this treasury by pushing CCS proposals either quarterly or bi-annually.</p><p>To preserve a good level of decentralization and ensure community consensus, the introduction of this new treasury model requires approval from the community through an on-chain voting process that’s going to be opened up in the days to come.

Every time the network stakes a block,<strong> 50% of the block rewards</strong> would then be redistributed to stakers and <strong>50% into the Treasury Fund</strong> to fund, support, promote, and grow the project. That amounts to 4% of the total circulating supply every year.</p><p>This brings the <strong>yearly PART staking interest (APY) to a minimum of 4%</strong>. Because APY depends on how many coins in total are staking on the network, the true APY always ends up being higher than its minimum rate. For example, <strong>if 50%</strong> of all the PART coins are staking on the network, the <strong>staking</strong> <strong>APY goes from 4% to around 8% yearly</strong>.</p><p>This proposed treasury model is all about self-sustainability. Indeed, it provides enough funding in PART to the project to cover salaries for the core team, pay for all related expenses, and fund various promotional budgets at current (and lower) PART prices. It also gives the extra resources required to expand the team with more talents and add more expertise to the table. More details on the internal restructuring of the team and how it intends to claim and use those funds will be provided in a separate blog post published in a few days on Particl News.</p><p>During its first year, the Treasury Fund would earn an <strong>average of 39,166 PART every month</strong>. This is sufficient, at current price levels of PART = $1, to sustain the project and fund various initiatives to take Particl to the next level. The proposed model is viable down to a PART price of around $0.50.</p><p>Of course, the Treasury Fund exclusively gets funded with PART. An increase in the trading value of the coin would then make the incoming revenue more valuable in fiat, allowing the team to expand further, fund more initiatives/programs, stimulate the community to a greater degree, and accelerate the growth of the entire ecosystem even more.

The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News.
