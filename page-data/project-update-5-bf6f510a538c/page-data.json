Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\nWill it be possible to cold vote with funds stored on a Ledger Nano S?\nYes. Though the feature is not available at the moment, it will be possible to\nuse the project governance and marketplace governance systems even with coins\nthat have their private keys stored on a Ledger Nano S. This feature will be\npart of our future Ledger integration onto Particl Desktop, but we cannot give\nany kind of ETA for the moment as it is not an immediate focus for any of our\ndevelopment team. We believe those users looking for the highest amount of\nsecurity shouldn’t be penalized and taken out of the democratic process of the\nParticl community.\n\nWill Particl be added on Coinbase?\nImran, our Commercial & Partner Strategy Director, is always on the lookout for\nnew exchanges as well as regularly keeping in touch with the more popular ones.\nThere is a lot of back and forth going on at any moment with many exchanges and\nare positive that the interest for the Particl project is growing within the\n“exchange community” as we ourselves are slowly nearing the release of the\nmarketplace (which would be our biggest milestone to date) and putting our money\nwhere our mouth is in terms of development. We cannot and will never, however,\ntell anyone in advance of a listing agreement before we officially and publicly\nannounce it.\n\nWe have currently adjusted our strategy to mostly focus on the larger and more\nprofessional exchanges, those we believe are in it for the long run and have a\nsolid legal foundation. We, of course, welcome smaller or new exchanges to list\nus, and we have no problem providing development support to those, but we might\nnot go ahead and pay the listing fees anymore.\n\nAs for Coinbase more specifically, we know they have started adding new coins\nand will work on seizing that opportunity!\n\nWill private listings be able to be governed by the community?\nBoth public and private listings will be governable by the community\nexclusively, however, as private listings do not appear on the public interface\nof the marketplace, they are expected to be much more unlikely to be voted out\nby the community unless it leaks to the public or creates a controversy.\n\nThat is because listings need to reach a certain user flagging threshold to be\ntaken out of the marketplace, and since private listings are hidden to the\nentire public except for those in possession of its unique key or link, this\nthreshold should be much harder to reach.\n\nThis will ensure users can still transact privately between each other and do so\naway from the public eye, but should the transacted content be highly\ninappropriate and leaked out, the community will still possess the ability to\nclean its marketplace from it.\n\nAs for one on one private deals where the private keys never leak to any other\nparty other than the ones involved, they simply won’t be possible to moderate\nout as the flagging threshold for the deletion of listings will be set too high\nfor any or both parties to singlehandedly have enough governing influence over\nit.\n\nWhen I do a search on Google for decentralized marketplaces, other projects show\nup on the first page, but not Particl. Why is that and what are the team’s\nthoughts about this?\nWe believe there are many reasons for it. For one, we are a very young project,\nat least compared to some of the decentralized marketplace projects out there,\nhaving only been “live” on mainnet since the 17th of July 2017. It also could be\ndue to our relatively smaller community size. In fact, having a smaller\ncommunity, and especially one that resides mostly on instant messaging platforms\nsuch as Discord or Telegram, generates fewer discussions about the project on\nthe web, which in turn makes us harder for the search engine algorithms to pick\nup.\n\nIt’s also important not to forget that Particl is not merely a decentralized\nmarketplace, but a full-blown privacy-focused decentralized application\nplatform. This means that our community discussions are not only focused on the\ndecentralized marketplace aspect of the project but also stretch into our many\nother perks and related topics such as cold staking, dApps, RingCT, privacy,\nsecurity, and etc. This is in contrast with other “competitors” (quotes have\nbeen added as we strongly believe we are carving our very own niche category of\nblockchains) that focus exclusively on decentralized eCommerce. The fact we are\nbuilding Particl to be much more than a marketplace, we believe, is one of our\nstrongest quality and while it may result in less focused and more diversified\ndiscussions, it will ultimately allow us to reach out to a more a diverse set of\nusers.\n\nFollowing a similar train of thought, we are also very cautious about not\nheavily promoting aspects of the project that is still in deep stages of\ndevelopment as delays and unforeseen issues can always arise, especially when\nbuilding a platform as complex as Particl is.\n\nWhile this is most probably about to change as we near the completion of the\nfirst mainnet version of Particl Marketplace, the above reasons might have\ncontributed in part to Particl being harder to find when referencing\ndecentralized marketplace discussions. Getting better search results will\nrequire time, more updates, users, and web-based discussions. The latter, for\nexample, is expected to dramatically improve as we are just about to release our\nforum. We, in fact, believe that it will help carry some of the great\ndiscussions going on over on the instant messaging platforms to an indexable and\nweb-based platform. Please see the dedicated forum section of this update\nfurther down the page.\n\nA while ago, there was a Twitter poll about stable coins. Wouldn’t integrating\nany of these hinder user’s privacy and usability by requiring KYC/AML\nidentifications? Wouldn’t that defeat the entire purpose of the Particl project?\nIt is true that some stable coins (or any potential third-party integration)\nrequire KYC/AML identification of users on their end to be utilized to their\nfull potential, however, it is not going to be something that is required for\nthe Particl platform to provide any of its critical features.\n\nFor clarification purposes, this poll was meant as a fun way for us to get to\nknow our community better. Stable coins, like the poll’s winner Digix, possess\nthe interesting ability to maintain some kind of stable valuation (i.e. 1 DGX =\n1g of physical gold, 1 USDt = ~1 USD, and etc). This can be super useful for\npeople wishing to opt out of the fiat system, but also avoid the volatility\nusually associated with the cryptocurrency market.\n\nRest assured, any non-PART Particl Marketplace transaction still needs to, and\nwill always need to, be settled in PART as it requires the coin’s RingCT\ncapabilities to protect users’ privacy and also because the marketplace’s MAD\nescrow system is based on a Particl smart-contract that can only work using PART\ncoins similarly to how Ether is the fuel for Ethereum-based smart-contracts and\nis required for them to execute.\n\nStable coins, in the case of Particl, are very interesting because they allow\nusers to get the best of both the fiat and crypto world: an arguably stable\nmeans to store value that can be readily be spent on anything available on the\nParticl Marketplace. In that sense, both the marketplace and stable coins give\neach other a great use-case that comes very close to an eCommerce experience\nregular people are used to dealing with.\n\nNote that it is possible for third-party integrations to require KYC/AML\nidentifications, but that will always we offered as an option and will never be\nmandatory as that would directly go against our mission and what we stand for.\n\nIs the team aware of the Nothing-At-Stake attack on PoS consensus algorithms and\nif so, how does it intend to fix this vulnerability?\nYes, the team is very aware of this often-promoted-by-PoW-advocates\nvulnerability of the Proof-of-Stake algorithm and has implemented checkpoints to\nmitigate this issue. We recommend joining the Open Development channel on\nDiscord and chat with our developer Kewde to get more in-depth insights about\nhow we have designed the Particl blockchain to be protected against this attack\nprecisely.\n\nIs the RingCT protocol ready for mainnet or does it still requires some tweaks\nas indicated by either the NJIT Department of Technology academic report or\nWSA’s security audit?\nYes, both the academic report and security audit have indicated that no issue\nwas found with our Bitcoin-based implementation of the RingCT protocol. As many\nof you already know, this implementation has been on testnet ever since we\nlaunched Particl on the 17th of July 2017 and thus is virtually ready for\nmainnet implementation.\n\nNote that, as the RingCT hardfork will be combined (subject to change) with the\nmarketplace governance one, it will have to wait until the latter is ready for\nmainnet implementation. It will be announced several weeks in advance for users\nto be aware of it coming.\n\nIs RingCT on marketplace transactions a requirement for Particl Marketplace\nmainnet?\nMost likely. RingCT is tentatively planned on being hardforked at the same time\nas the marketplace governance system which is an absolute requirement for the\nmarketplace to be released on mainnet. We have started to look into\nBulletproofs, which is the RingCT/CT protocol improvement that should reduce\nprivacy transaction sizes by about 80%, and might even add it to the hardfork.\n\nThe first step to enhancing our escrow system is to put CT on it, then shifting\nto RingCT should be pretty easy. Ultimately, the only absolute requirement for\nthe marketplace is the governance system, and it would be unlikely that it would\nrelease without RingCT escrow as well, instead putting CT on the marketplace for\na while, but this is not out of the question neither. We will keep you updated\nabout this as we know more.\n\nWhat is MOIN? Why are they looking into forking the Particl codebase and what\nimpact would that carry for the Particl project?\nMOIN is a small hobby project which is not associated in any way with the\nParticl team but their lead developer is on good terms with our Lead Graphic &\nBranding Designer CRZ. MOIN was started as a Shadowcash fork and just like we\ndid in the past, probably realize how outdated this codebase is getting.\n\nWhile we haven’t really received any information from them as of late, we did\nsuggest to them that they increase their supply when hardforking and airdrop it\nto Particl holders as a token of appreciation and to cross-pollinate both\ncommunities.\n\nWhat makes Particl better than its competition?\nParticl has a lot of things going for it. One very important aspect is the fact\nthat we have a coin which a community can rally behind. This is missing from\nOpenBazaar, which we believe they might start seeing the use of having one as\nthey are planning on integrating some kind of token to their decentralized\nmarketplace.\n\nBut the most important factors which makes us much different than any of our\ncompetitors is our focus on both security, privacy, and true decentralization\nwithout compromise. In fact, in the case of Syscoin’s Blockmarket marketplace,\nit is moderated by the Syscoin staff itself and in the case of OpenBazaar, they\nemploy moderators. Both of these competitors also make use of a centralized form\nof escrow which not only makes the platforms less scalable (more people need to\nbe hired or moderating as the more users start using these platforms), but it\nalso leaves the door wide open for collusion between a staff member or escrow\nagent and one of the parties involved.\n\nWhile it may seem unlikely that a third-party would collude with another party,\nit is actually more common than it seems. It is also possible for a third-party\nto make a wrong or bad decision when the participants of a marketplace\ntransaction that’s been put in “conflict” cannot agree on any resolution or if\none of them is lying to the escrow agent. There are countless examples where\nmoderated deals can go bad, and we’d rather put 100% of the responsibility to\nthe participating users themselves rather than a moderating party.\n\nFor a more detailed breakdown of Particl’s advantages over its competitors, you\ncan refer back to a Reddit post made by Cryptoguard here: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/8k3kv2/what_are_the_competitive_advantages_of_particl/dz559jr\n\nAre there any plans on sending more Particl team members to more conferences\nand meetups?\nAbsolutely! When we went to this year’s edition of the Consensus Conference, we\nnoticed that we were one of the only projects with an actual product to show\nfor, even though only on its Alpha version. This, in turn, attracted a lot of\nattention from the conference’s participants and we also were quite impressed by\nthe number of people that actually knew about what we were building. This tells\nus that we need to have an increased presence in conferences as the sentiment we\nreceived from our short time in Consensus was quite positive.\n\nOur budget is, however, quite limited for now as we are in a deep development\nphase and more focused on hiring developers to release our product than hyping\n“vaporware”. Sending team members and representatives to conferences,\ncrypto-themed, and others will definitely be part of our budget once we go\nthrough our Primary Funding Round where we aim to raise much more capital than\nwe did during the coin swap.\n\nWe would, nonetheless, support any community member desiring to present Particl\nin meetups or conferences. If you plan on attending or speaking to one such\nevent, let us know and we will assist you with material and look into what you\nwould need to make the presentation more impactful. Don’t hesitate to contact\nPaul Schmitzer, our Communications Manager, or Cryptoguard, our Community\nManager, if you are interested.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nLedger Staking Tutorial is Now Available!\nWe announced on the 7th of August that Particl was finally able to be managed\nfrom Ledger Nano S hardware devices, with cold staking enabled. However, at the\ntime of the announcement, no tutorial on how to enable hardware cold staking was\navailable. This changed on the 17th of August when we officially published a\nproper tutorial on how to activate cold staking on these devices, making Particl\nthe world’s safest Proof-of-Stake protocol. To enable your Ledger Nano S\nhardware device for cold staking, simply follow the steps included in this\ntutorial: https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking\n\nNote: While this tutorial is pretty straight-forward, it may be reserved for the\nmore advanced users. If you do not want to mess with the debug window or some of\nthe more advanced features of the Particl blockchain, it is recommended that you\nwait for the Particl Desktop integration which will come at a later time.\n\nNew Particl Desktop Developer’s First Commit\nAs mentioned a few times already, we hired a new developer in July to lead and\noversee the development of our Particl Desktop client (as well as potentially\nworking on Particl Copay), the centerpiece of the Particl platform, starting on\nAugust 1st, 2018. He has now started reviewing our entire Particl Desktop code\nand has even pushed his first commit\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1113], a rather large one, on\nGithub which shows great professionalism. In fact, zaSmilingIdiot\n[https://github.com/zaSmilingIdiot] has a lot of experience working with large\nteams of developers and his work methodology will surely be a great asset to our\nproject and its development pace. Consult his first PR by following this link: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1113\n\nIt is worth noting that, whenever you log into Github and consult pull requests,\nGithub will indicate you, upon consulting at a later time, of the new changes\nand updates made to the pull request since the last time you looked at it. This\ncan be quite useful when tracking the development progress of the project.\n\nPull Request Updates IndicatorNew Status Report Published Includes New Exciting\nDevelopments\nSpeaking of development, we’ve published on the 20th of August a new Status\nReport showing the project’s progress. While it contains similar items as our\nlast Status Report, several of them have been moved to the “Waiting for Review”\ncategory, meaning they’ve been completed and are undergoing the final testing\nphase. These items include Particl Desktop 1.2.2 (which is already available to\nanyone as a stable mainnet pre-release\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2]) and the\nlong-awaited marketplace governance system (version 1.0). If all the testing\ngoes well, we should see the governance mechanism appear in some form or the\nother on Particl Marketplace Alpha (can be downloaded here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2]) in the coming\nweeks.\n\nStaking Pools Incoming!\nOne of the biggest takeaway one can get from our latest Status Report is the\ninclusion of staking pool related features in the “In Development” category.\nThis is directly in relation to our commitment to offer secure but accessible\noptions to ALL of our users and will also potentially strengthen the Particl\nnetwork by incentivizing even more users to run their own node. In fact,\nTecnovert, our Core Lead Developer, has started working on a cold staking pool\nproof-of-concept that would allow any user to stake their funds and receive\nconstant rewards regardless of the amount they hold. As it currently stands,\nanyone, big or small holder, can put up their funds for staking, but those with\nsmaller balances may find the process impractical as staking rewards are paid in\n~1.24 PART increments. A user holding only 50 PART, for example, would need to\nwait several months in between staking rewards.\n\nWith a staking pool, anyone can dedicate their staking powers to a staking pool\nwhich has the ability to send out staking reward payments in smaller increments,\nsimilarly to how proof-of-work mining pools allow multiple users to pool up\ntheir hashing powers to receive smaller but more numerous payments.\n\nMore details about this feature will be given at a later time.\n\nMarketplace and Project Governance are About to Hit Testnet!\nOur governance mechanisms have seen a lot of progress being made to them in the\nlast few weeks, and are now imminently reaching a point where they will start\nbeing integrated onto our testnet network for community testing. This will mark\na very important milestone in the development of the Particl project, and can be\ntentatively expected for the new few weeks.\n\nWe hope to get as many testers as possible as the more people test these\nfeatures, the more effectively we can identify bugs, improvements to be made,\nand such, which in turns can result in these features hitting mainnet more\nquickly. These are exciting times for the project and the pieces are starting to\nfall into place!\n\nA New Video Showing the Impressive Amount of Work Put Into Particl Since its\nInception\nToday we want to give you guys a sneak peek of a blog post that will likely come\nout next week. Using an open-source Github activity analysis tool, we were able\nto produce a mindblowing video highlighting the mindblowing amount of work that\nour development team has put into Particl since its inception.\n\nIn this video, the users moving around are blockchain developers. Those with\ntheir names written in green are Particl developers, and those with their names\nwritten in grey are Bitcoin developers. It highlights several of our development\nrepositories (meaning repos like Particl.io, Branding, Whitepaper, and such are\nexcluded), including Particl Core, Particl Desktop, Particl Market, OMP-Lib, and\nother repos instrumental to the development of the project.\n\nIt is particularly interesting to not only see how relentless our developers are\nregardless of the overall cryptocurrency market situation but also how keeping\nour codebase up-to-date with the latest Bitcoin Core version positively impacts\nthe project. In fact, while Bitcoin Core developers do not work on Particl Core\nat all, their work on the Bitcoin codebase is still reflected on ours, granting\nus all the latest performance, stability, security, and usability developments\nmade over Bitcoin Core. More videos, including isolated repositories such as\nParticl Desktop, will be posted in a coming dedicated blog post. Stay tuned!\n\nThe PIVX-Particl Alliance Voting Round is an Overwhelming Success!\nWe announced not too long ago that we had struck an agreement with the PIVX\ncommunity to set up a vote for an alliance where they would get listed to the\nParticl Marketplace (as with every other coins, non-PART Particl Marketplace\ntransactions still need to be ultimately settled in PART) and we would get\nlisted on zDEX. Then, both marketing/social media teams would collaborate\ntogether for some cross-promotion, promoting privacy, security, and\ndecentralization (more details here: \nhttps://forum.pivx.org/t/particl-application-for-pivx-alliance/4379).\n\nThe voting round has been initiated on PIVX’s end, and it is safe to say that\nthe proposal has been an overwhelming success! In fact, as it currently stands,\nthe votes are 330 in favor of the alliance, and 4 are against it. We are very\nhappy to see the PIVX community interested in joining forces with us and\ncooperate with a fellow privacy and decentralization-minded project! We take it\nas a huge stepping stone for cooperation between the two projects and maybe the\nstart of something bigger, as in more cooperation campaigns between the two\nprojects. As with everything-PIVX though, any further proposal will be required\nto be voted on by their community, but we are confident we may start seeing more\njoint proposals appearing in the future.\n\nTo track the proposal and its voting results, please follow this link: \nhttp://178.254.23.111/~pub/DN/DN_Info.html\n\nDownload and Use Particl Desktop 1.2.2 Before it is Released!\nRecently, most of the Particl Desktop development has been focused on the\nmarketplace, but its wallet functions have also undergone quite a few major\nchanges (and we fully expect the pace to pick up even more with our new Particl\nDesktop lead developer zaSmilingIdiot). In fact, you can download Particl\nDesktop 1.2.2 [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2] \ntoday in its pre-release but stable version. This new Particl Desktop version is\na major update on the mainnet wallet capabilities of Particl’s main client. A\nmajority of its user interface has been improved upon as well as made more\nuser-friendly and a lot of bugs and fixes were implemented to make the Particl\nDesktop experience as smooth as it has ever been!\n\nMore Updates Being Made to the Website\nOur official website, particl.io, is currently undergoing major changes and\nupdates. Indeed, Martin Allien, our UI/UX Front-End Developer, is currently\nrevamping most of its text in order to make it accessible and approachable to a\nwider audience as well as adding new information pages. One such page is Coin\nSpecifications [https://particl.io/coin-specifications/], a page entirely\ndedicated to giving a quick and to-the-point overview of the technical aspects\nof the Particl coin and blockchain.\n\nTo see all the latest changes made to the website, you can follow its commits on\nGithub here: https://github.com/particl/particl.io/commits/master\n\nForum Update\nAlmost everything is ready to be released, but we are still resolving the final\nemail issue which renders forum registration difficult. In most cases,\nconfirmation emails (any email sent from the forum, for that matter) will either\nnot reach the user’s inbox or directly land in the spam folder, a behavior which\nisn’t up to speed with what we want to offer our community.\n\nIf you wish, however, to test it out before it is revealed and give us some\nfeedback, do not hesitate to contact Cryptoguard on either Telegram or Discord\nand he will send you the link as well as instructions on how to receive the\nregistration email.\n\nBitcoinTalk Opening Post Being Revamped\nAt the same time as we are going over some of the aspects of our website, we are\nalso working on refreshing our BitcoinTalk opening post as it is now severely\noutdated. Speaking of BitcoinTalk, we do believe that it needs to be more\nactive. In fact, every time a comment is posted in it, it bumps the thread to\nthe top of the list, thus giving us more exposure, if only for a brief moment.\nWe are looking into some ways to make it more active, including linking the\nthread to a Discord room or to a Particl forum megathread. Linking the BCT\nthread to some other medium is not an immediate priority but will be something\nwe will start looking into more seriously after we officially release the forum.\n\nParticl is on Mastodon\nDid you know of Mastodon? It is an open-source and decentralized social media\nplatform on which we have an account registered on. Make sure to give us a\nfollow for yet another way to keep yourself up-to-date with all the latest news\nsurrounding the project by following the link here: \nhttps://mastodon.social/@particl\n\nWhat is Satoshi Citadel Industries?\nWe posted yesterday an interview with Miguel Cunetta, one of our key advisor,\nwhere he explains what is Satoshi Citadel Industries.

We, of course, welcome smaller or new exchanges to list us, and we have no problem providing development support to those, but we might not go ahead and pay the listing fees anymore.</p><p>As for Coinbase more specifically, we know they have started adding new coins and will work on seizing that opportunity!</p><h3 id=\"will-private-listings-be-able-to-be-governed-by-the-community\">Will private listings be able to be governed by the community?</h3><p>Both public and private listings will be governable by the community exclusively, however, as private listings do not appear on the public interface of the marketplace, they are expected to be much more unlikely to be voted out by the community unless it leaks to the public or creates a controversy.</p><p>That is because listings need to reach a certain user flagging threshold to be taken out of the marketplace, and since private listings are hidden to the entire public except for those in possession of its unique key or link, this threshold should be much harder to reach.</p><p>This will ensure users can still transact privately between each other and do so away from the public eye, but should the transacted content be highly inappropriate and leaked out, the community will still possess the ability to clean its marketplace from it.</p><p>As for one on one private deals where the private keys never leak to any other party other than the ones involved, they simply won’t be possible to moderate out as the flagging threshold for the deletion of listings will be set too high for any or both parties to singlehandedly have enough governing influence over it.</p><h3 id=\"when-i-do-a-search-on-google-for-decentralized-marketplaces-other-projects-show-up-on-the-first-page-but-not-particl-why-is-that-and-what-are-the-team-s-thoughts-about-this\">When I do a search on Google for decentralized marketplaces, other projects show up on the first page, but not Particl. Why is that and what are the team’s thoughts about this?</h3><p>We believe there are many reasons for it. For one, we are a very young project, at least compared to some of the decentralized marketplace projects out there, having only been “live” on mainnet since the 17th of July 2017. It also could be due to our relatively smaller community size. In fact, having a smaller community, and especially one that resides mostly on instant messaging platforms such as Discord or Telegram, generates fewer discussions about the project on the web, which in turn makes us harder for the search engine algorithms to pick up.</p><p>It’s also important not to forget that Particl is not merely a decentralized marketplace, but a full-blown privacy-focused decentralized application platform. This means that our community discussions are not only focused on the decentralized marketplace aspect of the project but also stretch into our many other perks and related topics such as cold staking, dApps, RingCT, privacy, security, and etc. This is in contrast with other “competitors” (quotes have been added as we strongly believe we are carving our very own niche category of blockchains) that focus exclusively on decentralized eCommerce. The fact we are building Particl to be much more than a marketplace, we believe, is one of our strongest quality and while it may result in less focused and more diversified discussions, it will ultimately allow us to reach out to a more a diverse set of users.</p><p>Following a similar train of thought, we are also very cautious about not heavily promoting aspects of the project that is still in deep stages of development as delays and unforeseen issues can always arise, especially when building a platform as complex as Particl is.</p><p>While this is most probably about to change as we near the completion of the first mainnet version of Particl Marketplace, the above reasons might have contributed in part to Particl being harder to find when referencing decentralized marketplace discussions. Getting better search results will require time, more updates, users, and web-based discussions. The latter, for example, is expected to dramatically improve as we are just about to release our forum. We, in fact, believe that it will help carry some of the great discussions going on over on the instant messaging platforms to an indexable and web-based platform. <strong>Please see the dedicated forum section of this update further down the page.</strong></p><h3 id=\"a-while-ago-there-was-a-twitter-poll-about-stable-coins-wouldn-t-integrating-any-of-these-hinder-user-s-privacy-and-usability-by-requiring-kyc-aml-identifications-wouldn-t-that-defeat-the-entire-purpose-of-the-particl-project\">A while ago, there was a Twitter poll about stable coins. Wouldn’t integrating any of these hinder user’s privacy and usability by requiring KYC/AML identifications? Wouldn’t that defeat the entire purpose of the Particl project?</h3><p>It is true that some stable coins (or any potential third-party integration) require KYC/AML identification of users <strong>on their end </strong>to be utilized to their full potential, however, it is not going to be something that is required for the Particl platform to provide any of its critical features.</p><p>For clarification purposes, this poll was meant as a fun way for us to get to know our community better. Stable coins, like the poll’s winner Digix, possess the interesting ability to maintain some kind of stable valuation (i.e. 1 DGX = 1g of physical gold, 1 USDt = ~1 USD, and etc). This can be super useful for people wishing to opt out of the fiat system, but also avoid the volatility usually associated with the cryptocurrency market.</p><p>Rest assured, any non-PART Particl Marketplace transaction still needs to, and will always need to, be settled in PART as it requires the coin’s RingCT capabilities to protect users’ privacy and also because the marketplace’s MAD escrow system is based on a Particl smart-contract that can only work using PART coins similarly to how Ether is the fuel for Ethereum-based smart-contracts and is required for them to execute.</p><p>Stable coins, in the case of Particl, are very interesting because they allow users to get the best of both the fiat and crypto world: an arguably stable means to store value that can be readily be spent on anything available on the Particl Marketplace. In that sense, both the marketplace and stable coins give each other a great use-case that comes very close to an eCommerce experience regular people are used to dealing with.</p><p>Note that it is possible for third-party integrations to require KYC/AML identifications, but that will <strong>always</strong> we offered as an option and will <strong>never </strong>be mandatory as that would directly go against our mission and what we stand for.</p><h3 id=\"is-the-team-aware-of-the-nothing-at-stake-attack-on-pos-consensus-algorithms-and-if-so-how-does-it-intend-to-fix-this-vulnerability\">Is the team aware of the Nothing-At-Stake attack on PoS consensus algorithms and if so, how does it intend to fix this vulnerability?</h3><p>Yes, the team is very aware of this often-promoted-by-PoW-advocates vulnerability of the Proof-of-Stake algorithm and has implemented checkpoints to mitigate this issue. We recommend joining the Open Development channel on Discord and chat with our developer Kewde to get more in-depth insights about how we have designed the Particl blockchain to be protected against this attack precisely.</p><h3 id=\"is-the-ringct-protocol-ready-for-mainnet-or-does-it-still-requires-some-tweaks-as-indicated-by-either-the-njit-department-of-technology-academic-report-or-wsa-s-security-audit\">Is the RingCT protocol ready for mainnet or does it still requires some tweaks as indicated by either the NJIT Department of Technology academic report or WSA’s security audit?</h3><p>Yes, both the academic report and security audit have indicated that no issue was found with our Bitcoin-based implementation of the RingCT protocol. As many of you already know, this implementation has been on testnet ever since we launched Particl on the 17th of July 2017 and thus is virtually ready for mainnet implementation.</p><p>Note that, as the RingCT hardfork will be combined (subject to change) with the marketplace governance one, it will have to wait until the latter is ready for mainnet implementation. It will be announced several weeks in advance for users to be aware of it coming.</p><h3 id=\"is-ringct-on-marketplace-transactions-a-requirement-for-particl-marketplace-mainnet\">Is RingCT on marketplace transactions a requirement for Particl Marketplace mainnet?</h3><p>Most likely. RingCT is tentatively planned on being hardforked at the same time as the marketplace governance system which is an absolute requirement for the marketplace to be released on mainnet. We have started to look into Bulletproofs, which is the RingCT/CT protocol improvement that should reduce privacy transaction sizes by about 80%, and might even add it to the hardfork.</p><p>The first step to enhancing our escrow system is to put CT on it, then shifting to RingCT should be pretty easy. Ultimately, the only absolute requirement for the marketplace is the governance system, and it would be unlikely that it would release without RingCT escrow as well, instead putting CT on the marketplace for a while, but this is not out of the question neither. We will keep you updated about this as we know more.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-moin-why-are-they-looking-into-forking-the-particl-codebase-and-what-impact-would-that-carry-for-the-particl-project\">What is MOIN? Why are they looking into forking the Particl codebase and what impact would that carry for the Particl project?</h3><p>MOIN is a small hobby project which is not associated in any way with the Particl team but their lead developer is on good terms with our Lead Graphic &amp; Branding Designer CRZ. MOIN was started as a Shadowcash fork and just like we did in the past, probably realize how outdated this codebase is getting.</p><p>While we haven’t really received any information from them as of late, we did suggest to them that they increase their supply when hardforking and airdrop it to Particl holders as a token of appreciation and to cross-pollinate both communities.</p><h3 id=\"what-makes-particl-better-than-its-competition\">What makes Particl better than its competition?</h3><p>Particl has a lot of things going for it. One very important aspect is the fact that we have a coin which a community can rally behind. This is missing from OpenBazaar, which we believe they might start seeing the use of having one as they are planning on integrating some kind of token to their decentralized marketplace.</p><p>But the most important factors which makes us much different than <strong>any </strong>of our competitors is our focus on both security, privacy, and true decentralization without compromise. In fact, in the case of Syscoin’s Blockmarket marketplace, it is moderated by the Syscoin staff itself and in the case of OpenBazaar, they employ moderators. Both of these competitors also make use of a centralized form of escrow which not only makes the platforms less scalable (more people need to be hired or moderating as the more users start using these platforms), but it also leaves the door wide open for collusion between a staff member or escrow agent and one of the parties involved.</p><p>While it may seem unlikely that a third-party would collude with another party, it is actually more common than it seems. It is also possible for a third-party to make a wrong or bad decision when the participants of a marketplace transaction that’s been put in “conflict” cannot agree on any resolution or if one of them is lying to the escrow agent. There are countless examples where moderated deals can go bad, and we’d rather put 100% of the responsibility to the participating users themselves rather than a moderating party.</p><p>For a more detailed breakdown of Particl’s advantages over its competitors, you can refer back to a Reddit post made by Cryptoguard here: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/8k3kv2/what_are_the_competitive_advantages_of_particl/dz559jr\">https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/8k3kv2/what_are_the_competitive_advantages_of_particl/dz559jr</a></p><h3 id=\"are-there-any-plans-on-sending-more-particl-team-members-to-more-conferences-and-meetups\">Are there any plans on sending more Particl team members to more conferences and meetups?</h3><p>Absolutely! When we went to this year’s edition of the Consensus Conference, we noticed that we were one of the only projects with an actual product to show for, even though only on its Alpha version. This, in turn, attracted a lot of attention from the conference’s participants and we also were quite impressed by the number of people that actually knew about what we were building. This tells us that we need to have an increased presence in conferences as the sentiment we received from our short time in Consensus was quite positive.</p><p>Our budget is, however, quite limited for now as we are in a deep development phase and more focused on hiring developers to release our product than hyping “vaporware”. Sending team members and representatives to conferences, crypto-themed, and others will definitely be part of our budget once we go through our Primary Funding Round where we aim to raise much more capital than we did during the coin swap.</p><p>We would, nonetheless, support any community member desiring to present Particl in meetups or conferences. If you plan on attending or speaking to one such event, let us know and we will assist you with material and look into what you would need to make the presentation more impactful. Don’t hesitate to contact Paul Schmitzer, our Communications Manager, or Cryptoguard, our Community Manager, if you are interested.</p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &amp; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"ledger-staking-tutorial-is-now-available-\">Ledger Staking Tutorial is Now Available!</h3><p>We announced on the 7th of August that Particl was finally able to be managed from Ledger Nano S hardware devices, with cold staking enabled. However, at the time of the announcement, no tutorial on how to enable hardware cold staking was available. This changed on the 17th of August when we officially published a proper tutorial on how to activate cold staking on these devices, <strong>making Particl the world’s safest Proof-of-Stake protocol</strong>. To enable your Ledger Nano S hardware device for cold staking, simply follow the steps included in this tutorial: <a href=\"https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking\">https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking</a></p><p><em><strong>Note: </strong></em><em>While this tutorial is pretty straight-forward, it may be reserved for the more advanced users. If you do not want to mess with the debug window or some of the more advanced features of the Particl blockchain, it is recommended that you wait for the Particl Desktop integration which will come at a later time.</em></p><h3 id=\"new-particl-desktop-developer-s-first-commit\">New Particl Desktop Developer’s First Commit</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--5/1-pPTQ44Cy-aSYxa4DOKe8yw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>As mentioned a few times already, we hired a new developer in July to lead and oversee the development of our Particl Desktop client (as well as potentially working on Particl Copay), the centerpiece of the Particl platform, starting on August 1st, 2018. He has now started reviewing our entire Particl Desktop code and <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1113\">has even pushed his first commit</a>, a rather large one, on Github which shows great professionalism. In fact, <a href=\"https://github.com/zaSmilingIdiot\">zaSmilingIdiot</a> has a lot of experience working with large teams of developers and his work methodology will surely be a great asset to our project and its development pace. Consult his first PR by following this link: <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1113\">https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1113</a></p><p>It is worth noting that, whenever you log into Github and consult pull requests, Github will indicate you, upon consulting at a later time, of the new changes and updates made to the pull request since the last time you looked at it. This can be quite useful when tracking the development progress of the project.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--5/1-tL7afRrDjl94gy4OKkl6nQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Pull Request Updates Indicator</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"new-status-report-published-includes-new-exciting-developments\">New Status Report Published Includes New Exciting Developments</h3><p>Speaking of development, we’ve published on the 20th of August a new Status Report showing the project’s progress. While it contains similar items as our last Status Report, several of them have been moved to the “Waiting for Review” category, meaning they’ve been completed and are undergoing the final testing phase. These items include Particl Desktop 1.2.2 (<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2\">which is already available to anyone as a stable mainnet pre-release</a>) <strong>and the long-awaited marketplace governance system (version 1.0)</strong>. If all the testing goes well, we should see the governance mechanism appear in some form or the other on Particl Marketplace Alpha (<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2\">can be downloaded here</a>) in the coming weeks.</p><h3 id=\"staking-pools-incoming-\">Staking Pools Incoming!</h3><p>One of the biggest takeaway one can get from our latest Status Report is the inclusion of staking pool related features in the “In Development” category. This is directly in relation to our commitment to offer secure but accessible options to ALL of our users and will also potentially strengthen the Particl network by incentivizing even more users to run their own node. In fact, Tecnovert, our Core Lead Developer, has started working on a cold staking pool proof-of-concept that would allow any user to stake their funds and receive constant rewards regardless of the amount they hold. As it currently stands, anyone, big or small holder, can put up their funds for staking, but those with smaller balances may find the process impractical as staking rewards are paid in ~1.24 PART increments. A user holding only 50 PART, for example, would need to wait several months in between staking rewards.</p><p>With a staking pool, anyone can dedicate their staking powers to a staking pool which has the ability to send out staking reward payments in smaller increments, similarly to how proof-of-work mining pools allow multiple users to pool up their hashing powers to receive smaller but more numerous payments.</p><p>More details about this feature will be given at a later time.</p><h3 id=\"marketplace-and-project-governance-are-about-to-hit-testnet-\">Marketplace and Project Governance are About to Hit Testnet!</h3><p>Our governance mechanisms have seen a lot of progress being made to them in the last few weeks, and are now imminently reaching a point where they will start being integrated onto our testnet network for community testing. This will mark a very important milestone in the development of the Particl project, and can be tentatively expected for the new few weeks.</p><p>We hope to get as many testers as possible as the more people test these features, the more effectively we can identify bugs, improvements to be made, and such, which in turns can result in these features hitting mainnet more quickly. These are exciting times for the project and the pieces are starting to fall into place!</p><h3 id=\"a-new-video-showing-the-impressive-amount-of-work-put-into-particl-since-its-inception\">A New Video Showing the Impressive Amount of Work Put Into Particl Since its Inception</h3><p>Today we want to give you guys a sneak peek of a blog post that will likely come out next week. Using an open-source Github activity analysis tool, we were able to produce a mindblowing video highlighting the mindblowing amount of work that our development team has put into Particl since its inception.</p><p>In this video, the users moving around are blockchain developers. Those with their names written in green are Particl developers, and those with their names written in grey are Bitcoin developers. It highlights several of our development repositories (meaning repos like Particl.io, Branding, Whitepaper, and such are excluded), including Particl Core, Particl Desktop, Particl Market, OMP-Lib, and other repos instrumental to the development of the project.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iaaEG15n7zY?feature=oembed\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>It is particularly interesting to not only see how relentless our developers are regardless of the overall cryptocurrency market situation but also how keeping our codebase up-to-date with the latest Bitcoin Core version positively impacts the project. In fact, while Bitcoin Core developers do not work on Particl Core at all, their work on the Bitcoin codebase is still reflected on ours, granting us all the latest performance, stability, security, and usability developments made over Bitcoin Core. More videos, including isolated repositories such as Particl Desktop, will be posted in a coming dedicated blog post. Stay tuned!</p><h3 id=\"the-pivx-particl-alliance-voting-round-is-an-overwhelming-success-\">The PIVX-Particl Alliance Voting Round is an Overwhelming Success!</h3><p>We announced not too long ago that we had struck an agreement with the PIVX community to set up a vote for an alliance where they would get listed to the Particl Marketplace (as with every other coins, non-PART Particl Marketplace transactions still need to be ultimately settled in PART) and we would get listed on zDEX. Then, both marketing/social media teams would collaborate together for some cross-promotion, promoting privacy, security, and decentralization (more details here: <a href=\"https://forum.pivx.org/t/particl-application-for-pivx-alliance/4379\">https://forum.pivx.org/t/particl-application-for-pivx-alliance/4379</a>).</p><p>The voting round has been initiated on PIVX’s end, and it is safe to say that the proposal has been an overwhelming success! In fact, as it currently stands, the votes are 330 in favor of the alliance, and 4 are against it. We are very happy to see the PIVX community interested in joining forces with us and cooperate with a fellow privacy and decentralization-minded project! We take it as a huge stepping stone for cooperation between the two projects and maybe the start of something bigger, as in more cooperation campaigns between the two projects. As with everything-PIVX though, any further proposal will be required to be voted on by their community, but we are confident we may start seeing more joint proposals appearing in the future.</p><p>To track the proposal and its voting results, please follow this link: <a href=\"http://178.254.23.111/~pub/DN/DN_Info.html\">http://178.254.23.111/~pub/DN/DN_Info.html</a></p><h3 id=\"download-and-use-particl-desktop-1-2-2-before-it-is-released-\">Download and Use Particl Desktop 1.2.2 Before it is Released!</h3><p>Recently, most of the Particl Desktop development has been focused on the marketplace, but its wallet functions have also undergone quite a few major changes (and we fully expect the pace to pick up even more with our new Particl Desktop lead developer zaSmilingIdiot). In fact, you can download <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2\">Particl Desktop 1.2.2</a> today in its pre-release but stable version. This new Particl Desktop version is a major update on the <strong>mainnet</strong> wallet capabilities of Particl’s main client.

Speaking of BitcoinTalk, we do believe that it needs to be more active. In fact, every time a comment is posted in it, it bumps the thread to the top of the list, thus giving us more exposure, if only for a brief moment. We are looking into some ways to make it more active, including linking the thread to a Discord room or to a Particl forum megathread.

We, of course, welcome smaller or new exchanges to list us, and we have no problem providing development support to those, but we might not go ahead and pay the listing fees anymore.</p><p>As for Coinbase more specifically, we know they have started adding new coins and will work on seizing that opportunity!</p><h3 id=\"will-private-listings-be-able-to-be-governed-by-the-community\">Will private listings be able to be governed by the community?</h3><p>Both public and private listings will be governable by the community exclusively, however, as private listings do not appear on the public interface of the marketplace, they are expected to be much more unlikely to be voted out by the community unless it leaks to the public or creates a controversy.</p><p>That is because listings need to reach a certain user flagging threshold to be taken out of the marketplace, and since private listings are hidden to the entire public except for those in possession of its unique key or link, this threshold should be much harder to reach.</p><p>This will ensure users can still transact privately between each other and do so away from the public eye, but should the transacted content be highly inappropriate and leaked out, the community will still possess the ability to clean its marketplace from it.</p><p>As for one on one private deals where the private keys never leak to any other party other than the ones involved, they simply won’t be possible to moderate out as the flagging threshold for the deletion of listings will be set too high for any or both parties to singlehandedly have enough governing influence over it.</p><h3 id=\"when-i-do-a-search-on-google-for-decentralized-marketplaces-other-projects-show-up-on-the-first-page-but-not-particl-why-is-that-and-what-are-the-team-s-thoughts-about-this\">When I do a search on Google for decentralized marketplaces, other projects show up on the first page, but not Particl. Why is that and what are the team’s thoughts about this?</h3><p>We believe there are many reasons for it. For one, we are a very young project, at least compared to some of the decentralized marketplace projects out there, having only been “live” on mainnet since the 17th of July 2017. It also could be due to our relatively smaller community size. In fact, having a smaller community, and especially one that resides mostly on instant messaging platforms such as Discord or Telegram, generates fewer discussions about the project on the web, which in turn makes us harder for the search engine algorithms to pick up.</p><p>It’s also important not to forget that Particl is not merely a decentralized marketplace, but a full-blown privacy-focused decentralized application platform. This means that our community discussions are not only focused on the decentralized marketplace aspect of the project but also stretch into our many other perks and related topics such as cold staking, dApps, RingCT, privacy, security, and etc. This is in contrast with other “competitors” (quotes have been added as we strongly believe we are carving our very own niche category of blockchains) that focus exclusively on decentralized eCommerce. The fact we are building Particl to be much more than a marketplace, we believe, is one of our strongest quality and while it may result in less focused and more diversified discussions, it will ultimately allow us to reach out to a more a diverse set of users.</p><p>Following a similar train of thought, we are also very cautious about not heavily promoting aspects of the project that is still in deep stages of development as delays and unforeseen issues can always arise, especially when building a platform as complex as Particl is.</p><p>While this is most probably about to change as we near the completion of the first mainnet version of Particl Marketplace, the above reasons might have contributed in part to Particl being harder to find when referencing decentralized marketplace discussions. Getting better search results will require time, more updates, users, and web-based discussions. The latter, for example, is expected to dramatically improve as we are just about to release our forum. We, in fact, believe that it will help carry some of the great discussions going on over on the instant messaging platforms to an indexable and web-based platform. <strong>Please see the dedicated forum section of this update further down the page.</strong></p><h3 id=\"a-while-ago-there-was-a-twitter-poll-about-stable-coins-wouldn-t-integrating-any-of-these-hinder-user-s-privacy-and-usability-by-requiring-kyc-aml-identifications-wouldn-t-that-defeat-the-entire-purpose-of-the-particl-project\">A while ago, there was a Twitter poll about stable coins. Wouldn’t integrating any of these hinder user’s privacy and usability by requiring KYC/AML identifications? Wouldn’t that defeat the entire purpose of the Particl project?</h3><p>It is true that some stable coins (or any potential third-party integration) require KYC/AML identification of users <strong>on their end </strong>to be utilized to their full potential, however, it is not going to be something that is required for the Particl platform to provide any of its critical features.</p><p>For clarification purposes, this poll was meant as a fun way for us to get to know our community better. Stable coins, like the poll’s winner Digix, possess the interesting ability to maintain some kind of stable valuation (i.e. 1 DGX = 1g of physical gold, 1 USDt = ~1 USD, and etc). This can be super useful for people wishing to opt out of the fiat system, but also avoid the volatility usually associated with the cryptocurrency market.</p><p>Rest assured, any non-PART Particl Marketplace transaction still needs to, and will always need to, be settled in PART as it requires the coin’s RingCT capabilities to protect users’ privacy and also because the marketplace’s MAD escrow system is based on a Particl smart-contract that can only work using PART coins similarly to how Ether is the fuel for Ethereum-based smart-contracts and is required for them to execute.</p><p>Stable coins, in the case of Particl, are very interesting because they allow users to get the best of both the fiat and crypto world: an arguably stable means to store value that can be readily be spent on anything available on the Particl Marketplace. In that sense, both the marketplace and stable coins give each other a great use-case that comes very close to an eCommerce experience regular people are used to dealing with.</p><p>Note that it is possible for third-party integrations to require KYC/AML identifications, but that will <strong>always</strong> we offered as an option and will <strong>never </strong>be mandatory as that would directly go against our mission and what we stand for.</p><h3 id=\"is-the-team-aware-of-the-nothing-at-stake-attack-on-pos-consensus-algorithms-and-if-so-how-does-it-intend-to-fix-this-vulnerability\">Is the team aware of the Nothing-At-Stake attack on PoS consensus algorithms and if so, how does it intend to fix this vulnerability?</h3><p>Yes, the team is very aware of this often-promoted-by-PoW-advocates vulnerability of the Proof-of-Stake algorithm and has implemented checkpoints to mitigate this issue. We recommend joining the Open Development channel on Discord and chat with our developer Kewde to get more in-depth insights about how we have designed the Particl blockchain to be protected against this attack precisely.</p><h3 id=\"is-the-ringct-protocol-ready-for-mainnet-or-does-it-still-requires-some-tweaks-as-indicated-by-either-the-njit-department-of-technology-academic-report-or-wsa-s-security-audit\">Is the RingCT protocol ready for mainnet or does it still requires some tweaks as indicated by either the NJIT Department of Technology academic report or WSA’s security audit?</h3><p>Yes, both the academic report and security audit have indicated that no issue was found with our Bitcoin-based implementation of the RingCT protocol. As many of you already know, this implementation has been on testnet ever since we launched Particl on the 17th of July 2017 and thus is virtually ready for mainnet implementation.</p><p>Note that, as the RingCT hardfork will be combined (subject to change) with the marketplace governance one, it will have to wait until the latter is ready for mainnet implementation. It will be announced several weeks in advance for users to be aware of it coming.</p><h3 id=\"is-ringct-on-marketplace-transactions-a-requirement-for-particl-marketplace-mainnet\">Is RingCT on marketplace transactions a requirement for Particl Marketplace mainnet?</h3><p>Most likely. RingCT is tentatively planned on being hardforked at the same time as the marketplace governance system which is an absolute requirement for the marketplace to be released on mainnet. We have started to look into Bulletproofs, which is the RingCT/CT protocol improvement that should reduce privacy transaction sizes by about 80%, and might even add it to the hardfork.</p><p>The first step to enhancing our escrow system is to put CT on it, then shifting to RingCT should be pretty easy. Ultimately, the only absolute requirement for the marketplace is the governance system, and it would be unlikely that it would release without RingCT escrow as well, instead putting CT on the marketplace for a while, but this is not out of the question neither. We will keep you updated about this as we know more.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-moin-why-are-they-looking-into-forking-the-particl-codebase-and-what-impact-would-that-carry-for-the-particl-project\">What is MOIN? Why are they looking into forking the Particl codebase and what impact would that carry for the Particl project?</h3><p>MOIN is a small hobby project which is not associated in any way with the Particl team but their lead developer is on good terms with our Lead Graphic &#x26; Branding Designer CRZ. MOIN was started as a Shadowcash fork and just like we did in the past, probably realize how outdated this codebase is getting.</p><p>While we haven’t really received any information from them as of late, we did suggest to them that they increase their supply when hardforking and airdrop it to Particl holders as a token of appreciation and to cross-pollinate both communities.</p><h3 id=\"what-makes-particl-better-than-its-competition\">What makes Particl better than its competition?</h3><p>Particl has a lot of things going for it. One very important aspect is the fact that we have a coin which a community can rally behind. This is missing from OpenBazaar, which we believe they might start seeing the use of having one as they are planning on integrating some kind of token to their decentralized marketplace.</p><p>But the most important factors which makes us much different than <strong>any </strong>of our competitors is our focus on both security, privacy, and true decentralization without compromise. In fact, in the case of Syscoin’s Blockmarket marketplace, it is moderated by the Syscoin staff itself and in the case of OpenBazaar, they employ moderators. Both of these competitors also make use of a centralized form of escrow which not only makes the platforms less scalable (more people need to be hired or moderating as the more users start using these platforms), but it also leaves the door wide open for collusion between a staff member or escrow agent and one of the parties involved.</p><p>While it may seem unlikely that a third-party would collude with another party, it is actually more common than it seems. It is also possible for a third-party to make a wrong or bad decision when the participants of a marketplace transaction that’s been put in “conflict” cannot agree on any resolution or if one of them is lying to the escrow agent. There are countless examples where moderated deals can go bad, and we’d rather put 100% of the responsibility to the participating users themselves rather than a moderating party.</p><p>For a more detailed breakdown of Particl’s advantages over its competitors, you can refer back to a Reddit post made by Cryptoguard here: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/8k3kv2/what_are_the_competitive_advantages_of_particl/dz559jr\">https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/8k3kv2/what_are_the_competitive_advantages_of_particl/dz559jr</a></p><h3 id=\"are-there-any-plans-on-sending-more-particl-team-members-to-more-conferences-and-meetups\">Are there any plans on sending more Particl team members to more conferences and meetups?</h3><p>Absolutely! When we went to this year’s edition of the Consensus Conference, we noticed that we were one of the only projects with an actual product to show for, even though only on its Alpha version. This, in turn, attracted a lot of attention from the conference’s participants and we also were quite impressed by the number of people that actually knew about what we were building. This tells us that we need to have an increased presence in conferences as the sentiment we received from our short time in Consensus was quite positive.</p><p>Our budget is, however, quite limited for now as we are in a deep development phase and more focused on hiring developers to release our product than hyping “vaporware”. Sending team members and representatives to conferences, crypto-themed, and others will definitely be part of our budget once we go through our Primary Funding Round where we aim to raise much more capital than we did during the coin swap.</p><p>We would, nonetheless, support any community member desiring to present Particl in meetups or conferences. If you plan on attending or speaking to one such event, let us know and we will assist you with material and look into what you would need to make the presentation more impactful. Don’t hesitate to contact Paul Schmitzer, our Communications Manager, or Cryptoguard, our Community Manager, if you are interested.</p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &#x26; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"ledger-staking-tutorial-is-now-available-\">Ledger Staking Tutorial is Now Available!</h3><p>We announced on the 7th of August that Particl was finally able to be managed from Ledger Nano S hardware devices, with cold staking enabled. However, at the time of the announcement, no tutorial on how to enable hardware cold staking was available. This changed on the 17th of August when we officially published a proper tutorial on how to activate cold staking on these devices, <strong>making Particl the world’s safest Proof-of-Stake protocol</strong>. To enable your Ledger Nano S hardware device for cold staking, simply follow the steps included in this tutorial: <a href=\"https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking\">https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking</a></p><p><em><strong>Note: </strong></em><em>While this tutorial is pretty straight-forward, it may be reserved for the more advanced users. If you do not want to mess with the debug window or some of the more advanced features of the Particl blockchain, it is recommended that you wait for the Particl Desktop integration which will come at a later time.</em></p><h3 id=\"new-particl-desktop-developer-s-first-commit\">New Particl Desktop Developer’s First Commit</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--5/1-pPTQ44Cy-aSYxa4DOKe8yw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>As mentioned a few times already, we hired a new developer in July to lead and oversee the development of our Particl Desktop client (as well as potentially working on Particl Copay), the centerpiece of the Particl platform, starting on August 1st, 2018. He has now started reviewing our entire Particl Desktop code and <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1113\">has even pushed his first commit</a>, a rather large one, on Github which shows great professionalism. In fact, <a href=\"https://github.com/zaSmilingIdiot\">zaSmilingIdiot</a> has a lot of experience working with large teams of developers and his work methodology will surely be a great asset to our project and its development pace. Consult his first PR by following this link: <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1113\">https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1113</a></p><p>It is worth noting that, whenever you log into Github and consult pull requests, Github will indicate you, upon consulting at a later time, of the new changes and updates made to the pull request since the last time you looked at it. This can be quite useful when tracking the development progress of the project.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--5/1-tL7afRrDjl94gy4OKkl6nQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Pull Request Updates Indicator</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"new-status-report-published-includes-new-exciting-developments\">New Status Report Published Includes New Exciting Developments</h3><p>Speaking of development, we’ve published on the 20th of August a new Status Report showing the project’s progress. While it contains similar items as our last Status Report, several of them have been moved to the “Waiting for Review” category, meaning they’ve been completed and are undergoing the final testing phase. These items include Particl Desktop 1.2.2 (<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2\">which is already available to anyone as a stable mainnet pre-release</a>) <strong>and the long-awaited marketplace governance system (version 1.0)</strong>. If all the testing goes well, we should see the governance mechanism appear in some form or the other on Particl Marketplace Alpha (<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2\">can be downloaded here</a>) in the coming weeks.</p><h3 id=\"staking-pools-incoming-\">Staking Pools Incoming!</h3><p>One of the biggest takeaway one can get from our latest Status Report is the inclusion of staking pool related features in the “In Development” category. This is directly in relation to our commitment to offer secure but accessible options to ALL of our users and will also potentially strengthen the Particl network by incentivizing even more users to run their own node. In fact, Tecnovert, our Core Lead Developer, has started working on a cold staking pool proof-of-concept that would allow any user to stake their funds and receive constant rewards regardless of the amount they hold. As it currently stands, anyone, big or small holder, can put up their funds for staking, but those with smaller balances may find the process impractical as staking rewards are paid in ~1.24 PART increments. A user holding only 50 PART, for example, would need to wait several months in between staking rewards.</p><p>With a staking pool, anyone can dedicate their staking powers to a staking pool which has the ability to send out staking reward payments in smaller increments, similarly to how proof-of-work mining pools allow multiple users to pool up their hashing powers to receive smaller but more numerous payments.</p><p>More details about this feature will be given at a later time.</p><h3 id=\"marketplace-and-project-governance-are-about-to-hit-testnet-\">Marketplace and Project Governance are About to Hit Testnet!</h3><p>Our governance mechanisms have seen a lot of progress being made to them in the last few weeks, and are now imminently reaching a point where they will start being integrated onto our testnet network for community testing. This will mark a very important milestone in the development of the Particl project, and can be tentatively expected for the new few weeks.</p><p>We hope to get as many testers as possible as the more people test these features, the more effectively we can identify bugs, improvements to be made, and such, which in turns can result in these features hitting mainnet more quickly. These are exciting times for the project and the pieces are starting to fall into place!</p><h3 id=\"a-new-video-showing-the-impressive-amount-of-work-put-into-particl-since-its-inception\">A New Video Showing the Impressive Amount of Work Put Into Particl Since its Inception</h3><p>Today we want to give you guys a sneak peek of a blog post that will likely come out next week. Using an open-source Github activity analysis tool, we were able to produce a mindblowing video highlighting the mindblowing amount of work that our development team has put into Particl since its inception.</p><p>In this video, the users moving around are blockchain developers. Those with their names written in green are Particl developers, and those with their names written in grey are Bitcoin developers. It highlights several of our development repositories (meaning repos like Particl.io, Branding, Whitepaper, and such are excluded), including Particl Core, Particl Desktop, Particl Market, OMP-Lib, and other repos instrumental to the development of the project.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iaaEG15n7zY?feature=oembed\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>It is particularly interesting to not only see how relentless our developers are regardless of the overall cryptocurrency market situation but also how keeping our codebase up-to-date with the latest Bitcoin Core version positively impacts the project. In fact, while Bitcoin Core developers do not work on Particl Core at all, their work on the Bitcoin codebase is still reflected on ours, granting us all the latest performance, stability, security, and usability developments made over Bitcoin Core. More videos, including isolated repositories such as Particl Desktop, will be posted in a coming dedicated blog post. Stay tuned!</p><h3 id=\"the-pivx-particl-alliance-voting-round-is-an-overwhelming-success-\">The PIVX-Particl Alliance Voting Round is an Overwhelming Success!</h3><p>We announced not too long ago that we had struck an agreement with the PIVX community to set up a vote for an alliance where they would get listed to the Particl Marketplace (as with every other coins, non-PART Particl Marketplace transactions still need to be ultimately settled in PART) and we would get listed on zDEX. Then, both marketing/social media teams would collaborate together for some cross-promotion, promoting privacy, security, and decentralization (more details here: <a href=\"https://forum.pivx.org/t/particl-application-for-pivx-alliance/4379\">https://forum.pivx.org/t/particl-application-for-pivx-alliance/4379</a>).</p><p>The voting round has been initiated on PIVX’s end, and it is safe to say that the proposal has been an overwhelming success! In fact, as it currently stands, the votes are 330 in favor of the alliance, and 4 are against it. We are very happy to see the PIVX community interested in joining forces with us and cooperate with a fellow privacy and decentralization-minded project! We take it as a huge stepping stone for cooperation between the two projects and maybe the start of something bigger, as in more cooperation campaigns between the two projects. As with everything-PIVX though, any further proposal will be required to be voted on by their community, but we are confident we may start seeing more joint proposals appearing in the future.</p><p>To track the proposal and its voting results, please follow this link: <a href=\"http://178.254.23.111/~pub/DN/DN_Info.html\">http://178.254.23.111/~pub/DN/DN_Info.html</a></p><h3 id=\"download-and-use-particl-desktop-1-2-2-before-it-is-released-\">Download and Use Particl Desktop 1.2.2 Before it is Released!</h3><p>Recently, most of the Particl Desktop development has been focused on the marketplace, but its wallet functions have also undergone quite a few major changes (and we fully expect the pace to pick up even more with our new Particl Desktop lead developer zaSmilingIdiot). In fact, you can download <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2\">Particl Desktop 1.2.2</a> today in its pre-release but stable version. This new Particl Desktop version is a major update on the <strong>mainnet</strong> wallet capabilities of Particl’s main client.

Speaking of BitcoinTalk, we do believe that it needs to be more active. In fact, every time a comment is posted in it, it bumps the thread to the top of the list, thus giving us more exposure, if only for a brief moment. We are looking into some ways to make it more active, including linking the thread to a Discord room or to a Particl forum megathread.

Within this short\nperiod of time, a lot has been accomplished by our development team, as\ndocumented in these two recapitulation articles (1\n[https://particl.news/particl-2017-year-in-review-b9984b8ce797], 2\n[https://particl.news/particl-genesis-anniversary-b2d4ceff1f95]) as well as our\nnow bi-weekly Community Updates (1\n[https://particl.news/particl-community-update-1-d80c1d3201f5], 2\n[https://particl.news/community-update-2-9525cd94bade], 3\n[https://particl.news/community-update-3-407404771f11], 4\n[https://particl.news/community-update-4-1df4f5aafe5f], 5\n[https://particl.news/project-update-5-bf6f510a538c]). In fact, the Particl\nproject has grown into an impressive network full of technological innovations.\nWhile some of the innovations are currently available on mainnet (Particl\nDesktop, cold staking, Ledger staking, Confidential Transactions, atomic swaps,\nand etc), most of the really impressive stuff (decentralized marketplace,\ntrustless MAD escrow system, decentralized project governance, decentralized\nmarketplace governance, staking pool, etc) either currently only resides on\nParticl’s public testnet or in developers’ personal repositories and still under\nheavy development.\n\nSome crypto rating agencies have taken notice of the prowesses our development\nteam has pulled off. For example, Particl consistently ranked in the top 7 (\ncurrently ranked 6th\n[https://medium.com/dprating/dprating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-june-2018-who-is-still-coding-in-the-bear-283c89735cbe]\n) of Darpal [https://medium.com/@DPRating]’s monthly reports in 2018, a Github\ncode rating agency, for the entire year of 2018. Particl is consistently ranked\nfirst among privacy coins as well as decentralized marketplaces! CryptoMiso\n[https://cryptomiso.com/], another Github monitoring rating group, currently\nranks Particl in 15th place out of a total of 867 ranked projects within the\nlast 12 months.\n\nWhat if there was a way to visualize Particl’s development history in a more\nuser-friendly way than to manually scan Github stats?\nWith the help of the open-source Github visualizer software Gource\n[http://gource.io/], we produced a series of videos demonstrating the constant\nand impressive work our development team has put into Particl since its\ninception (and the weeks leading up to it).\n\nIn the following videos, you will see visualizations of Particl’s Github\nactivity throughout time. Each moving user you see is a developer that has had\nactivity recorded on one of the displayed repositories. Remember, as we\nconstantly keep our codebase up-to-date with Bitcoin’s, this time-lapse video is\na testament to the cooperation of our 2 teams display. Rather than being in\ncompetition with Bitcoin, Particl is a privacy-focused compliment to Bitcoin,\nand you can see that immediately with both teams represented and developing\nin-step with one another.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGeneral Overview of the Particl Network\nLinks: Particl-Core [http://particl-core], Particl-Desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop] (market\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/tree/market] branch), Particl-Market\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-market], Partyman (cold staking)\n[https://github.com/dasource/partyman], Copay [https://github.com/particl/copay]\n, OMP-Lib [https://github.com/particl/omp-lib], Atomicswap\n[https://github.com/particl/atomicswap], Particl-Bitcore-Lib\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-bitcore-lib], Bitcore-Mnemonic, \nParticl-Bitcoind-RPC [https://github.com/particl/particl-bitcoind-rpc], \nParticl-Bitcore-Message [https://github.com/particl/particl-bitcore-message], \nParticl-Bitcore-Node [https://github.com/particl/particl-bitcore-node], \nBlue-App-BTC [https://github.com/particl/blue-app-btc], Particl-Insight-API\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-insight-api], Particl-Insight-UI\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-insight-ui], Partsuite_Partd\n[https://github.com/particl/partsuite_partd], Partsuite_Partutil\n[https://github.com/particl/partsuite_partutil]\n\nWhat Am I Seeing in This Video?\nTecnovert, Particl’s Lead Core Developer & Cryptographer, making some commits\nThis Particl network overview video regroups all of the major development-based\nrepositories, meaning that non-development repositories such as the particl.io\n[https://github.com/particl/particl.io], branding\n[https://github.com/particl/branding], whitepaper\n[https://github.com/particl/whitepaper], as well as a few others are excluded.\nIt shows Particl developers’ Github activity over time. Each moving user is a\nGithub user that has contributed to one of the listed repositories, and each\n“ray” being shot from these users is a contribution. Furthermore, we have\nhighlighted Particl developers so that their names and pictograms appear in\ngreen whereas Bitcoin Core developers appear as a white/grey name color.\n\nEach “node” represents a folder within one of our repositories and their link to\nother folders are identified by “branches”. Every folder within the same\nrepository is represented under the same “master branch”.\n\nNote: None of these visualizations displays all the work done by the development\nteam. Indeed, each repository is represented by a single Git branch, meaning\nthat work accomplished on other git branches is not reflected in the animation.\nFor example, Particl Desktop’s visualization is set up on the “market” branch,\nwhich is the most up-to-date but doesn’t display the work being done on the \nfeature-multiwallet-v2\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/tree/feature/multiwallet-v2] and \nproposals [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/tree/proposals] branches\n(see active branches here [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/branches]\n).\n\nObservations\nWhat is particularly interesting to notice is just how much the Bitcoin Core\ndevelopers are contributing, indirectly, to the Particl project. In fact,\nbecause we constantly update our codebase to match the latest version of Bitcoin\nCore, we benefit from all the ongoing research and development going on over the\nBitcoin network.\n\nMoreover, keeping our codebase up-to-date not only grants the Particl blockchain\nwith all the security, performance, stability, privacy, and utility enhancements\nmade to the Bitcoin blockchain, but it also enables our development team to fork\nany interesting Bitcoin product and adapt it to work over the Particl network.\n\nParticl Copay, our mobile wallet currently available on Google Play\n[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.particl.copay&hl=en] and for \ndesktops [https://github.com/particl/copay/releases], is a great example and\ndemonstration of this concept. In fact, Copay [https://github.com/bitpay/copay] \nhas initially been developed by Bitpay [https://github.com/bitpay] and was\ndesigned to be a Bitcoin-only mobile wallet. It was, however, forked by the\nParticl development team to give its community an easy-to-use mobile wallet that\ncould also double as a tool to generate and use Particl multi-signature\naddresses, a feature that, to this day, is still only available on Particl\nCopay.\n\nParticl Desktop & Particl Market From Up Close\nWe’ve also isolated three of the repositories shown in the Particl Network\nvisualization and zoomed in to show in greater details the work being\naccomplished. These three repositories are the three main ones in the project\nand are the ones which are being developed the most to accomplish our vision.\n\nParticl Desktop\nParticl Market\nParticl Core in Comparison to Bitcoin Core\nIn the video above, you can compare both Bitcoin’s (left) and Particl’s (right)\ncore codebases. This visualization really highlights the relentless work\naccomplished by our Lead Core Developer & Cryptographer Tecnovert as he adds\nfeatures on top of the Bitcoin codebase at a record speed while constantly\nkeeping Particl’s codebase version in sync with that of Bitcoin’s.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Development-Timeline-Video/1-QqvirCy91HiCO2ToI4Il9Q.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>The Particl project has now been around for around 14 months.

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est. July, 2025\n * Implementation: Upon successful vote (75% approval rate with minimum quorum\n   of 20% of the total supply over 10,080 blocks) and subsequent hard fork.\n\nImpact\nIf approved, this change will:\n\n * Significantly reduce PART's inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%;\n * Reduce PART’s inflation rate by 0.5% every year until it reaches 1.0%;\n * Remove the network treasury;\n * Initiate a hard fork of the Particl blockchain.\n\nWe believe this proposal represents a positive step toward optimizing the\nParticl network's economic model while ensuring sustainable project development\nand incentivising our community to actively promote and grow the\nnetwork.Important: For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are\nrunning its latest version.

Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively targeting transformation into hard money.</strong></p><p>At present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget generated by:</p><ul><li>Network transaction fees</li><li>New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).</li></ul><p>Staking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active circulation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new tokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens minted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases - rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by<br>new token issuance (supply inflation).</p><p>In many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism of asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes that we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token for yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked will either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network grows.</p><p>Staking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not actively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity. Staking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value of circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however paradoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are essentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity that brings intrinsic value<br>to the network.</p><p>So if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed towards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully transform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?</p><p>Simple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the frequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively reducing new token issuance.</p><p>Fortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key applications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:</p><h3 id=\"basicswapdex-bsx-\">BasicSwapDex (BSX)</h3><ul><li>Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​</li><li>​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third party<br>integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap) with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</h3><ul><li>Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds utilised in purchasing goods and services.​</li><li>​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.</li></ul><p><strong>In any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development team and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl network otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time.</strong> They are effectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual supply inflation reward decreases.</p><p>I note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation rate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that result in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft currency.</p><p><strong>It is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus on increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability</strong> to create an L1 system whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to adequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful in that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with additional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money<br>than traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other cryptocurrencies currently traded today.</p><p>Regardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community is active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to further propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to 0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency funded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that satisfies my definition of “hard money”.</p><h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2><ul><li>Voting opens: Est.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>.
