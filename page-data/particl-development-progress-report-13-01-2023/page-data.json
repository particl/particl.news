This will essentially enable offers to remain available\nindefinitely, or until the trader removes them from the books.\n\nMoreover, the script can access external APIs to acquire the market prices of\nvarious cryptocurrencies, and relist offers at a specified percentage above or\nbelow the current market price.\n\nAt this time, the script is not ready for production or public testing, however,\nthe delivery of the script is an important first step in providing helpful\nmarket making tools to BasicSwap, a necessary prerequisite for the DEX in order\nto achieve a sufficient level of liquidity.\n\nAs we are continuing to evaluate the script's core features, as well as add\nsupplementary functionality and test it, we will keep you informed of its\nprogress in the next weekly updates.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nWe have seen steady progress in regards to updating the user interface with\nseveral of its intended improvements. \n\nThe task list remains unchanged from last week, with the addition of volume\nmeters to the new price charting system. You can refer to the list below as a\nreminder of what we're working on:\n\n * Integrating the new subfee feature to make coin withdrawals and offer posting\n   easier (no need to manually calculate fees) into the GUI.\n * Addition of a dark mode.\n * Addition of a \"simple\" mode for the GUI in which the user interface is\n   slimmed down. This aims at simplifying the user experience but still allowing\n   for more advanced options via a \"simple/advanced\" toggler.\n * Addition of a new price charting system. The current chart style will still\n   be available and it'll be possible to select which one you want to use via\n   the settings page.\n * Introduction of a wide variety of GUI improvements, tweaks, and changes based\n   on feedback from our beta testers.\n\nWe anticipate deploying the changes shortly, allowing all users to update their\nlocal BasicSwap instances and take advantage of the new features.\n\nPART Now Available on Stack Wallet ?\nParticl Added to Stack Wallet (Mobile Wallet)The Particl coin is now officially\nsupported by the open-source and non-custodial mobile wallet\nStackWallet.Particl\nNewscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-added-to-stackwallet-mobile-wallet/]Earlier this\nweek, we announced that Particl is now officially available on the open-source\nand non-custodian mobile wallet Stack Wallet [https://stackwallet.com].\n\nThis integration allows you to securely store and manage your public PART coins\non-the-go with a user-friendly and intuitive interface, without compromising on\ndecentralization.\n\nFor further information regarding the integration process and to obtain the\nmobile application, please follow this link\n[https://particl.news/particl-added-to-stackwallet-mobile-wallet/].\n\nParticl Ecosystem — 2022 in Review ?️\nLast week, we unveiled a Particl Core development progress visualizer\n[https://youtu.be/akPCMt7PFFI], and now we are delighted to announce the\navailability of a new visualizer that captures the development progress of the\nmain components of the entire Particl ecosystem, such as Particl Core, Particl\nDesktop, and BasicSwap DEX.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

also due to institutional investments chasing this\nrising cryptocurrency trend. If it wasn’t already the case, the crypto world\ntruly became a bona fide industry, complete with billion-dollar institutions,\nand fiduciary responsibility over trillions of dollars from its biggest\ncentralized players. Following this new landscape, as the night to day, came the\ninterest of regulators and government bodies. Unfortunately, much of it is still\nto come.\n\nFor this reason and others, a lot of people enamored by cryptocurrency’s initial\npromises — an uncompromising, radically privacy-focused marriage between the\ninternet and mediums of exchange — have found themselves compelled to retreat\nfrom nearly all currently existing centralized crypto asset platforms. \n\nWhat we now call “privacy coins” began to show themselves as one of the only\nlegal shelters to existing and looming regulations (the ‘privacy’ distinction\nhere is even ironic, as it is clear as day that “a peer-to-peer electronic cash\nsystem” would need to confine itself to the decisions of two peers and two peers\nonly, with no inherent access or need for third parties to meddle with the\ndecisions of those two peers). This, of course, is only half the battle: where \nand how those privacy coins are to be traded is also at issue.\n\n\nRegulation and Privacy-Preserving Assets\nMonero, Dash, Particl, Firo and other privacy coins are spearheading many\ntechnologies in the ever-evolving domain of cryptic currency. With them,\nanonymous transactions, at least to people that understand the initial vision,\nestablished themselves as a necessary component of Satoshi’s famous whitepaper.\nAnd by extension, privacy-focused decentralized exchanges also revealed\nthemselves as necessary for said transactional privacy to take on any meaningful\nform.\n\nTrading exchanges, where most of the liquidity lies, are increasingly being\naffected by government regulations, transforming them to become highly regulated\nmen-in-the-middle of most trades. This is obviously anathema to the original\ncypherpunk vision of privacy coins and cryptocurrency in general — still, to\nthis day, most privacy coins are traded on centralized exchanges. \n\nThis is a fatal compromise on the very concept of private currencies, and a\ncritical obstacle for privacy technologies; but it is a reality that projects\nmust nonetheless navigate through, in compliance. \n\nThe question of liquidity is also to consider within this kind of hyper-private,\ndecentralized ethos. Well-populated, centralized exchanges and order books are\nthe norm, and for a long time were considered necessary for mass adoption. This,\nof course, lent itself to disasters, such as the FTX debacle\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/12/13/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-collapse-explained]\n, the BTC-e shutdown\n[https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/russian-national-and-bitcoin-exchange-charged-21-count-indictment-operating-alleged]\n, the BitFinex hack\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bitfinex-hacked-hongkong-idUSKCN10E0KP], and\nothers. Most cryptocurrency users came to understand this the hard way: although\ndecentralized exchange adoption is still lacking, it seems “holding your own\nkeys” is now more ingrained into the crypto psyche than it ever was.\n\nHyper-privacy and the AMM Model\nAnother noteworthy, but often overlooked, compromise on total privacy and\nresilience is the current (some say, inherent) state of automated market makers,\nor AMMs. AMMs are essential to the vast majority of currently existing DEX\nexchanges and bring us one step closer to leaving custodial solutions behind for\ngood. However, they are not without flaws: impermanent losses and associated\nfees are commonly cited, but AMM-based models actually have to contend with many\npotential vulnerabilities, with regard to both security and privacy.\n\nFrom a security perspective, smart contracts and the complex collaborations\nbetween them can, of course, lead to potential protocol vulnerabilities. BSX, by\ndesign, opts for “lower-level” alternatives to smart contracts deemed safer,\nsuch as scriptless scripts and adaptor signatures\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-dex/basicswap_technicals.html].\nOn the other hand, AMM liquidity pools often make heavy use of smart contracts,\nwhich have in the past made them targets of malicious attacks such as \nreentrancy\nattacks [https://hackernoon.com/hack-solidity-reentrancy-attack], among many\nothers. Reentrancy attacks occur when a trusted smart contract makes an external\ncall to a separate, untrusted smart contract, in order to exploit a potential\nbug in the code which would allow it to drain or manipulate smart contract\nassets. This can have devastating effects on targeted liquidity pools, and by\nextension to AMM liquidity providers - the Siren protocol, which was victim of\nsuch a hack in 2021\n[https://halborn.com/explained-the-siren-protocol-hack-september-2021/] to the\ntune of $3.5 million dollars, is merely one example out of many.\n\nOther security contingencies that AMM liquidity providers have to contend with\ninclude oracle attacks\n[https://medium.com/harvest-finance/harvest-flashloan-economic-attack-post-mortem-3cf900d65217]\n, block timestamp manipulation\n[https://cryptomarketpool.com/block-timestamp-manipulation-attack], and the\ninfamous rug pulls that have become far too common. The semi-centralized aspects\nof AMMs, especially AMMs powered by in-house tokens such as Sushiswap or\nPancakeSwap, also amount to a security flaw in some respects, as the only way to\nensure that liquidity providers on AMMs are consistently profitable is often by\ncounteracting losses with heavy, hyper-inflationary financial incentives in the\nform of newly created native tokens.\n\nPotential privacy vulnerabilities within AMM models are also to be considered.\nIt is absolutely necessary for the BSX protocol to be entirely impervious to\nblockchain analysis and identity tracing to safeguard the personal safety of its\nusers — especially when swapping directly with unknown parties — which is a\npotential liability that most AMM-based DEXs, even ones that rely on standard\natomic swaps, have to contend with. \n\nTo that end, BSX employs adaptor signatures\n[https://github.com/ElementsProject/scriptless-scripts/blob/master/md/atomic-swap.md] \nto allow for completely hidden atomic swaps, without any sort of matching hashes\non participating blockchains, thus preventing any sort of analysis or\nlinkability of transactions over time. In combination with that, BasicSwap’s\ntype of order book, where one can pick and choose offers instead of having to\nfollow bid and ask curves, provides a user experience that is similar to that of\ncentralized exchanges but ensures total obfuscation of what is being traded and\nwhen. This ensures that the protocol is highly resilient against analysis,\nincluding identity tracing and behavioral model inference.\n\nIt is also worth noting that “DEX” exchanges that are confined to one chain, or\nits clones (via “bridges”), also come with their own fatal compromises on\nabsolute privacy and security, as exemplified by critical vulnerabilities\n[https://blockworks.co/news/secret-network-crypto-transactions-not-so-secret-after-all] \ndiscovered in November of last year.\n\nCommunity Liquidity with BasicSwap\nThe above considerations and the harsh reality of difficult and complex\nregulations which projects must navigate through, in compliance, weigh heavily\nin the protocol design of BasicSwap, especially with regard to encouraging\nliquidity within the network without sacrificing security or privacy. \n\nBasicSwap, a free and completely cross-chain decentralized trading protocol\nusing a novel implementation of atomic swap-based trading and the SMSG network\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/], is\nmeant as a zero-compromise alternative for private peer-to-peer trades - that\nmeans a lot of liquidity solutions available for other decentralized exchanges,\neven ones with an eye for privacy, are rejected by BasicSwap as privacy\ncompromises on one level or another.

Most cryptocurrency users came to understand this the hard way: although decentralized exchange adoption is still lacking, it seems “holding your own keys” is now more ingrained into the crypto psyche than it ever was.</p><h2 id=\"hyper-privacy-and-the-amm-model\">Hyper-privacy and the AMM Model</h2><p>Another noteworthy, but often overlooked, compromise on total privacy and resilience is the current (some say, inherent) state of automated market makers, or AMMs. AMMs are essential to the vast majority of currently existing DEX exchanges and bring us one step closer to leaving custodial solutions behind for good. However, they are not without flaws: impermanent losses and associated fees are commonly cited, but AMM-based models actually have to contend with many potential vulnerabilities, with regard to both security and privacy.</p><p>From a security perspective, smart contracts and the complex collaborations between them can, of course, lead to potential protocol vulnerabilities. BSX, by design, opts for “lower-level” alternatives to smart contracts deemed safer, such as<a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-dex/basicswap_technicals.html\"> scriptless scripts and adaptor signatures</a>. On the other hand, AMM liquidity pools often make heavy use of smart contracts, which have in the past made them targets of malicious attacks such as<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/hack-solidity-reentrancy-attack\"> reentrancy attacks</a>, among many others. Reentrancy attacks occur when a trusted smart contract makes an external call to a separate, untrusted smart contract, in order to exploit a potential bug in the code which would allow it to drain or manipulate smart contract assets. This can have devastating effects on targeted liquidity pools, and by extension to AMM liquidity providers - the Siren protocol, which was<a href=\"https://halborn.com/explained-the-siren-protocol-hack-september-2021/\"> victim of such a hack in 2021</a> to the tune of $3.5 million dollars, is merely one example out of many.</p><p>Other security contingencies that AMM liquidity providers have to contend with include<a href=\"https://medium.com/harvest-finance/harvest-flashloan-economic-attack-post-mortem-3cf900d65217\"> oracle attacks</a>,<a href=\"https://cryptomarketpool.com/block-timestamp-manipulation-attack\"> block timestamp manipulation</a>, and the infamous rug pulls that have become far too common. The semi-centralized aspects of AMMs, especially AMMs powered by in-house tokens such as Sushiswap or PancakeSwap, also amount to a security flaw in some respects, as the only way to ensure that liquidity providers on AMMs are consistently profitable is often by counteracting losses with heavy, hyper-inflationary financial incentives in the form of newly created native tokens.</p><p>Potential privacy vulnerabilities within AMM models are also to be considered. It is absolutely necessary for the BSX protocol to be entirely impervious to blockchain analysis and identity tracing to safeguard the personal safety of its users — especially when swapping directly with unknown parties — which is a potential liability that most AMM-based DEXs, even ones that rely on standard atomic swaps, have to contend with. </p><p>To that end, BSX employs <a href=\"https://github.com/ElementsProject/scriptless-scripts/blob/master/md/atomic-swap.md\">adaptor signatures</a> to allow for completely hidden atomic swaps, <strong>without any sort of matching hashes on participating blockchains</strong>, thus preventing any sort of analysis or linkability of transactions over time. In combination with that, BasicSwap’s type of order book, where one can pick and choose offers instead of having to follow bid and ask curves, provides a user experience that is similar to that of centralized exchanges but ensures total obfuscation of what is being traded and when. This ensures that the protocol is highly resilient against analysis, including identity tracing and behavioral model inference.</p><p>It is also worth noting that “DEX” exchanges that are confined to one chain, or its clones (via “bridges”), also come with their own fatal compromises on absolute privacy and security, as exemplified by<a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/secret-network-crypto-transactions-not-so-secret-after-all\"> critical vulnerabilities</a> discovered in November of last year.</p><h2 id=\"community-liquidity-with-basicswap\">Community Liquidity with BasicSwap</h2><p>The above considerations and the harsh reality of difficult and complex regulations which projects must navigate through, in compliance, weigh heavily in the protocol design of BasicSwap, especially with regard to encouraging liquidity within the network without sacrificing security or privacy. </p><p>BasicSwap, a free and completely <strong>cross-chain</strong> decentralized trading protocol using a novel implementation of atomic swap-based trading and the<a href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\"> SMSG network</a>, is meant as a zero-compromise alternative for private peer-to-peer trades - that means a lot of liquidity solutions available for other decentralized exchanges, even ones with an eye for privacy, are rejected<strong> </strong>by BasicSwap as privacy compromises on one level or another.

SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
