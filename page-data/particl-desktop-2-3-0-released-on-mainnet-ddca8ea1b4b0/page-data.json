This new client update introduces the brand\nnew in-wallet exchange module on Particl’s live network. This exchange acts as a\ngreat complement to the Open Marketplace, allowing you to quickly and easily\nswap your BTC for PART.\n\nParticl Desktop 2.3.0 on MainnetIn-wallet Bitcoin Exchange\nSwap BTC for PART Straight from Particl Desktop!The in-wallet exchange tab,\npowered by the new SMSG bot, allows you to quickly fund your Particl Desktop\nwallet with PART by swapping BTC. The exchange module is also integrated right\ninto the buy flow in a way that will easily let you swap BTC for PART when you\ndon’t have enough funds to checkout your cart. Then, once the PART coins are\nconfirmed into your wallet and have matured (requires 12 confirmations), you can\njust get back to your cart and place your order with the seller.\n\nSMSG Bot & Bot Management\nManage SMSG Bots (More Bots Coming in the Future)The in-wallet Bitcoin exchange\nmodule is currently powered by SimpleSwap through the brand new SMSG bot. The\nSMSG bot also allows for other exchanges and service providers to be integrated\nright into Particl Desktop and will become, over time, a key component of the\nupcoming SDK. While the bot can be set up with different exchanges and also\nother coins, it is only enabled for Bitcoin on SimpleSwap…for now!\n\n> Note: The exchange bot may not show up initially when going to the Bot\nManagement page. That’s because it is based on the SMSG peer-to-peer network and\nit needs to sync, in full, to be available. In a way, the bot will appear just\nlike a listing — once the network as scanned the relevant SMSG message\ncontaining all the information required to display the bot on your Particl\nDesktop client. If you click on Bot Management and the page keeps loading, just\nwait it out!\nCancel Bids\nParticl Desktop 2.2.0 introduced the ability to cancel bids.

Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
