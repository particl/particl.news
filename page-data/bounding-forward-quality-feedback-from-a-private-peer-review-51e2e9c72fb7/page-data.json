There are many challenging yet\nachievable goals proposed by this company that validate the contributions\neveryone has made to Particl so far. They also give positive reinforcement to\nour short and long-term direction of building better tech and attracting more\ndaily users; aka adoption.\n\nThe “who” isn’t as important as is the fact that this is more an intriguing\nsampling of many peer reviews our products are receiving from potential\npartners, investors, services looking to join us on this ride. However — of\ncourse — it does matter “who” is really, truly looking at what is going on in\nthe De-Commerce (has a nice ring to it ?) space so I can divulge that it’s a\nlarge crypto company that touches nearly all the top projects and products in\nour space. This is a group we first reached out to about integrations for\nbroader adoption and the relationship has been nurtured for over a\nyear-and-a-half.\n\nSo what do they have to say? My first thought when I read their feedback and\nrecommendations was, “We need to share this with the community!” I’ve said it\nmany times, in the early stages our voice needs to get louder and louder for\nreal adoption to happen. That means all of us.\n\nIt got me excited about 2020 and beyond — I hope it does you as well.\n> “We can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we\ncreated them.” – Albert Einstein, Thinker\nI’ll start at the bottom and work up. First, we have things they identified as\nunsatisfactory or in need of improvements.\n\nAs a trained architect, critique like this is like gold. It’s enlightening to\nread through honest observations, and when we’re enlightened we change.\n\nReducing barriers for adoption\nPrivacy-focused products are niche, underground and nerdy. That’s cool, but\ncan’t be “good enough” and can’t be a crutch to expanding outside of the crypto\necosystem. To this end, Particl is falling into the same trap as Tor, Tails and\neven DuckDuckGo — building better alternatives that add more steps to ensure\nprivacy.\n\n * What are ways we are reducing barriers to see significant marketplace\n   adoption of the Particl Open Marketplace?\n * Is our product available where the target users will find it?\n * Mobile app vs downloadable client\n\nLow transactions using privacy features\nParticl base transactions are private by user choice. Open Marketplace\ntransactions are private by default. Privacy for senders and receivers only\nimproves as the anonymity set increases on chain. Marketplace transactions\nutilize the full suite of privacy features on Particl.\n\n * What are measurable methods to increasing the amount of transactions using\n   privacy features?\n * Are there incentives that can be built in to increase transactions using\n   privacy features?\n * Can services and exchanges be receptive to enabling private transactions with\n   PART?\n\nQuality and depth of product inventory\nCurrently we have around 500 items listed daily on the Open Marketplace. There\nis a lot of variety from games to electronics to health products. However, I\nthink this is one of the most insightful points within the review. Quantity vs\nquality can be the difference between 1,000 daily users and 10,000 daily users.\n\n * What tools to vendors need to move their inventories onto Particl Open\n   Marketplace?\n * Customers use their phone to shop while Particl only offers a downloadable\n   client, when and how does a mobile version of Open Marketplace improve the\n   quality of products available?\n * Who is the target audience?\n\nNext are three areas we actually are focused on at the moment and internally see\nas crucial to improve on. There is no question the Open Marketplace is an\nattractive product — especially compared to traditionally clunky privacy-focused\napplications and cryptocurrency clients. What can we improve upon to\nmetaphorically put some meat on the strong bones in place to take things to the\nnext level?\n\nMore awareness of the growth on the marketplace\nOur Open Marketplace has been live on the main chain for close to 6 months and\nthe small amount of measurable metrics track-able show that it has been\nrelatively successful and is growing. Being private-by-default doesn’t give\ncompanies reviewing our products much to work with to show either profitability\nor growth. It is really just 2 things, volume and transactions. A third metric\nwe can track is MAD contracts. Not the content but just the amount of them that\nget completed. Keeping things private, but finding better ways to bring\nawareness to the popularity of the Open Marketplace will take an army —who’s in?\n\n * Will private markets and private sales featured in the upcoming Market\n   Management module improve secondary/private marketplace awareness?\n * Does pegging prices to a volatile coin like PART hurt growth possibilities\n   versus introducing a stable coin/fiat pairing?\n * How do vendors promote their products?\n\nAdditional dapps featuring PART\nI think growing our development community outside the primary team is a big\nhurdle we haven’t figured out yet. All our repos are open source and there for\nimprovements by anyone at anytime.\n\n * What type of incentive structure can be established to spur on new developers\n   joining the mission of Particl?\n * Can community funding (kickstarter-like) campaigns usher in more ideas,\n   initiatives, opportunities that the team frankly hasn’t even considered or\n   thought of yet?\n * What is the timeline on a simple SDK toolset with documentation so\n   development teams looking for a solution like Particl has already built can\n   jump-start their big business idea?\n\nIncreasing the anonymity set\nPrivacy projects are always fighting among themselves as to who is the best (of\ncourse except us — of course ?). There’s pros and cons on each out there. The\nreal winners are projects that actually code, the real losers are projects that\njust copy other work and turn around an claim to be somehow better. That said,\nprivacy gets better on chain on every solution with a larger anonymity set.\nThat’s the coins in the most private state — Anon for PART. Monero potentially\nwins this battle and can lay claim to the most private coin. They can thank\nbeing private-by-default for that. It forces users to always be in the most\nprivate state of coin, thus increasing the anonymity set.\n\nThis is why, ultimately, the Open Marketplace is private-by-default. The whole\nnetwork of users, even if you never #sellstuff4crypto\n[https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23sellstuff4crypto] on the marketplace, benefits\nfrom everyone else’s private PARTs.\n\n<!-- That came out weird, but I like it, I’ll keep it in here. -->\n\n * Can staking be advanced to include fully anon PART by default?\n * Would 3rd party services be open to accepting transfers with stealth\n   addresses and private addresses?\n * Is there a future where everything on PART chain is private-by-default?\n * Is it even desirable?\n\nFinally the private review identified 3 milestones Particl should emphatically\nconsider to drive more interest from services, partners and exchanges.\n\nAgain, I think these are great goals and 1,000% achievable with an army of\npassionate users. The louder and louder we become, the simpler the path to\nadoption becomes.\n\nReach 2,500 average daily product listings for one month\n * Currently, we are around 500+ listings and growing.\n\nReach 25,000 total Particl Desktop & Desktop core downloads\n * Currently, we are around 17,000 downloads combined.\n\nPublic reviews for the Marketplace\n * These reviews can be on YouTube, Twitter, Medium, etc\n\nIf you haven’t taken the time to read the latest updates from the team, please\nadd the most recent posts from Crypto Guard [https://medium.com/u/2be55e0c3a02] \nto your reading list. There’s a lot to get excited about this year.

This isn’t early crypto anymore when innovative projects were\nrewarded with exposure and growth simply based on development accomplishments.\nIn reality, what the blockchain community is still looking for, even after all\nthese years, is the metaphorical “killer app”, that first blockchain product\nthat will significantly improve on something concrete and bring the masses on\nboard. In other words, it is looking for blockchain to cause a paradigm shift.\n\nIn fact, the crypto community has more or less “seen it all”, especially\nconsidering the large number of projects that have fundraised millions of\ndollars based on bold promises but haven’t delivered a single thing yet. And\neven those projects that have delivered live blockchain products have seen very\nlittle adoption from anyone outside the few crypto hobbyists. The reason for\nthat is actually pretty simple — crypto’s “killer app” is still missing and\nnowhere to be found.\n\n“Isn’t Particl THE Killer App”?\nWith that in mind, many within Particl’s community would be fast to point out\nthat Particl’s Open Marketplace is just that — crypto’s killer app. After all,\nit offers a LOT of benefits that simply cannot, by design, be offered by the\nmore traditional online marketplaces currently in existence…and that’s all\nthanks to blockchain and distributed technologies. It charges no commission and \nbarely any fee at all, is inherently private by default, provably secures your\ndata by completely getting rid of third-parties, requires no sign-up, no login, \nno personal or business information, is censorship-proof, free to use, and works\nfrom anywhere in the world as long as you can connect to the internet. In fewer\nwords, it completely redefines the very nature of eCommerce by taking it through\nthe evolutionary path and making it much better. And that simply wouldn’t be\npossible without blockchain and the other novel distributed technologies\nemployed by the Particl platform.\n\nSo why isn’t Particl getting more adoption? Why isn’t Particl the new hot\nmarketplace on the web? To understand why that is, it is important to look at it\nfrom a different perspective, one that’s not coming from a hardcore\ncryptocurrency enthusiast.\n\nThis is precisely what this article is going to breakdown. What are the\nmarketplace’s current pain points? What are some of its obstacles to adoption\nstill standing to this day? How can these be fixed or eliminated so that any\neffort towards user adoption starts yielding positive results? Get prepared,\nbecause this is the last blog post before Particl’s reveal of the new\ndevelopment roadmap. This article is intended to give the precise reasoning\nbehind the roadmap’s visions and will explain the team’s strategy moving\nforward, WITH adoption in mind. Now let’s get to it!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s the Marketplace’s Current Stage of Development?\nWarning Banner Header on Particl DesktopBefore getting into the finer details,\nwe first need to understand a very important fact — Particl’s Open Marketplace\nis still in its Beta phase, meaning it is still early software that’s in its\ntesting/development phase. It is not a final product, far from that, and that’s\ntrue even though it is currently running on mainnet.\n\nWhile Particl Desktop is certainly one of the most appealing crypto wallets out\nthere, and while the Open Marketplace itself is pretty impressive for a live\nblockchain product, it is still missing key features intended for its final\nversion. It is also relatively complex to use for most people (in this case,\nthink in terms of “non-crypto users”), both of which make adoption a real\nchallenge.\n\nThat, alone, explains the marketplace’s relatively low level of adoption\ncompared to traditional online marketplaces. Particl’s current users can still\ndefinitely be considered as pioneers, and perhaps still at this point, testers.\nOnly once Particl gets “adoption-ready” will it start seeing any significant\nincrease in the levels of adoption.\n\nBut the same key question remains — how do we make that marketplace\nadoption-ready? The answer is more obvious than it may seem — you just gotta fix\nwhat makes people NOT want to use it, and then, once that’s done, you can start\nreaching out to people and actually expect a decent “lead conversion rate”, aka\nthe number of people you reach out to that convert into marketplace users.\n\nWhat are the Marketplace’s Current Pain Points?\nThe first step to increase the marketplace’s adoption is to first understand\nwhat’s preventing it from getting said adoption. What could be better? What’s\nmissing? To that end, the Particl team has recently received a feedback report\nfrom a very prominent crypto company\n[https://particl.news/bounding-forward-quality-feedback-from-a-private-peer-review-51e2e9c72fb7] \nwhich ended up being directly in line with what had been observed by the Particl\nteam itself.\n\nAs it currently stands, the reasons can mostly be separated into 4 different\ncategories:\n\n * Missing features\n\nBecause Particl is not a final product yet and still in Beta, it is in no way \nfeature complete [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_complete]. That means a\nlot of features simply aren’t ready or even started yet. These features could be\ntools that make sellers’ life easier, indicators that help buyers make\nbetter-informed purchasing decisions, etc.\n\nAnd while the release of Market Management will mark the end of an important\ndevelopment phase for the marketplace, one that was mostly focused on developing\nthe base layer of what the marketplace was always intended to be when Particl\nwas first launched, the next phase that will then begin will also have its load\nof very important features, although they might not impact the overall structure\nof the marketplace the same way Market Management will.\n\nAnd even then, once Market Management and other features will release, they\nprobably will have to be improved further moving ahead in time. Which brings us\nto the second category…\n\n * Required improvements on some features/functions\n\nReleasing a feature is something. Making sure it’s as efficient and smooth as it\nneeds to be is another. That much is made pretty evident with the major\nrefactoring of the marketplace that is currently underway and will hit mainnet\non the same release as the Market Management. Indeed, it is expected to\nsignificantly improve the marketplace’s performance, make it much lighter, and\nwill also noticeably change the look and feel of it. Not surprising when you\nlearn the update introducing Market Management touches around 80% or more of\nParticl’s marketplace components…\n\nAs time goes by, developers figure out more efficient ways to implement features\nand functions. The process of making those changes, after a feature is released,\nis called “refactoring [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring]”. Code\nrefactoring is also important when introducing new, major features that touch\ncomponents also touched by other previously released features. That’s to make\nsure the code’s health remains good and that the network doesn’t end up being a\nbig pile of spaghetti code [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code].\n\nBut more specifically in the context of user adoption, features that are already\nout or about to be released may need improvements moving forward before they\nbecome user-friendly. Additionally, features may be released in many different\nphases, first bringing the base layer for it, and then improving on it by adding\nmore functionalities and efficiency in following updates.\n\n * Required improvements on the marketplace’s performance and stability\n\nSometimes, the required improvements can be harder to pinpoint because they are\nnot directly related to specific features or functions. That’s because it may be\nthe whole back-end that requires some refactoring and improvements. While these\nchanges are more difficult to track and, at times, to even feel their impact, it\ndefinitely shows over multiple releases, each containing its own set of general\nimprovements.\n\nThose improvements are what make the marketplace generally faster. They are what\nmakes listings sync up more quickly, what makes listing fees smaller, what makes\nloading times shorter, etc.\n\nIt’s easy to overlook this particular category. After all, it’s a normal reflex\nto be thinking that once all the key features are in place, the product is ready\nto market. But there is much more than that, and each feature needs to be\nappropriately integrated and feel right before it can be considered as ready.\n\nConsidering that today’s traditional online marketplaces are built on the web,\nand also because most people access those with pretty decent internet\nconnections, speed and “hassle-free” user experience is expected from both\nsellers and buyers now more than ever. Even more so, users will generally be\nwilling to spend a little more if it means simpler and more pleasant user\nexperience. Which leads us to the fourth and final category…\n\n * Required improvements to the user interface (UI) and experience (UX)\n\n“UI/UX is everything”, or so… Referring to the previous statement, “users will\ngenerally be willing to spend a little more if it means a simpler and more\npleasant user experience”.\n\nOf course, UI/UX is not the only thing that matters, but it is what glues\neverything together so that it makes sense and just feels right. You can have\nall the features in the world, but if they are displayed confusingly or\nunpleasantly, people will generally not even bother. That becomes even truer as\na product’s learning curve gets steeper.\n\nThe reason behind this is mostly due to time constraints and the over-saturation\nof options available to users. Especially in the case of marketplaces — there\nare hundreds, if not thousands of them. Even if a marketplace’s value\nproposition is significant, it’s pretty hard to change people’s habits and get\nthem to move from a marketplace they know and feel comfortable using to one that\nis complicated to understand and doesn’t look as good (it’s pretty fair to\nsay…looks do matter).\n\nSo, is Particl’s Open Marketplace complicated to use? The answer might be “no”\nto you, but be assured it’s probably a resounding “YES” for most people you\nknow. So how do you make these people leap forward and into this new age for\nonline marketplaces? You gotta make sure that each of these 4 categories is\nbeing taken care of by the development team and bring the marketplace to a point\nthat it may finally be considered “adoption-ready”.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2020, Let’s Tackle Those Issues!\nNow that we know where lies the adoption hurdles for Particl’s Open Marketplace,\nit’s now time to strategize and plan around those. As such, the Particl team has\ncrafted a brand new development roadmap for 2020 and beyond. With adoption in\nmind, each of the roadmap items has been carefully selected to eliminate what\nwould make people not want to use the marketplace. There is one specific reason\nbehind each of these items.\n\nIt’s important to understand, though, that the 4 categories mentioned above are\ntightly intertwined. For example, you can’t spend too much time on UI/UX when\nthe marketplace may still significantly change structure as it will with the\nintegration of Market Management. But you should still do a little, as long as\nyou keep development hours wastes at a minimum. This is why Particl’s\ndevelopment team is focusing on these 4 categories as the underlying line of\nthinking behind the new roadmap’s content.\n\nThe Time to Reveal the New Roadmap is NOW ?\nYes indeed, the time to reveal the new roadmap has arrived! We now know just \nhow\nmuch has been done in 2019\n[https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819], how far has\nthe marketplace has progressed since releasing on mainnet\n[https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02],\nand what are the reasons it’s not been getting more adoption up until now. We\nare now equipped with all the tools to fully understand the reasoning behind the\nitems included in the new roadmap.\n\nWith that being said, you can safely expect the new roadmap to be revealed next\nweek, with its full and detailed breakdown being published on Particl.news\n[http://Particl.news].\n\nAs Market Management comes out in the next few weeks and with the new roadmap\ngiving a clear indication of the way forward for the project, the entire Particl\nteam is more than excited for what lies ahead of us all.

It allows online sellers and buyers to connect\ndirectly with each other, without requiring any sort of middleman assistance\n(i.e. a company operating an online marketplace), and conduct business without\nthe usual costs associated with selling and buying online such as transaction\nfees, sales commissions, marketplace subscriptions, currency conversions, and\netc.\n\nAdditionally, the marketplace is also built using various security and\nprivacy-enhancing technologies so that no data (i.e. sales data) or personal\ninformation can be collected by any outside party, a particularly important perk\nin an age where data mining, monetization, breaches, and leaks have become far\ntoo common. Equally as important, better privacy within the eCommerce industry\nundoubtedly leads to better business and competitive practices as well as a more\nfair environment for sellers.\n\nOn top of that combination of near-zero cost and superior data security, the\nmarketplace requires no sign-up, no login, no personal or business information,\nis censorship-proof, free to use, and works from any country in the world, as\nlong as you can connect to the internet.\n\nQuite simply, there is not a single marketplace on the web offering such an\nambitious and novel combination of features. The reason for it is also quite\nsimple to understand — getting this full set of features packaged into a\nmarketplace requires the use of various novel distributed and privacy-preserving\nprotocols that have only recently been made available to developers across the\nworld.\n\nA Novel, Never-Been-Done-Before Concept\nAs a very obvious example of this, let’s take just one component that makes up\nParticl’s marketplace — its automated double deposit escrow system. Particl’s\nescrow system works on smart-contract functionalities and requires a combination\nof RingCT and CT cryptocurrency transactions so that any transaction information\nbetween a buyer and seller remains only known to these two transacting parties.\nIn other words, it makes escrow transactions completely untraceable and\nunlinkable to any party not associated with a particular marketplace\ntransaction.\n\nAnd while RingCT has been available, on Monero, for a few years now, it never\nwas built in a way that it could be used in smart-contracts. Additionally, most\nof the other currently available privacy protocols simply weren’t programmable\n(can’t be used in smart-contracts) or simply weren’t realistically scalable\nenough to make sense to use as part of a marketplace product. For this reason,\nthe Particl team had to build its own custom implementation of RingCT (and\nbulletproofs) so that it could be used by decentralized applications on the\nParticl network, and that’s only been available for a few months.\n\nThis is just one isolated example of technology that became available just\nrecently. Particl’s entire platform is composed of such novel components, and so\nit’s no wonder that there is still no marketplace in existence currently\noffering the same combination of perks as Particl does.\n\nPioneering Takes Time, Efforts, and a Solid Vision\nBut being at the edge of technology also has its drawbacks. After all, Particl’s\nmarketplace is still early Beta software and isn’t really the simplest\nmarketplace to use out there. It really works, but it simply can’t realistically\nbe expected to be adopted by any sort of “mainstream” type of user.\n\nIt does provide many benefits that are very real, but the technical knowledge\nand the learning curve required to even use it is still relatively steep. That’s\none of the biggest obstacles currently standing in Particl’s way when it comes\nto the adoption of the marketplace.\n\nBut rest assured, that is perfectly normal for any new technology that’s as\ngroundbreaking as Particl’s marketplace and uses technologies that have only\nbeen made available for a short time. It takes time to disrupt an industry\nthat’s as competitive as the eCommerce sector, and it also takes time for brand\nnew types of technologies to mature up to the point where most people feel\ncomfortable using it. Remember the advent of the internet in the early '90s?\n\nThe Particl team is indeed well aware of the marketplace’s current lack of\n“mainstream” appeal. Most of the features, functions, and general user\nexperience that would actually be expected from your typical marketplace user\n(think your parents, significant other, or friends that aren’t as “crypto crazy”\nas we all are) are still being built, and they’ve been nicely incorporated into\nthe new Particl 2020 development roadmap.\n\nSome of the additions required to make the marketplace more\n“mainstream-appealing” have already been deployed since first releasing the\nmarketplace on mainnet and can be used by anyone at this very moment. They are\neither features, improvements, or important functions that help make a buyer or\nseller’s life easier. Let’s review what these improvements and additions are and\nsee how has Particl’s marketplace evolved over the last few months.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow Has the Marketplace Evolved Since Launch?\nNot only has the marketplace consistently been pushing its all-time high number\nof listings higher and higher [https://www.demarkets.io/stats], but the number\nof mainnet transactions on the Particl network has also seen a\ndramatic rise [https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/#!overview], now averaging more\nthan 200 transactions per day. These transactions include listed items, escrow\ntransactions, the flagging of items, created and votes on community proposals,\nbalance transfers, and regular currency transactions.\n\nAdditionally, and perhaps even more importantly, the Particl network has been\ngetting much more private! Indeed, the network’s “anon set”, the number of\nRingCT outputs available to anonymize transactions, has been growing\nexponentially since the launch of the Open Marketplace, averaging a steady 30%\nor more increase per month. The anon set currently stands at 5232, a whopping\n149% increase since August 2019. To observe that value goes up and down by\nyourself, just open up your Particl Desktop wallet and type anonoutput in the\nconsole window. As the Open Marketplace and the Particl network gets more\nadoption, you can expect that number to keep rising, meaning RingCT transactions\nwill keep on getting more private.\n\nMore Tools and Features Made Available\nParticl’s Open Marketplace is still Beta software, meaning it is still very much\na work-in-progress and under heavy development. As such, it is normal that some\nof the intended features for its first “final” version are still missing to this\nday. The good thing, though, is that these features and improvements are coming\nup quite quickly!\n\nEver since the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace on the 12th of August,\n2019, we’ve seen these improvements go live…\n\n * Import products (bulk listing)\n\nThis feature allows sellers to import products from outside sources such as .csv\nfiles and WooCommerce stores. It is particularly useful to manage large\ninventories and list items in bulk. This feature is ultimately designed to reach\nits full potential when used in combination with the upcoming Market Management\n[https://particl.news/market-management-is-next-3e35356d5de0] and Inventory\nManagement tools.\n\n * Public comments (Q&A)\n\nThis feature allows anyone to leave a comment, review, feedback, or question on\nany listing posted on the Open Marketplace. Leaving a post notifies the seller\nof the item which can then respond. Posts made by the seller of an item are\nclearly identified as such. This feature is intended to better help you make\nbetter shopping decisions and know more about the items you’re looking to buy. \nPublic comments will tie in nicely with future reputation models intended to be\nimplemented at a later stage during the Beta stage of development.\n\n * Cancel bids\n\nIt used to be impossible to cancel an order before the seller accepted it,\nmeaning funds could get stuck in limbo when sellers were inactive and not\nprocessing orders. While it was possible to manually unlock these coins, it did\nrequire a fair bit of technical knowledge about the Particl platform itself. Far\nfrom ideal! This is why an update was made to the marketplace to add this\nimportant functionality.\n\n * Settings page\n\nThe first iteration of the Settings page has been added a few weeks after the\nlaunch of the Open Marketplace Beta. While it currently only contains basic\nsettings such as notification management and wallet backup options, the Settings\npage will play a bigger role once Market Management and other future major\nfeatures are integrated.\n\n * In-wallet Bitcoin exchange\n\nThis major and exciting update to Particl Desktop added the ability to swap\nBitcoin for Particl right inside the wallet. This means anyone can now “top up”\ntheir Open Marketplace account using Bitcoin. No need to register on an exchange\nor give away your personal information (i.e. KYC, IP address, etc), and it works\neverywhere, even in the US!\n\nThis exchange module is currently powered by the SMSG network and connects\ndirectly to the SimpleSwap [http://simpleswap.io] exchange, but is built in such\na way that it can integrate almost any exchange or service provider as long as\nthe required APIs are provided by the third-party. This update was very\nimportant as it opens the door for Particl to be adopted outside of its own\ncommunity by accepting a varied list of currencies.\n\n * Bot Management\n\nThe Bot Management feature was introduced at the same time as the Bitcoin\nExchange module was. It is, in fact, what powers it. The Bot Management feature\nallows you to use and list SMSG bots that provide added third-party services to\nParticl Desktop. These added services can be bridges to crypto exchanges or fiat\npayment gateways, as well as many other sorts of services.\n\nHowever, because this is the first iteration of the feature, it is currently not\npossible to manually add your bot to the list of available bots. That’s because\nsecurity measures still need to be put in place to make sure people do not push\nmalicious bots on the network. The Bot Management tool is planned to be an\nintegral part of the upcoming developer SDK.\n\n * SMSG improvements\n\nSMSG is the P2P network that powers the Open Marketplace. It securely and\nprivately hosts data (i.e. listing images and descriptions) and makes several\nprocesses possible such as displaying listings, flagging items, exchanging\nBitcoin for Particl, and etc. It is the backbone of the entire Particl\necosystem.\n\nSince the marketplace’s mainnet launch, the SMSG network has seen its\nperformance vastly improved, notably with how effectively it displays listings\nand communicates between peers. Improving SMSG will be an ongoing process as we\nmove forward through the Beta phase of development.\n\n * Significantly reduced listing fees\n\nOne of the big updates that were made to the SMSG network is the ability for\nstakers to signal lower listing fees to the network. What that means is that\nanyone staking on the Particl network can have a say on how much the network\ncharges users for publishing listings on the Open Marketplace.\n\nAs a result, ever since the launch of the Beta, listing fees have been reduced\nby a big fat 53%! This is already great, making it much cheaper for sellers to\nlist items, but fees are also expected to go down even more, by at least 80%, in\nthe next SMSG update. That’s what near-zero cost eCommerce means!\n\n * Various improvements, tweaks, and fixes based on user suggestions\n\nOn top of everything mentioned above, a LOT of tweaks, fixes, and improvements\nhave been made to both the code and the user experience of Particl Desktop and\nthe Open Marketplace. A lot of these changes have been made based on user\nfeedback, and it is the one reason why the “Report bug” button has been added at\nthe bottom left of the Particl Desktop client. All user feedback is very\nimportant and really makes it easier for Particl developers to see what areas\nneed to be improved or tweaked. The more feedback is received, the faster issues\ncan be addressed. For this reason, it is highly recommended to be pro-active in\nreporting issues and making suggestions on Github.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith all of the above in mind, it is clear that Particl’s marketplace is getting\nbetter and easier to use by the day. Of course, there is still some stuff\nmissing or that could be improved, but that’s more than normal given the Beta\nnature of the product.\n\nSo what’s left to do? What is the marketplace missing? What could be improved to\nbe able to attract a wider range of users and make sure they remain users over a\nlonger period of time?\n\nThat’s what we’ll be exploring later this week in a future article published\nhere at Particl.news [http://Particl.news]. These are all questions that the\nteam has asked itself recently, along with a few community contributors, and\nwhich resulted in a brand new (and dare I say…exciting!) development roadmap. \nWatch out for next week, because that’s when the new development roadmap will be\npublicly revealed!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-Progress-So-Far/1-l9wIwdXxGp6dWHRnhXfqPQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"it-s-almost-time-for-particl-to-shine-\">It’s almost time for Particl to shine! ?</h3><p>The Beta version of Particl’s Open Marketplace has been out for a few months now, and it’s been evolving pretty nicely ever since.

It allows online sellers and buyers to connect directly with each other, without requiring any sort of middleman assistance (i.e. a company operating an online marketplace), and conduct business without the usual costs associated with selling and buying online such as transaction fees, sales commissions, marketplace subscriptions, currency conversions, and etc.</p><p>Additionally, the marketplace is also built using various security and privacy-enhancing technologies so that no data (i.e. sales data) or personal information can be collected by any outside party, a particularly important perk in an age where data mining, monetization, breaches, and leaks have become far too common. Equally as important, better privacy within the eCommerce industry undoubtedly leads to better business and competitive practices as well as a more fair environment for sellers.</p><p>On top of that combination of near-zero cost and superior data security, the marketplace requires no sign-up, no login, no personal or business information, is censorship-proof, free to use, and works from any country in the world, as long as you can connect to the internet.</p><p>Quite simply, there is not a single marketplace on the web offering such an ambitious and novel combination of features. The reason for it is also quite simple to understand — getting this full set of features packaged into a marketplace requires the use of various novel distributed and privacy-preserving protocols that have only recently been made available to developers across the world.</p><h3 id=\"a-novel-never-been-done-before-concept\">A Novel, Never-Been-Done-Before Concept</h3><p>As a very obvious example of this, let’s take just one component that makes up Particl’s marketplace — its automated double deposit escrow system. Particl’s escrow system works on smart-contract functionalities and <strong>requires a combination of RingCT and CT cryptocurrency transactions</strong> so that any transaction information between a buyer and seller remains only known to these two transacting parties. In other words, it makes escrow transactions completely untraceable and unlinkable to any party not associated with a particular marketplace transaction.</p><p>And while RingCT has been available, on Monero, for a few years now, it never was built in a way that it could be used in smart-contracts. Additionally, most of the other currently available privacy protocols simply weren’t programmable (can’t be used in smart-contracts) or simply weren’t realistically scalable enough to make sense to use as part of a marketplace product. For this reason, the Particl team had to build its own custom implementation of RingCT (and bulletproofs) so that it could be used by decentralized applications on the Particl network, and that’s only been available for a few months.</p><p>This is just one isolated example of technology that became available just recently. Particl’s entire platform is composed of such novel components, and so it’s no wonder that there is still no marketplace in existence currently offering the same combination of perks as Particl does.</p><h3 id=\"pioneering-takes-time-efforts-and-a-solid-vision\">Pioneering Takes Time, Efforts, and a Solid Vision</h3><p>But being at the edge of technology also has its drawbacks. After all, Particl’s marketplace is still early Beta software and isn’t really the simplest marketplace to use out there. It really works, but it simply can’t realistically be expected to be adopted by any sort of “mainstream” type of user.</p><p>It does provide many benefits that are very real, but the technical knowledge and the learning curve required to even use it is still relatively steep. That’s one of the biggest obstacles currently standing in Particl’s way when it comes to the adoption of the marketplace.</p><p>But rest assured, that is perfectly normal for any new technology that’s as groundbreaking as Particl’s marketplace and uses technologies that have only been made available for a short time. It takes time to disrupt an industry that’s as competitive as the eCommerce sector, and it also takes time for brand new types of technologies to mature up to the point where most people feel comfortable using it. Remember the advent of the internet in the early '90s?</p><p>The Particl team is indeed well aware of the marketplace’s current lack of “mainstream” appeal. Most of the features, functions, and general user experience that would actually be expected from your typical marketplace user (think your parents, significant other, or friends that aren’t as “crypto crazy” as we all are) are still being built, and they’ve been nicely incorporated into the new Particl 2020 development roadmap.</p><p>Some of the additions required to make the marketplace more “mainstream-appealing” have already been deployed since first releasing the marketplace on mainnet and can be used by anyone at this very moment. They are either features, improvements, or important functions that help make a buyer or seller’s life easier. Let’s review what these improvements and additions are and see how has Particl’s marketplace evolved over the last few months.</p><hr><h2 id=\"how-has-the-marketplace-evolved-since-launch\">How Has the Marketplace Evolved Since Launch?</h2><p>Not only has the marketplace <a href=\"https://www.demarkets.io/stats\">consistently been pushing its <strong>all-time high number of listings</strong> higher and higher</a>, but <a href=\"https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/#!overview\">the <strong>number of mainnet transactions on the Particl network has also seen a dramatic rise</strong></a>, now averaging more than 200 transactions per day. These transactions include listed items, escrow transactions, the flagging of items, created and votes on community proposals, balance transfers, and regular currency transactions.</p><p>Additionally, and perhaps even more importantly, <strong>the Particl network has been getting much more private</strong>! Indeed, the network’s “<strong>anon set</strong>”, the number of RingCT outputs available to anonymize transactions, has been growing exponentially since the launch of the Open Marketplace, averaging a <strong>steady 30% or more increase per month</strong>. The anon set currently stands at 5232, a whopping 149% increase since August 2019. To observe that value goes up and down by yourself, just open up your Particl Desktop wallet and type anonoutput in the console window. As the Open Marketplace and the Particl network gets more adoption, you can expect that number to keep rising, meaning RingCT transactions will keep on getting more private.</p><h2 id=\"more-tools-and-features-made-available\">More Tools and Features Made Available</h2><p>Particl’s Open Marketplace is still Beta software, meaning it is still very much a work-in-progress and under heavy development. As such, it is normal that some of the intended features for its first “final” version are still missing to this day. The good thing, though, is that these features and improvements are coming up quite quickly!</p><p>Ever since the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace on the 12th of August, 2019, we’ve seen these improvements go live…</p><ul><li><strong>Import products (bulk listing)</strong></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-Progress-So-Far/1-6OzrmrlZyD70STSd3qalJQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>This feature allows sellers to <strong>import products from outside sources</strong> such as .csv files and WooCommerce stores. It is particularly useful to <strong>manage large inventories</strong> and <strong>list items in bulk</strong>. This feature is ultimately designed to reach its full potential when used in combination with the upcoming <a href=\"https://particl.news/market-management-is-next-3e35356d5de0\"><strong>Market Management</strong></a> and <strong>Inventory Management</strong> tools.</p><ul><li><strong>Public comments (Q&#x26;A)</strong></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-Progress-So-Far/1-B_MoI8All6pasNe7Bht7CA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>This feature allows anyone to <strong>leave a comment, review, feedback, or question on any listing</strong> posted on the Open Marketplace. Leaving a post notifies the seller of the item which can then respond. Posts made by the seller of an item are clearly identified as such. This feature is intended to better help you make better shopping decisions and know more about the items you’re looking to buy. <strong>Public comments will tie in nicely with future reputation models</strong> intended to be implemented at a later stage during the Beta stage of development.</p><ul><li><strong>Cancel bids</strong></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-Progress-So-Far/1-PPj8p8kjjfVsguxanMHIJA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>It used to be impossible to cancel an order before the seller accepted it, meaning funds could get stuck in limbo when sellers were inactive and not processing orders. While it was possible to manually unlock these coins, it did require a fair bit of technical knowledge about the Particl platform itself. Far from ideal! This is why an update was made to the marketplace to add this important functionality.</p><ul><li><strong>Settings page</strong></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-Progress-So-Far/1-V2s_ynpbpUpMDqb5VTfYkw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>The first iteration of the Settings page has been added a few weeks after the launch of the Open Marketplace Beta. While it currently only contains basic settings such as notification management and wallet backup options, the Settings page will play a bigger role once Market Management and other future major features are integrated.</p><ul><li><strong>In-wallet Bitcoin exchange</strong></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-Progress-So-Far/1-DUg2gAjvJRbh6T2T0c7n9Q.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>This major and exciting update to Particl Desktop added the ability to <strong>swap Bitcoin for Particl</strong> right inside the wallet. This means anyone can now “top up” their Open Marketplace account using Bitcoin. <strong>No need to register on an exchange or give away your personal information</strong> (i.e. KYC, IP address, etc), and it works everywhere, even in the US!</p><p>This exchange module is currently powered by the SMSG network and connects directly to the <a href=\"http://simpleswap.io\"><strong>SimpleSwap</strong></a> exchange, but is built in such a way that it can integrate almost any exchange or service provider as long as the required APIs are provided by the third-party. This update was very important as it opens the door for Particl to be adopted outside of its own community by accepting a varied list of currencies.</p><ul><li><strong>Bot Management</strong></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-Progress-So-Far/1-jw4vyiR1I99aRdq_J6zaiQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>The Bot Management feature was introduced at the same time as the Bitcoin Exchange module was. It is, in fact, what powers it. The Bot Management feature allows you to<strong> use and list SMSG bots that provide added third-party services</strong> to Particl Desktop. These added services can be <strong>bridges to crypto exchanges</strong> or <strong>fiat payment gateways</strong>, as well as many other sorts of services.</p><p>However, because this is the first iteration of the feature, it is currently not possible to manually add your bot to the list of available bots. That’s because security measures still need to be put in place to make sure people do not push malicious bots on the network. The Bot Management tool is planned to be an integral part of the upcoming developer SDK.</p><ul><li><strong>SMSG improvements</strong></li></ul><p>SMSG is the P2P network that powers the Open Marketplace. It securely and privately hosts data (i.e. listing images and descriptions) and makes several processes possible such as displaying listings, flagging items, exchanging Bitcoin for Particl, and etc. It is the backbone of the entire Particl ecosystem.</p><p>Since the marketplace’s mainnet launch, the SMSG network has seen its performance vastly improved, notably with how effectively it displays listings and communicates between peers. Improving SMSG will be an ongoing process as we move forward through the Beta phase of development.</p><ul><li><strong>Significantly reduced listing fees</strong></li></ul><p>One of the big updates that were made to the SMSG network is the ability for stakers to signal lower listing fees to the network. What that means is that anyone staking on the Particl network can have a say on how much the network charges users for publishing listings on the Open Marketplace.</p><p>As a result, ever since the launch of the Beta, <strong>listing fees have been reduced by a big fat 53%</strong>! This is already great, making it much cheaper for sellers to list items, but fees are also expected to<strong> go down even more, by at least 80%</strong>, in the next SMSG update. That’s what <strong>near-zero cost eCommerce</strong> means!</p><ul><li><strong>Various improvements, tweaks, and fixes based on user suggestions</strong></li></ul><p>On top of everything mentioned above, a LOT of tweaks, fixes, and improvements have been made to both the code and the user experience of Particl Desktop and the Open Marketplace. A lot of these changes have been made based on user feedback, and it is the one reason why the “Report bug” button has been added at the bottom left of the Particl Desktop client. All user feedback is very important and really makes it easier for Particl developers to see what areas need to be improved or tweaked. The more feedback is received, the faster issues can be addressed. For this reason, it is highly recommended to be pro-active in reporting issues and making suggestions on Github.</p><hr><p>With all of the above in mind, it is clear that Particl’s marketplace is getting better and easier to use by the day. Of course, there is still some stuff missing or that could be improved, but that’s more than normal given the Beta nature of the product.</p><p>So what’s left to do? What is the marketplace missing? What could be improved to be able to attract a wider range of users and make sure they remain users over a longer period of time?</p><p><strong>That’s what we’ll be exploring later this week in a future article published here at </strong><a href=\"http://Particl.news\"><strong>Particl.news</strong></a><strong>.</strong> These are all questions that the team has asked itself recently, along with a few community contributors, and which resulted in a brand new (and dare I say…exciting!) development roadmap. <strong>Watch out for next week, because that’s when the new development roadmap will be publicly revealed!</strong></p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-Progress-So-Far/1-mclmOaKPQAUhM0MVkWrK0A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":["kg-card","kg-image-card","kg-width-wide"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-Progress-So-Far/1-l9wIwdXxGp6dWHRnhXfqPQ.jpeg","className":["kg-image"],"alt":""},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"it-s-almost-time-for-particl-to-shine-"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"It’s almost time for Particl to shine! ?"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The Beta version of Particl’s Open Marketplace has been out for a few months now, and it’s been evolving pretty nicely ever since.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all.
