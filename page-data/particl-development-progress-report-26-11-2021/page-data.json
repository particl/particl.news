As a reminder, this feature was heavily requested by some\nof the sellers that currently list multiple listings at once. Additionally, an\nimprovement has been made to the marketplace's search engine to prevent it, in\nsome cases, from displaying expired listings. Other than that, a few other\nmiscellaneous fixes have been included in the code, as is a usual occurrence. \n\nAt this time, the focus, concerning Particl Desktop, is on finishing up the\nalternative shipping option feature (the ability to provide another method of\ndelivery other than a physical shipping address). Because this requires multiple\nchanges to all components of the marketplace (Particl Desktop, Particl\nMarketplace, and the OMP Library), this is expected to last for the next week or\ntwo. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Report\n * Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address\n   requirement (i.e., download links, crypto addresses for NFTs, user codes,\n   etc.).

This task is, however, complete as of\nright now.\n\nAs for BasicSwap, we've released, earlier today, a blog post\n[https://particl.news/introducing-particls-basicswap-dex/] on Particl News that\nexplains what it is, what it does, what makes it unique, and what's the bigger\nvision for it.

It contains valuable information still\nvalid to this day regarding adjusting the listing fees of Particl Marketplace.\nPlease consult the table of contents to jump to the relevant section or click\nhere.\nOn the 12th of August 2019, the Particl Open Marketplace launched live on\nmainnet\n[https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-is-now-live-on-mainnet-bed75988b690]\n. This gave the ability for anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and\nservices without requiring the assistance of any third-party and without leaving\nany data trail behind. This was a big milestone and disruption within the\neCommerce space, but it’s important to remind ourselves that the Open\nMarketplace is still a Beta piece of software.\n\nThat means there are still ways to go before the Open Marketplace is ready for\nmass adoption and the on-boarding of a more mainstream audience. That also means\nthis current Beta period is extremely important — it serves as the perfect\ntesting ground to try the platform and see what’s missing and what could be\nimproved.\n\nIndeed, the Particl network needs you now more than it ever did. As the\ncommunity of users grows, so will the amount of collected feedback and different\nperspectives. In any case, more feedback is always good and helps highlight more\nquickly what the platform is doing right or wrong.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Content (Click me)\n * Dynamic Listing Fees\n * Why are Listing Fees Needed\n * High Listing Fees vs Low Listing Fees\n * Tutorial — How to Adjust Listing Fees\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDynamic Listing Fees\nOne of the main feedback the Particl team has received a lot since the launch of\nParticl Marketplace is the cost of the listing fees — what you pay to put an\nitem or service up for sale. \n\nLuckily, the Particl network is entirely decentralized; it's controlled by its\ncommunity of users and doesn’t require any party to operate. The same is true\nfor Partic Marketplace, the first official distributed app of the network. \n\nFor this reason, it is entirely possible for stakers to adjust the listing fees\nof the marketplace. It’s also quite easy to do so, and this blog post will walk\nyou through the simple process of doing it. But first, let’s go over the main\nimplications of having listing fees on the marketplace in the first place. That\nwill serve as a good indicator for you to make an informed decision on how much\nyou want to change the listing fees of the network.\n\nWhy are Listing Fees Needed?\nThere are several reasons as to why Particl Marketplace charges fees for listing\nitems. It is usually believed that as few fees as possible, or no fee at all, is\nthe ultimate goal for decentralized marketplaces. It is, of course, a very\nappealing proposition, but it does come with some pretty important trade-offs.\n\nFighting Spam\nThe first obvious use of listing fees is to deter spam on the network. Because\nthere is no central authority governing the Open Marketplace, there isn’t any\nperson with special moderating powers to prevent ill-intended users from\nspamming the marketplace with dummy listings. Particl instead uses listing fees\nto introduce a financial cost behind posting listings. That cost is on the low\nend, but if a spammer starts posting hundreds or thousands of spam listings,\nthen it quickly adds up and ends up being costly for the attacker.\n\nThat’s the main reason why the marketplace charges a listing fee, and it’s the\nsame reason why you have to pay a transaction fee when sending Bitcoin, or\nParticl, to someone. If such fees wouldn’t be in place, then decentralized\nnetworks could fall victim to many kinds of spam attacks with little to no\nrecourse.\n\nKeeping the Marketplace Content Up-to-date \nAnother lesser-known use of listing fees on a decentralized marketplace is to\nkeep it “clean” of old listings that aren’t maintained by sellers anymore.\nThat’s because, once again, there is no central party with special moderation\npowers that can curate content and trim off inactive listings. This can be quite\nproblematic in terms of user experience — imagine yourself placing an order for\na certain product, but never getting your order accepted or rejected by the\nseller. Now imagine the same thing happening 80% of the time you place an order.\nPretty annoying, right?\n\nHow listing fees work on Particl Marketplace is that you pay fees depending on\ntwo factors: the size of your listing (number of images, amount of text, etc)\nand the duration it stays listed on the marketplace. That means the longer you\nset your listing to stay up, the higher the fee is going to be. This system\nworks in keeping the marketplace free of inactive listings by associating a\nfinancial cost to its duration. \n\nTheoretically, if you pay for your listing to stay up for X amount of days, then\nit is more than likely that you will keep an eye on it for the full duration of\nthe listing. Failure to do so would result in a net waste of funds.\n\nIncentivizing Stakers to Secure the Network\nAnother important aspect of the listing fees is in how they help strengthen the\nsecurity of the network by incentivizing stakers to run staking nodes. \n\nIn fact, all Open Marketplace’s listing fees are redistributed, in full, to\nstakers, meaning that as more people use the marketplace, the staking rewards\nwill keep on getting more lucrative. This also not only contributes to getting a\ngreater number of nodes running on the network, but it also helps with the\nnetwork effect of the platform, an important aspect that tremendously helps to\nspread the word around in an organic manner.\n\nHigh Listing Fees vs Low Listing Fees\nBefore you go ahead and adjust how you would like listing fees to be, it is\nimportant to understand the impact behind lowering or increasing them. Some\narguments can be made from both sides, and it is important to be aware of both\nperspectives to make the best-informed decision possible.\n\nLower fees\n * Easier to onboard large scale vendors and lowers the barrier to entry\n * Makes the financial cost of spamming the network smaller\n * Makes the financial cost of not maintaining a listing smaller\n * Smaller increase in staking rewards per listing posted\n\nHigher fees\n * More costly for large scale vendors to post their inventory on the\n   marketplace and higher barrier to entry\n * Makes the financial cost of spamming the network greater\n * Makes the financial cost of not maintaining a listing greater\n * Bigger increase in staking rewards per listing posted\n\nIt’s important to note, though, that lower fees don’t necessarily mean smaller\nstaking rewards for stakers. It does make a smaller increase on staking rewards \nper listing published, but lower fees enable larger sellers to set up shop on\nthe marketplace and post large inventories, potentially leading to more\nindividual listings on the marketplace, leading to bigger staking rewards.\n\nTutorial — How to Adjust Listing Fees\nSo you now have a pretty good idea of how you’d like listing fees to cost but\ndon’t know how to make it happen. You find yourself in the right place! In fact,\nsince Particl Core 0.18.0.10, it has been possible for stakers to broadcast\ntheir target listing fee to the network.\n\nA Community-Powered Tug-of-War\nOne staker obviously cannot single-handedly modify listing fees to whatever he\nwants them to be. That’s because this value is attained through community\nconsensus.\n\nListing fees on Particl are updated every 5,040 blocks, or roughly every week\n(10,080 minutes). This is done according to the consensus established by\nstakers. In between those listing fee updates, the network’s consensus is in a\nconstant state of fee discovery. A target listing fee value (identified by the\nsmsgfeeratetarget parameter) is dynamically adjusted each time a block is\nstaked. Every 5,040 blocks, the fee is adjusted based on the average of all fee\ntargets broadcast by stakers. \n\nThe smsgfeeratetarget can only increase or decrease in small increments. Then,\nonce the 5,040th block is reached, the network looks up at the current\nsmsgfeeratetarget value and makes it its base listing fee until the next 5,040th\nblock.\n\nThis can be seen as a giant game of digital tug-of-war. Each staker broadcasts\nto the network what kind of listing fees it wants to see on the marketplace\n(higher or lower fees?). Then, the smsgfeeratetarget value either trends upwards\nor downwards depending on where the consensus lies. If the majority of stakers\nwant fees to remain the same, then that consensus won’t move by a whole lot. If\nthe majority wants to lower the fees by just a little, the smsgfeeratetarget\nwill slowly trend lower, in small increments. If the majority of stakers want\ndramatically lower listing fees, then smsgfeeratetarget will trend lower at a\nmuch faster pace. In other words, the more people pull the metaphorical rope to\ntheir side, the faster the network’s going to adjust its fees. It is just like a\ndigital game of tug-of-war.\n\n> Note (01-12-2021): The listing fee adjusting feature will be updated and\nimproved in the next hardfork coming in early 2022. While you can adjust the fee\ntarget at this moment, doing so might result only in negligible changes.\nThe fact that smsgfeeratetarget can only trend upwards or downwards in small\nincrements enhances the stability of fees on the marketplace and makes the\nprocess of establishing consensus smoother and less bumpy (less dramatic and\nunpredictable changes).\n\nPut the current value into perspective\nTo get a better understanding of the listing's fee impact we need to put the\ncurrent market price for PART and the use-case of 100 listings per month into\nperspective.\n\nNote: The listing_size is an assumptive averaged number and consists of 2-3\nimages per item and 1000 chars of text.\n\n# Calculations basis\n\nPART_price = $1.00\nfee_rate = 0.00004762\nlisting_size = 500KB\nlisting_days = 30\nlisting_items = 100\n\n# Formula\n\n((((listing_size x fee_rate) * PART_price) * listing days) * listing_items)\n\n((((500 x 0.00004762) * 1.00) * 30) * 100) = $71.43\n\n# Calculations\n\nPART RATE PER DAY \n500x0.00004762 = 0,02381\n\nUSD RATE PER DAY \n0.02381 x 1 = 0.02381\n\nUSD RATE PER MONTH \n0.02381 x 30 = 0.7143\n\nUSD RATE PER MONTH for 100 ITEMS \n0.7143 x 100 = $71.43\n\nIn the example above, a vendor would need to spend $71.43 per month for 100\nlistings. But, of course, no final value fee or any other fees apply to a sale\nwith Particl Marketplace.\n\nNow, we must keep in mind the idea of this listing fee is to fight off spam. So,\nideally, the lowest number possible gets signaled by the community and should\nget increased if it seems needed to fight off spam. This is where your help is\nneeded.\n\nBroadcast a Different Listing Fee Target\nThe way to broadcast your desired smsgfeeratetarget value depends on how you're\ncurrently staking your coins. To broadcast your target, you need to do two\nthings:\n\n * Take note of the current value of smsgfeeratetarget\n * Broadcast your desired target to the network\n\nIf You’re Staking on Either Particl Desktop or Particl-Qt\nIf you are not cold staking your coins and only keeping a Particl wallet\n“unlocked for staking only”, then adjusting your smsgfeeratetarget parameter is\npretty simple. To do so, you first need to know the current value of\nsmsgfeeratetarget so that you can figure out your desired target. \n\nTo do so, simply open up the <console> and enter the smsggetfeerate command.\n\nTyping this command will return the current value of smsgfeeratetarget in the\nconsole window. This is the current base value being used by the marketplace to\nestablish listing fees. In the example illustrated above, this command returns\nthe value 23255. This means the current value of smsgfeerate is 0.00023255. This\nis important to know as it will tell you what value you want to broadcast\ndepending on your preference.\n\nNow you need to broadcast to the network your desired target. To do it, type the\nfollowing command in the console by replacing 0.00000001 with whatever target\nyou want to set.\n\nwalletsettings stakingoptions {\"smsgfeeratetarget\":0.00000001}\n\nFor example, if you would like fees to be 10x lower than 0.00023255, then you\nwould put the value at 0.00002325. If you want to reduce fees by 100x, then\nsimply put the value at 0.00000232. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001. \nNote that your desired value has to be 8 decimals or less.\n\n> Important: If you already have a custom stakingoptions parameter, like a custom \nrewardaddress, for example, then please enter the following command into the\n<console> and replace addr by the rewardaddress you set up previously: \nwalletsettings stakingoptions {\"rewardaddress\": \"addr\",\"smsgfeeratetarget\":0.00000001}\n\nIf You’re Cold Staking Coins on a Staking Node\nIf you cold staking your coins on a staking node you control, then you will need\nto broadcast your listing fee target from the staking node itself. \n\nTo do so, you first need to know the current value of smsgfeeratetarget so that\nyou can figure out your desired target. To do so, simply open up the console and\nenter the following command:\n\n./particlcore/particl-cli smsggetfeerate\n\nTyping this command will return the current value of smsgfeeratetarget in the\nterminal. This is the current base value being used by the marketplace to\nestablish listing fees. \n\nAt the time of writing this blog post, this command returned the value 23255.\nThis means the current value of smsgfeerate is 0.00023255. This is important to\nknow as it will tell you what value you want to broadcast depending on your\npreference. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001.\n\nNow you need to broadcast to the network your desired target. To do it, first\nupdate your partyman application to make sure you are on the latest version:\n\ncd partyman && git pull\n\n Then, open up the smsgfeeratetarget menu by typing this command:\n\n./partyman stakingnode smsgfeeratetarget\n\nThis command will first give you the current value of smsgfeeratetarget that\nyour node broadcasts. It'll then ask you whether you would like to configure a\nnew target or not. If you wish to do so, type y to move forward through the\nprocess. \n\nOnce that is done, the partyman application will prompt you to type in your\ndesired target. Simply write the target you want to broadcast. For example, if\nyou would like fees to be 10x lower than 0.00023255, then you would put the\nvalue at 0.00002325. If you want to reduce fees by 100x, then simply put the\nvalue at 0.00000232. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001. Once you’ve\nchosen and written your new target, press Enter to apply the change and start\nbroadcasting it to the network. Note that your desired value has to be 8\ndecimals or less.\n\nIf You’re Staking on a Cold Staking Pool\nIf you’re staking your coins on a staking pool, then you cannot broadcast your\ndesired target. You will need to either stake your coins on your own staking\nnode or find a staking pool that broadcasts a target that’s close to your\nliking.\n\nIf You’re Operating a Cold Staking Pool\nIf you are the operator of a cold staking pool and want to broadcast a different\ntarget, then simply follow the instructions available on Github by following \nthis link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool/blob/master/doc/set_an_smsg_feerate_target.md]\n.\n\nIf You’re Not Staking\nIf you’re not staking your coins, then you cannot broadcast your target to the\nnetwork. This is a golden opportunity for you to get started with staking and be\npart of Particl’s fully decentralized consensus-finding process. If you want to\nget started with cold staking, simply follow the steps available in this\nParticl\nAcademy tutorial\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/guides/guide_mp_general_enable_staking.html]\n.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow you’re all set to start broadcasting your listing fee target rate to the\nnetwork. Take note that, at this time, the fee adjusting feature is not optimal\nand may result in negligible changes only. In the next hardfork (early 2022),\nthe feature will be significantly improved and made more effective.

But first, let’s go over the main implications of having listing fees on the marketplace in the first place. That will serve as a good indicator for you to make an informed decision on how much you want to change the listing fees of the network.</p><h2 id=\"why-are-listing-fees-needed\">Why are Listing Fees Needed?</h2><p>There are several reasons as to why Particl Marketplace charges fees for listing items. It is usually believed that as few fees as possible, or no fee at all, is the ultimate goal for decentralized marketplaces. It is, of course, a very appealing proposition, but it does come with some pretty important trade-offs.</p><h3 id=\"fighting-spam\">Fighting Spam</h3><p>The first obvious use of listing fees is to deter spam on the network. Because there is no central authority governing the Open Marketplace, there isn’t any person with special moderating powers to prevent ill-intended users from spamming the marketplace with dummy listings. Particl instead uses listing fees to introduce a financial cost behind posting listings. That cost is on the low end, but if a spammer starts posting hundreds or thousands of spam listings, then it quickly adds up and ends up being costly for the attacker.</p><p>That’s the main reason why the marketplace charges a listing fee, and it’s the same reason why you have to pay a transaction fee when sending Bitcoin, or Particl, to someone. If such fees wouldn’t be in place, then decentralized networks could fall victim to many kinds of spam attacks with little to no recourse.</p><h3 id=\"keeping-the-marketplace-content-up-to-date\">Keeping the Marketplace Content Up-to-date </h3><p>Another lesser-known use of listing fees on a decentralized marketplace is to keep it “clean” of old listings that aren’t maintained by sellers anymore. That’s because, once again, there is no central party with special moderation powers that can curate content and trim off inactive listings. This can be quite problematic in terms of user experience — imagine yourself placing an order for a certain product, but never getting your order accepted or rejected by the seller. Now imagine the same thing happening 80% of the time you place an order. Pretty annoying, right?</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/image-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/image-4.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/12/image-4.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/image-4.png 1313w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>How listing fees work on Particl Marketplace is that you pay fees depending on two factors: the size of your listing (number of images, amount of text, etc) and the duration it stays listed on the marketplace. That means the longer you set your listing to stay up, the higher the fee is going to be. This system works in keeping the marketplace free of inactive listings by associating a financial cost to its duration. </p><p>Theoretically, if you pay for your listing to stay up for X amount of days, then it is more than likely that you will keep an eye on it for the full duration of the listing. Failure to do so would result in a net waste of funds.</p><h3 id=\"incentivizing-stakers-to-secure-the-network\">Incentivizing Stakers to Secure the Network</h3><p>Another important aspect of the listing fees is in how they help strengthen the security of the network by incentivizing stakers to run staking nodes. </p><p>In fact, all Open Marketplace’s listing fees are redistributed, in full, to stakers, meaning that as more people use the marketplace, the staking rewards will keep on getting more lucrative. This also not only contributes to getting a greater number of nodes running on the network, but it also helps with the network effect of the platform, an important aspect that tremendously helps to spread the word around in an organic manner.</p><h2 id=\"high-listing-fees-vs-low-listing-fees\">High Listing Fees vs Low Listing Fees</h2><p>Before you go ahead and adjust how you would like listing fees to be, it is important to understand the impact behind lowering or increasing them. Some arguments can be made from both sides, and it is important to be aware of both perspectives to make the best-informed decision possible.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/image-7.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/image-7.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/12/image-7.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/image-7.png 1314w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h3 id=\"lower-fees\">Lower fees</h3><ul><li>Easier to onboard large scale vendors and lowers the barrier to entry</li><li>Makes the financial cost of spamming the network smaller</li><li>Makes the financial cost of not maintaining a listing smaller</li><li>Smaller increase in staking rewards per listing posted</li></ul><h3 id=\"higher-fees\">Higher fees</h3><ul><li>More costly for large scale vendors to post their inventory on the marketplace and higher barrier to entry</li><li>Makes the financial cost of spamming the network greater</li><li>Makes the financial cost of not maintaining a listing greater</li><li>Bigger increase in staking rewards per listing posted</li></ul><p>It’s important to note, though, that lower fees don’t necessarily mean smaller staking rewards for stakers. It does make a smaller increase on staking rewards <strong>per listing published</strong>, but lower fees enable larger sellers to set up shop on the marketplace and post large inventories, potentially leading to more individual listings on the marketplace, leading to bigger staking rewards.</p><h2 id=\"tutorial-how-to-adjust-listing-fees\">Tutorial — How to Adjust Listing Fees</h2><p>So you now have a pretty good idea of how you’d like listing fees to cost but don’t know how to make it happen. You find yourself in the right place! In fact, since Particl Core 0.18.0.10, it has been possible for stakers to broadcast their target listing fee to the network.</p><h3 id=\"a-community-powered-tug-of-war\">A Community-Powered Tug-of-War</h3><p>One staker obviously cannot single-handedly modify listing fees to whatever he wants them to be. That’s because this value is attained through community consensus.</p><p>Listing fees on Particl are updated every 5,040 blocks, or roughly every week (10,080 minutes). This is done according to the consensus established by stakers. In between those listing fee updates, the network’s consensus is in a constant state of fee discovery. A target listing fee value (identified by the smsgfeeratetarget parameter) is dynamically adjusted each time a block is staked. Every 5,040 blocks, the fee is adjusted based on the average of all fee targets broadcast by stakers. </p><p>The smsgfeeratetarget can only increase or decrease in small increments. Then, once the 5,040th block is reached, the network looks up at the current smsgfeeratetarget value and makes it its base listing fee until the next 5,040th block.</p><p><strong>This can be seen as a giant game of digital tug-of-war</strong>. Each staker broadcasts to the network what kind of listing fees it wants to see on the marketplace (higher or lower fees?). Then, the smsgfeeratetarget value either trends upwards or downwards depending on where the consensus lies. If the majority of stakers want fees to remain the same, then that consensus won’t move by a whole lot. If the majority wants to lower the fees by just a little, the smsgfeeratetarget will slowly trend lower, in small increments. If the majority of stakers want dramatically lower listing fees, then smsgfeeratetarget will trend lower at a much faster pace. In other words, the more people pull the metaphorical rope to their side, the faster the network’s going to adjust its fees. It is just like a digital game of tug-of-war.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Note (01-12-2021):</em></strong><em> The listing fee adjusting feature will be updated and improved in the next hardfork coming in early 2022. While you can adjust the fee target at this moment, doing so might result only in negligible changes.</em></blockquote><p>The fact that smsgfeeratetarget can only trend upwards or downwards in small increments enhances the stability of fees on the marketplace and makes the process of establishing consensus smoother and less bumpy (less dramatic and unpredictable changes).</p><h4 id=\"put-the-current-value-into-perspective\">Put the current value into perspective</h4><p>To get a better understanding of the listing's fee impact we need to put the current market price for PART and the use-case of 100 listings per month into perspective.</p><p>Note: The listing_size is an assumptive averaged number and consists of 2-3 images per item and 1000 chars of text.</p><pre><code># Calculations basis\n\nPART_price = $1.00\nfee_rate = 0.00004762\nlisting_size = 500KB\nlisting_days = 30\nlisting_items = 100\n\n# Formula\n\n((((listing_size x fee_rate) * PART_price) * listing days) * listing_items)\n\n((((500 x 0.00004762) * 1.00) * 30) * 100) = $71.43\n\n# Calculations\n\nPART RATE PER DAY \n500x0.00004762 = 0,02381\n\nUSD RATE PER DAY \n0.02381 x 1 = 0.02381\n\nUSD RATE PER MONTH \n0.02381 x 30 = 0.7143\n\nUSD RATE PER MONTH for 100 ITEMS \n0.7143 x 100 = $71.43</code></pre><p>In the example above, a vendor would need to spend $71.43 per month for 100 listings. But, of course, no final value fee or any other fees apply to a sale with Particl Marketplace.</p><p>Now, we must keep in mind the idea of this listing fee is to fight off spam. So, ideally, the lowest number possible gets signaled by the community and should get increased if it seems needed to fight off spam. This is where your help is needed.</p><h2 id=\"broadcast-a-different-listing-fee-target\">Broadcast a Different Listing Fee Target</h2><p>The way to broadcast your desired smsgfeeratetarget value depends on how you're currently staking your coins. To broadcast your target, you need to do two things:</p><ul><li>Take note of the current value of smsgfeeratetarget</li><li>Broadcast your desired target to the network</li></ul><h3 id=\"if-you-re-staking-on-either-particl-desktop-or-particl-qt\">If You’re Staking on Either Particl Desktop or Particl-Qt</h3><p>If you are not cold staking your coins and only keeping a Particl wallet “unlocked for staking only”, then adjusting your smsgfeeratetarget parameter is pretty simple. To do so, you first need to know the current value of smsgfeeratetarget so that you can figure out your desired target. </p><p>To do so, simply open up the &lt;console&gt; and enter the <code>smsggetfeerate</code> command.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/image.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/12/image.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/12/image.png 1269w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Typing this command will return the current value of smsgfeeratetarget in the console window. This is the current base value being used by the marketplace to establish listing fees. In the example illustrated above, this command returns the value <code>23255</code>. This means the current value of smsgfeerate is 0.00023255. This is important to know as it will tell you what value you want to broadcast depending on your preference.</p><p>Now you need to broadcast to the network your desired target. To do it, type the following command in the console by replacing 0.00000001 with whatever target you want to set.</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">walletsettings stakingoptions {\"smsgfeeratetarget\":0.00000001}</code></pre><p>For example, if you would like fees to be 10x lower than 0.00023255, then you would put the value at 0.00002325. If you want to reduce fees by 100x, then simply put the value at 0.00000232. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001. <strong>Note that your desired value has to be 8 decimals or less.</strong></p><blockquote><strong>Important:</strong> If you already have a custom <em>stakingoptions</em> parameter, like a custom <em>rewardaddress</em>, for example, then please enter the following command into the &lt;console&gt; and replace <em>addr</em> by the <em>rewardaddress</em> you set up previously: </blockquote><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">walletsettings stakingoptions {\"rewardaddress\": \"addr\",\"smsgfeeratetarget\":0.00000001}</code></pre><h3 id=\"if-you-re-cold-staking-coins-on-a-staking-node\">If You’re Cold Staking Coins on a Staking Node</h3><p>If you cold staking your coins on a staking node you control, then you will need to broadcast your listing fee target from the staking node itself. </p><p>To do so, you first need to know the current value of smsgfeeratetarget so that you can figure out your desired target. To do so, simply open up the console and enter the following command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">./particlcore/particl-cli smsggetfeerate</code></pre><p>Typing this command will return the current value of smsgfeeratetarget in the terminal. This is the current base value being used by the marketplace to establish listing fees. </p><p>At the time of writing this blog post, this command returned the value 23255. This means the current value of smsgfeerate is 0.00023255. This is important to know as it will tell you what value you want to broadcast depending on your preference. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001.</p><p>Now you need to broadcast to the network your desired target. To do it, first update your partyman application to make sure you are on the latest version:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">cd partyman &amp;&amp; git pull</code></pre><p> Then, open up the smsgfeeratetarget menu by typing this command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">./partyman stakingnode smsgfeeratetarget</code></pre><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Adjusting-Listing-Fees/1-OLpQIvxuczEzoa_flsWpfw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>This command will first give you the current value of smsgfeeratetarget that your node broadcasts. It'll then ask you whether you would like to configure a new target or not. If you wish to do so, type <code>y</code> to move forward through the process. </p><p>Once that is done, the partyman application will prompt you to type in your desired target. Simply write the target you want to broadcast. For example, if you would like fees to be 10x lower than 0.00023255, then you would put the value at 0.00002325. If you want to reduce fees by 100x, then simply put the value at 0.00000232. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001. Once you’ve chosen and written your new target, press <code>Enter</code> to apply the change and start broadcasting it to the network. <strong>Note that your desired value has to be 8 decimals or less.</strong></p><h3 id=\"if-you-re-staking-on-a-cold-staking-pool\">If You’re Staking on a Cold Staking Pool</h3><p>If you’re staking your coins on a staking pool, then you cannot broadcast your desired target. You will need to either stake your coins on your own staking node or find a staking pool that broadcasts a target that’s close to your liking.</p><h3 id=\"if-you-re-operating-a-cold-staking-pool\">If You’re Operating a Cold Staking Pool</h3><p>If you are the operator of a cold staking pool and want to broadcast a different target, then simply follow the instructions available on Github by following <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool/blob/master/doc/set_an_smsg_feerate_target.md\">this link</a></strong>.</p><h3 id=\"if-you-re-not-staking\">If You’re Not Staking</h3><p>If you’re not staking your coins, then you cannot broadcast your target to the network. This is a golden opportunity for you to get started with staking and be part of Particl’s fully decentralized consensus-finding process. If you want to get started with cold staking, simply follow the steps available in <strong><a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/guides/guide_mp_general_enable_staking.html\">this Particl Academy tutorial</a></strong>.</p><hr><p>Now you’re all set to start broadcasting your listing fee target rate to the network. Take note that, at this time, the fee adjusting feature is not optimal and may result in negligible changes only.

It does make a smaller increase on staking rewards <strong>per listing published</strong>, but lower fees enable larger sellers to set up shop on the marketplace and post large inventories, potentially leading to more individual listings on the marketplace, leading to bigger staking rewards.</p><h2 id=\"tutorial-how-to-adjust-listing-fees\">Tutorial — How to Adjust Listing Fees</h2><p>So you now have a pretty good idea of how you’d like listing fees to cost but don’t know how to make it happen. You find yourself in the right place! In fact, since Particl Core 0.18.0.10, it has been possible for stakers to broadcast their target listing fee to the network.</p><h3 id=\"a-community-powered-tug-of-war\">A Community-Powered Tug-of-War</h3><p>One staker obviously cannot single-handedly modify listing fees to whatever he wants them to be. That’s because this value is attained through community consensus.</p><p>Listing fees on Particl are updated every 5,040 blocks, or roughly every week (10,080 minutes). This is done according to the consensus established by stakers. In between those listing fee updates, the network’s consensus is in a constant state of fee discovery. A target listing fee value (identified by the smsgfeeratetarget parameter) is dynamically adjusted each time a block is staked. Every 5,040 blocks, the fee is adjusted based on the average of all fee targets broadcast by stakers. </p><p>The smsgfeeratetarget can only increase or decrease in small increments. Then, once the 5,040th block is reached, the network looks up at the current smsgfeeratetarget value and makes it its base listing fee until the next 5,040th block.</p><p><strong>This can be seen as a giant game of digital tug-of-war</strong>. Each staker broadcasts to the network what kind of listing fees it wants to see on the marketplace (higher or lower fees?). Then, the smsgfeeratetarget value either trends upwards or downwards depending on where the consensus lies. If the majority of stakers want fees to remain the same, then that consensus won’t move by a whole lot. If the majority wants to lower the fees by just a little, the smsgfeeratetarget will slowly trend lower, in small increments. If the majority of stakers want dramatically lower listing fees, then smsgfeeratetarget will trend lower at a much faster pace. In other words, the more people pull the metaphorical rope to their side, the faster the network’s going to adjust its fees. It is just like a digital game of tug-of-war.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Note (01-12-2021):</em></strong><em> The listing fee adjusting feature will be updated and improved in the next hardfork coming in early 2022. While you can adjust the fee target at this moment, doing so might result only in negligible changes.</em></blockquote><p>The fact that smsgfeeratetarget can only trend upwards or downwards in small increments enhances the stability of fees on the marketplace and makes the process of establishing consensus smoother and less bumpy (less dramatic and unpredictable changes).</p><h4 id=\"put-the-current-value-into-perspective\">Put the current value into perspective</h4><p>To get a better understanding of the listing's fee impact we need to put the current market price for PART and the use-case of 100 listings per month into perspective.</p><p>Note: The listing_size is an assumptive averaged number and consists of 2-3 images per item and 1000 chars of text.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-code-card gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\"># Calculations basis\n\nPART_price = $1.00\nfee_rate = 0.00004762\nlisting_size = 500KB\nlisting_days = 30\nlisting_items = 100\n\n# Formula\n\n((((listing_size x fee_rate) * PART_price) * listing days) * listing_items)\n\n((((500 x 0.00004762) * 1.00) * 30) * 100) = $71.43\n\n# Calculations\n\nPART RATE PER DAY \n500x0.00004762 = 0,02381\n\nUSD RATE PER DAY \n0.02381 x 1 = 0.02381\n\nUSD RATE PER MONTH \n0.02381 x 30 = 0.7143\n\nUSD RATE PER MONTH for 100 ITEMS \n0.7143 x 100 = $71.43</code></pre></div><p>In the example above, a vendor would need to spend $71.43 per month for 100 listings. But, of course, no final value fee or any other fees apply to a sale with Particl Marketplace.</p><p>Now, we must keep in mind the idea of this listing fee is to fight off spam. So, ideally, the lowest number possible gets signaled by the community and should get increased if it seems needed to fight off spam. This is where your help is needed.</p><h2 id=\"broadcast-a-different-listing-fee-target\">Broadcast a Different Listing Fee Target</h2><p>The way to broadcast your desired smsgfeeratetarget value depends on how you're currently staking your coins. To broadcast your target, you need to do two things:</p><ul><li>Take note of the current value of smsgfeeratetarget</li><li>Broadcast your desired target to the network</li></ul><h3 id=\"if-you-re-staking-on-either-particl-desktop-or-particl-qt\">If You’re Staking on Either Particl Desktop or Particl-Qt</h3><p>If you are not cold staking your coins and only keeping a Particl wallet “unlocked for staking only”, then adjusting your smsgfeeratetarget parameter is pretty simple. To do so, you first need to know the current value of smsgfeeratetarget so that you can figure out your desired target. </p><p>To do so, simply open up the &#x3C;console> and enter the <code class=\"language-text\">smsggetfeerate</code> command.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/2021/12/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2021/12/image.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2021/12/image.png 1000w, /glink/2021/12/image.png 1269w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Typing this command will return the current value of smsgfeeratetarget in the console window. This is the current base value being used by the marketplace to establish listing fees. In the example illustrated above, this command returns the value <code class=\"language-text\">23255</code>. This means the current value of smsgfeerate is 0.00023255. This is important to know as it will tell you what value you want to broadcast depending on your preference.</p><p>Now you need to broadcast to the network your desired target. To do it, type the following command in the console by replacing 0.00000001 with whatever target you want to set.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-code-card gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">walletsettings stakingoptions <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token string\">\"smsgfeeratetarget\"</span>:0.00000001<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div><p>For example, if you would like fees to be 10x lower than 0.00023255, then you would put the value at 0.00002325.

To do so, simply open up the console and enter the following command:</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-code-card gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">./particlcore/particl-cli smsggetfeerate</code></pre></div><p>Typing this command will return the current value of smsgfeeratetarget in the terminal.

The lowest possible number is 0.00000001.</p><p>Now you need to broadcast to the network your desired target.

It'll then ask you whether you would like to configure a new target or not. If you wish to do so, type <code class=\"language-text\">y</code> to move forward through the process. </p><p>Once that is done, the partyman application will prompt you to type in your desired target. Simply write the target you want to broadcast. For example, if you would like fees to be 10x lower than 0.00023255, then you would put the value at 0.00002325. If you want to reduce fees by 100x, then simply put the value at 0.00000232. The lowest possible number is 0.00000001.

It lets you make or take orders on a distributed\norder book and execute swaps that are safe, trustless, unrestricted, and\nprivate. To find out what makes it a one-of-a-kind DEX, keep on reading this\nblog post!\n\nMockup of BasicSwap's UI | Work-in-progress that is subject to changeParticl’s\nupcoming DEX is powered by the atomic swap technology\n[https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/08/20/a-beginners-guide-to-atomic-swaps/] \nand the SMSG network\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_mp_explained.html#the-securemessaging-smsg-protocol]\n, making it entirely decentralized and devoid of any central operator. No KYC,\nno trickery, no false promises. Just pure decentralization and privacy. And yes,\nin case you were wondering, it is fully compatible with Monero (XMR) and will be\nright from the get-go! ?\n\nIn this blog post, we will take a deep look into this new Particl distributed\napplication. We’ll detail how it’s going to fit in as a critical component of\nthe Particl ecosystem and, perhaps even more importantly, ensure the personal\nfreedom and financial sovereignty of its users.\n\nTable of Contents\n * The Particl Ecosystem Explained\n * The BasicSwap DEX Explained\n * List of Compatible Coins\n * Key Features\n * Monetization\n * How Does it Compare?\n * Why is BasicSwap Sorely Needed?\n * Open Beta Coming Soon\n\nThe Particl Ecosystem Explained\nThe first step to understanding the significance of BasicSwap’s upcoming release\nfor Particl is to get a good grasp of what the Particl ecosystem is.\n\nParticl Marketplace, accessible through Particl DesktopParticl is an ecosystem\nthat gives you the ability to live completely free by cutting off middlemen\nentirely. It’s a platform that hosts different apps that respect your rights,\nfreedoms, and privacy without any compromise. While it’s still under heavy\ndevelopment, Particl aspires to become an all-inclusive and circular economy\nthat people can use to opt-out of the current global financial system. In other\nwords, it’s all about personal freedom and financial sovereignty.\n\nIn many ways, the ultimate vision of the platform can be compared as a sort of\n“decentralized and private WeChat-like ecosystem” where you can get all the key\nservices or products you need right at your fingertips. Alternatively, you can\nalso see it as an OS-like platform for distributed apps. In any case, Particl is\nan ecosystem of distributed apps, or “dapps”, where independence from any\nthird-party or service provider is absolute. And BasicSwap is an incredibly\nimportant step towards that vision.\n\nIn fact, as the Particl ecosystem enables you to become truly financially\nindependent, it’s easy to understand how an equally independent, resilient, and\nunstoppable way to buy and sell the platform’s native currency (PART) is\nrequired. However, at the time of this writing, PART is only available through\ncentralized exchanges or by unprotected OTC deals between two people. While\ncentralized exchanges (i.e., Bittrex\n[https://global.bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-PART], WizardSwap\n[https://wizardswap.io/]) can provide many benefits and unique features, not\nhaving any decentralized option is not an option for a platform that seeks to be\nuncompromisingly independent. But that’s all about to change!\n\nNow let’s dive deeper into BasicSwap and let’s see how it’s going to become a\ncornerstone for the entire Particl ecosystem. We'll also detail how it will\nbecome a competitive and vibrant trading platform for all cryptocurrencies that\nend up on it.\n\nThe BasicSwap DEX Explained\nKeeping in mind that the Particl ecosystem is your gateway into a completely\nindependent and autonomous economy, it’s vital to be able to acquire (and sell\nor trade) the platform’s native currency in an equally independent, safe, fast,\nand decentralized way. That’s precisely what the BasicSwap DEX enables you to\ndo, but it doesn’t stop at just buying and selling PART.\n\nMockup of BasicSwap's UI | Work-in-progress that is subject to changeBasicSwap\nis a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol. It lets you swap one cryptocurrency\nfor another from a different chain (cross-chain). It’s also private by nature. \n\nSwaps are made directly person-to-person, without any intermediary, using a\ndistributed order book. Every single aspect of the BasicSwap protocol is\ndecentralized and open-source, so you don’t have to take our word for it; you\ncan check the code yourself!\n\nList of Compatible Coins\n * Bitcoin\n * Monero\n * Particl\n * Litecoin\n * Namecoin\n\nWe are looking at adding various coins, including ETH and its ERC-20 tokens,\nshortly after the release of the Open Beta. Any Bitcoin-based and Segwit enabled\ncryptocurrency can get integrated with minimal effort. Other token issuing\nblockchains like Fantom, Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, or Binance Smart Chain may\nbecome available on BasicSwap as well, at a later stage of the integration\nroadmap.\n\nKey Features\nBasicSwap is a one-of-its-kind DEX in the blockchain industry. While it offers\nmany benefits against centralized exchanges, it has three main distinguishing\nfeatures that set it apart from other decentralized exchanges.\n\nDistributed Order Books\nBasicSwap’s first version will focus on trading with an order book. Instead of\nswapping your coins into a liquidity pool (like on Uniswap, SushiSwap, or\nPancakeSwap), you can either place an order on the distributed order book\n(maker), at the price that you want, or take an order that has already been\nplaced on there by other swappers (taker). In many ways, this makes BasicSwap\nmore akin to the typical centralized exchanges most people are used to trading\non, but with a totally decentralized and private twist.\n\nNote that, unlike the vast majority of DEXs that offer order books, BasicSwap’s\norder book system is truly distributed and doesn’t introduce any form of\ncentralization. No funny business here; BasicSwap makes it truly impossible, by\ndesign, for any third-party to have uncalled influence on the platform, and\nthat's provably verifiable through code! The order book is powered by Particl’s\nown P2P network, SMSG network\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_mp_explained.html#the-securemessaging-smsg-protocol]\n, which is the same network that powers Particl Marketplace\n[https://particl.io/marketplace].\n\nThe main benefit of having an order book system is that you can swap coins at\nthe exact price that you want to swap them for. It also attracts more\ntraditional market makers who may not want to provide liquidity to\nsmart-contract based liquidity pools due to the risks of rug pulls\n[https://learn.bybit.com/investing/why-crypto-rug-pulls-happen-in-defi/] and\nother theoretical exploits they carry.\n\nBut there’s more coming to BasicSwap! You can expect “quick swaps” to be\ndeployed at some point in the future. As a matter of fact, this is already being\nlooked into at the time of this writing! We will let you know more about it as\nsoon (™) as we can!\n\nTrue Cross-Chain Swaps\nParticl’s upcoming DEXs is a true cross-chain trading exchange. Unlike other\nDEX, BasicSwap does not mimic cross-chain interoperability. You’ll exchange one\nnative coin for another one without any unsafe trickery!\n\nYou can swap one coin (i.e., Bitcoin) for one from another blockchain (i.e.,\nMonero). And no, we’re not just talking about swapping coins between different\nEthereum forks here (i.e., ETH to BSC). Moreover, BasicSwap doesn’t require\ncoins to be wrapped into tokens of another chain (often Ethereum, Binance Smart\nChain, or other similar chains).\n\nThe World’s Most Private Trading Exchange\nTo top it off, BasicSwap is inherently private. But what does that mean?! Well,\nit means a few things. For one, you won’t need to create an account, send\ndocuments, verify yourself, or limit your trading activities to arbitrary\nmaximum daily restrictions. It’s open to all, without any restriction, and\nwithout any care about who you are or where you live.\n\nThat’s already a major improvement over centralized exchanges that have become\nway too curious, but you can take things even further! You can indeed massively\nincrease your level of privacy by swapping any cryptocurrency for privacy coins\nlike Particl or Monero, or by using them as a gateway to add a layer of privacy\nbetween two \"public coins\" (i.e,. Bitcoin and Litecoin). \n\nIndeed, all Monero transactions are inherently private, and BasicSwap lets you\nswap PART using any of its privacy states; public, blind (\nConfidentialTransactions\n[https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation]),\nor anon (RingCT\n[https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf]\n). We’re planning on eventually enabling more private swap options through other\nprivacy coins as well (i.e., Firo, Veil, etc).\n\nBut there is STILL more to come in regards to privacy! As we move forward and\ndeploy the Taproot protocol on Particl, you can expect swaps of Bitcoin-style\ncurrencies to become indistinguishable from regular transactions. In other\nwords, it will be eventually near-impossible to tell that, for example, a\nBitcoin to Particl swap has occurred just by looking at their respective\nblockchains. That’s a major win for your financial privacy!\n\nIndeed, enabling Taproot support is planned for a later stage of the Open Beta.\nThat's one of the reasons why Particl's blockchain is always kept up-to-date\nwith Bitcoin’s latest releases. It brings battle-hardened and reliable\nfunctionalities for your day-to-day financial sovereignty!\n\nThe combination of all these privacy-related features will make BasicSwap the\nworld’s most private and unrestricted trading exchange, and that, in turn, will\nmake you completely financially independent. Claim your sovereignty and live\nfree...because, well, now you can!\n\nOther Interesting Features\nThere are a couple of other features that you may find interesting. As BasicSwap\nwill become an important development focus moving forward, this list is expected\nto grow gradually.\n\n * True Monero support\n * No account, sign up, or KYC\n * Incredibly low and competitive fees\n * User-friendly interface\n * No third-party, intermediary, or middleman at any point\n * Taproot compatible\n * Lightning Network compatible (in later versions)\n\nWhat About Monetization?\nAs BasicSwap is entirely decentralized, no single party can earn profits from\nswaps made on the platform. That’d be very...centralized! But rest assured, we\nabsolutely intend on turning Particl’s upcoming DEX into the spark that will\ncause the Particl project to go viral. Indeed, we are strongly confident that\nthe DEX was the missing piece all along.\n\nIndeed, it’s likely that a very small and competitive fee will be charged for\nusing the DEX. But instead of having a third-party collecting them, it’s the\nentire Particl community who will benefit from them. All fees paid for using the\nDEX will be either converted into PART and burned, redistributed to stakers, or\nused as a liquidity incentive. A combination of these three strategies is likely\nto be what’s going to be deployed, although we haven’t finalized the strategy\njust yet and are still experimenting with different approaches.\n\nIn other words, we are working towards building BasicSwap in such a way that, as\nmore people swap coins on the platform, the more demand there will be for the\nPART coin, the less available supply there will be, and the more valuable your\nstaking rewards will be. And that’s just one application out of many others on\nthe Particl ecosystem (Particl Marketplace has a similar dynamic as well).\n\nKeep in mind that we want BasicSwap to provide an experience that has as little\nfriction as possible. We also want any fee charged to remain very competitive\nwith industry standards and, obviously, legally viable.\n\nHow Does it Compare\nWe know we know, there are many exchanges around, both centralized and\ndecentralized. But we’re very confident that BasicSwap stands on its own and\noffers something quite unique.\n\nIn the interest of making it clear how BasicSwap differentiates itself from\nother trading platforms, here’s a brief breakdown of the differences with some\nof the other solutions around.\n\nBittrex, Binance, Coinbase, etc.  Compared to centralized exchanges... \n\nYou control your keys at any point in time You don't have to create an account\nor submit any document You don't need to verify yourself (KYC) There's no upper\nlimit as to how much you can trade per period of time You remain private every\nstep of the way There's no third-party, middleman, or intermediary involved at\nall \n\nUniswap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, etc.  Compared to “quick swap” exchanges with liquidity pools… \n\nYou can place or take orders on a distributed order book You swap your coins at\nthe exact price that you want Swaps are truly cross-chain; no wrapped token\nrequired (i.e., wBTC) Providing liquidity is done in a more traditional way\nusing order books (as opposed to liquidity pools) There's no rug to pull (read\nmore about the infamous rug pulls here\n[https://learn.bybit.com/investing/why-crypto-rug-pulls-happen-in-defi/]) \n\nBISQ  Compared to the BISQ exchange... \n\nThe process of swapping is entirely decentralized and done between two people No\nsecurity deposit or escrow intermediary required Fees are lower Swaps are atomic\nby nature, you can’t be scammed or tricked by bad actors \n\nCOMIT  Compared to the COMIT network... \n\nYou can place or take orders on a distributed order book You swap your coins at\nthe exact price that you want You can swap a vast selection of cryptocurrencies;\nit’s not exclusively Monero-centric Uses the SMSG network to safely execute\nswaps All options and steps are available from a user interface \n\nWhy is BasicSwap Sorely Needed?\nUtility Impact on Particl\nThe most obvious reason for BasicSwap to be is to provide the Particl ecosystem\nwith an independent, autonomous, and private way to swap, buy, and sell the\nnative currency of the platform (PART) for as many other cryptocurrencies as\npossible.\n\nEarly mockup of a BasicSwap integration into Particl Desktop | Work-in-progress\nthat is subject to changeRelying on centralized exchanges and partners can\nprovide useful solutions and avenues to trade PART, but it makes the entire\necosystem dependent on them which is an unbearable risk. With BasicSwap, Particl\nbecomes resilient against any exchange delisting and ensures the longevity of\nthe project no matter what gets thrown at it. In other words, it makes Particl\npermanently unstoppable!\n\nPromoting and Supporting Financial Sovereignty\nAt this time, with all of the promises and potential that cryptocurrencies\nyield, speculation is still their number one use case. Every day, billions upon\nbillions worth of dollars in cryptocurrencies are traded on exchanges, both\ncentralized and decentralized.\n\nFurthermore, with the looming aggressive regulations that certain countries wish\nto impose on crypto, especially towards coins that protect your private life,\ncentralized exchanges have been more and more restrictive while asking for more\nand more information about you and your funds. This locks several people out of\ntrading cryptocurrencies in a practical matter and this problem is expected to\naccentuate as we move forward. Keep in mind, this is far from being a\nParticl-centric issue, but rather an industry-wide issue that’s impacting\nthousands if not millions of users, daily.\n\nWith this in mind, BasicSwap is a beacon of light in an environment that grows\ndarker by the day for those who care about their financial sovereignty. By\ngiving anyone the ability to easily swap cryptocurrencies from one chain to\nanother, without any sort of restriction or overreaching requirements, it allows\npeople to remain independent and keep their financial details to themselves.\n\nAs a matter of fact, never ever will BasicSwap ask you for any information or\nrestrict you from using its services based on arbitrary rules such as who you\nare, where you live, or what your transaction history may look like; it’s\nentirely decentralized, autonomous, and open to all! This, alone, is bound to\nattract freedom lovers, giving the Particl project much deserved attention from\nthis audience.\n\nExposure for the Project\nBecause of how the Particl ecosystem and its distributed apps are all\ninterconnected, we expect a non-negligible portion of BasicSwap users to start\nusing other Particl apps and become Particl-wide users. That’s likely to\naccentuate much more as soon as the DEX gets integrated into Particl Desktop.\nAfter all, there’s much more to trading crypto, you’ve got to spend your gains\nas well! And, lo and behold, that’s precisely what Particl Marketplace lets you\ndo (and you STILL stay completely private when doing so).\n\nFor this reason, BasicSwap is eventually going to become a major focus in terms\nof communications, marketing, PR, and outreach efforts, on the same level and as\na complement to the marketplace.\n\nThat being said, the upcoming release of BasicSwap is a golden opportunity for\nParticl to become viral and become successful. Remember, billions upon billions\nworth of cryptocurrencies are traded every day, and BasicSwap’s unique set of\nfeatures is bound to capture even just a tiny fraction of that pie.\n\nIndeed, as the main use-case for cryptocurrencies is currently speculation,\nreleasing a highly functional and one-of-a-kind cross-chain and private DEX is a\nmajor bid in that direction. We highly encourage you all to help us spread the\ngood word about it to kick start its adoption. For all of us in the community,\nit’s sure going to bring a breath of fresh air to be able to market a new\nproduct other than the marketplace!\n\nEasier User Onboarding for Particl Marketplace\nAll payments on Particl Marketplace [https://particl.io/marketplace] are\nprivate. That's why you need to hold some PART coins in your \"anon balance\" to\nuse it. The anon balance is where the coins that you own that are in the RingCT\nprivacy state (click here to learn more\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_part_coin.html#privacy-specifications]\n) are located.\n\nAnd because all current PART exchanges (i.e., Bittrex, Probit, WizardSwap, etc.)\nwork using public balances only, getting started with the marketplace requires\nnew users to go through a few additional, manual steps to transfer coins from\ntheir public balance to the anon one. This has often been reported as a\nsignificant challenge to the marketplace's adoption, and BasicSwap provides a\nsimple solution to that problem.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, BasicSwap lets you swap PART using the balance type of\nyour choice. You can swap it against almost any other cryptocurrency, for\nexample, Bitcoin, and use either your public, blind, or anon (marketplace-ready)\nbalances to send or receive the PART. If you choose to swap the Bitcoin for PART\nusing your anon balance, then as soon as the swap completes, you'll be ready to\nuse the marketplace right away!\n\nIncreasing Demand for PART, Decreasing Supply, and Growing Staking Rewards\nAs you now know, we are looking into several monetization mechanisms to benefit\nthe entire Particl ecosystem for the success of BasicSwap. Mind you, nothing is\nset in stone yet, but this includes mechanisms that would increase the demand\nfor PART, reduce its circulating supply (burning coins), and introduce\nincentives for providing liquidity.\n\nOf course, it’s very important to keep the costs of using the DEX as low as\npossible so that it remains competitive with other solutions. It’s also\nimportant to keep it as frictionless as possible because the easier it is to\nuse, the more people will use it. We'll communicate to the community what\nmonetization strategies will be deployed as early as we can!\n\nWhen is the Open Beta Going Live?\nCurrently, BasicSwap is in closed beta and has been in a testing phase for\nseveral months now. An Open Beta, on mainnet and open to the public, is now just\nabout to launch. While we cannot yet give an estimate on its launch date, we\nexpect it to go live before the end of the year 2021 as a nice end-of-year\npresent to the community. Keep in mind, that is not guaranteed and should not be\nconsidered any sort of official estimate; this is however what we’re hoping for.\n\nWhat to Expect From the Open Beta?\nBy any means, the Open Beta is not intended to be a finished product and will\nstill very much be a beta product in beta phase. As such, you can expect a rough\nexperience that isn’t all that much focused on user-friendliness. As its name\nimplies, the “Open Beta” is intended to beta test the core features of the DEX\nand to ensure that the back-end works safely and as expected over a vast\nselection of environments and situations.\n\nHere are a few notes of what you can expect from the upcoming Open Beta phase.\n\n * Full mainnet functionality with swaps working with real coins\n * Compatibility with Bitcoin, Monero, Litecoin, Namecoin, and Particl. More\n   coins will be added incrementally, especially around the time of the full\n   release. We are already in touch with a few projects for integrations; the\n   number of coins available on the DEX may grow rapidly once that becomes a\n   bigger focus.\n * You will need to manually build the client following a set of instructions.\n   There won’t be executables or one-click options to get started just yet, but\n   rest assured that we have great solutions in the pipeline to simplify\n   onboarding as much as possible.\n * A basic, barebone, and temporary user interface. The Open Beta won’t use, at\n   least not to start with, any of the standalone or Particl Desktop mockups\n   that we’ve shared in the past just yet. The Open Beta is for testers to test\n   the back-end and technical features and is generally recommended for the more\n   advanced types of users.\n * You will need to sync the blockchain of most of the coins you want to swap\n   (excluding Monero, which you can simply sync to a public node). We plan on\n   taking that requirement away in future versions of BasicSwap.\n * As with any beta software, you might encounter bugs or weird behaviors. Don’t\n   worry, that’s why we’re doing an extensive Beta phase! So far, we are happy\n   to confirm that, due to the safe and fail-proof nature of atomic swaps, we\n   (including the closed beta group of testers) haven’t encountered any swap\n   that failed and resulted in the loss of coins. Still, do keep in mind that\n   it’s better to be safe than sorry and to ideally trade small amounts rather\n   than large ones. It’s still early technology after all!\n\nOf course, that is not all. We have many surprises in the works which we intend\non revealing soon (™). We are likely to add surprise features throughout the\nlifecycle of this Open Beta phase, so as we often say; stay tuned!\n\nWhat’s Left to do Before the Open Beta Goes Live?\nAs we rapidly near the release of the Open Beta, we’re checking off the last few\nitems that remain on the to-do list. In reality, there isn’t much left to do as\nan insane amount of work has been silently going towards BasicSwap for several\nmonths now. Here are the last items needed to be completed before the Open Beta\nrelease.\n\n * More testing and optimizations, notably related to the building and\n   installation process.\n * Finish up the temporary UI for the Open Beta so that it’s easier to test.\n * Catching and fixing edge-case issues and other minor bugs.\n\nOnce these items are completed, we’ll be ready to release the BasicSwap Open\nBeta to the public. We’ll clearly communicate, as soon as we can, when it will\ngo live.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs we’ve hopefully made clear by now, we have big plans for BasicSwap and\nstrongly believe it can make Particl go viral and speed up the adoption and\nsuccess of the entire Particl platform. Perhaps more importantly, it is a major\nplay towards preserving everyone’s freedom and financial sovereignty. The\nbenefits BasicSwap opens up to the cryptocurrency industry go much, much further\nthan simply being helpful for the Particl community.\n\nAs such, we have a lot more planned than what we’ve mentioned in this blog post,\nbut we obviously don’t want to play all of our cards yet. After all, the\ninfamous “soon (™)” motto has to live on! ?\n\nSo, most definitely keep a keen eye on Particl News and look out for any update\neither in blog posts dedicated to BasicSwap or in our weekly development\nprogress reports. You’re bound to be mesmerized!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

We'll also detail how it will become a competitive and vibrant trading platform for all cryptocurrencies that end up on it.</p><h2 id=\"the-basicswap-dex-explained\">The BasicSwap DEX Explained</h2><p>Keeping in mind that the Particl ecosystem is your gateway into a completely independent and autonomous economy, it’s vital to be able to acquire (and sell or trade) the platform’s native currency in an equally independent, safe, fast, and decentralized way. That’s precisely what the BasicSwap DEX enables you to do, but it doesn’t stop at just buying and selling PART.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 1823w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption>Mockup of BasicSwap's UI | Work-in-progress that is subject to change</figcaption></figure><p>BasicSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol. It lets you swap one cryptocurrency for another from a different chain (cross-chain). It’s also private by nature. </p><p>Swaps are made directly person-to-person, without any intermediary, using a distributed order book. Every single aspect of the BasicSwap protocol is decentralized and open-source, so you don’t have to take our word for it; you can check the code yourself!</p><h2 id=\"list-of-compatible-coins\">List of Compatible Coins</h2><ul><li>Bitcoin</li><li>Monero</li><li>Particl</li><li>Litecoin</li><li>Namecoin</li></ul><p>We are looking at adding various coins, including ETH and its ERC-20 tokens, shortly after the release of the Open Beta. Any Bitcoin-based and Segwit enabled cryptocurrency can get integrated with minimal effort. Other token issuing blockchains like Fantom, Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, or Binance Smart Chain may become available on BasicSwap as well, at a later stage of the integration roadmap.</p><h2 id=\"key-features\">Key Features</h2><p>BasicSwap is a one-of-its-kind DEX in the blockchain industry. While it offers many benefits against centralized exchanges, it has three main distinguishing features that set it apart from other decentralized exchanges.</p><h3 id=\"distributed-order-books\">Distributed Order Books</h3><p>BasicSwap’s first version will focus on trading with an order book. Instead of swapping your coins into a liquidity pool (like on Uniswap, SushiSwap, or PancakeSwap), you can either place an order on the distributed order book (maker), at the price that you want, or take an order that has already been placed on there by other swappers (taker). In many ways, this makes BasicSwap more akin to the typical centralized exchanges most people are used to trading on, but with a totally decentralized and private twist.</p><p>Note that, unlike the vast majority of DEXs that offer order books, BasicSwap’s order book system is truly distributed and doesn’t introduce any form of centralization. No funny business here; BasicSwap makes it truly impossible, by design, for any third-party to have uncalled influence on the platform, and that's provably verifiable through code! The order book is powered by Particl’s own P2P network, <a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_mp_explained.html#the-securemessaging-smsg-protocol\">SMSG network</a>, which is the same network that powers <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\"><strong>Particl Marketplace</strong></a>.</p><p>The main benefit of having an order book system is that you can swap coins at the exact price that you want to swap them for. It also attracts more traditional market makers who may not want to provide liquidity to smart-contract based liquidity pools due to the risks of <a href=\"https://learn.bybit.com/investing/why-crypto-rug-pulls-happen-in-defi/\">rug pulls</a> and other theoretical exploits they carry.</p><p>But there’s more coming to BasicSwap! You can expect “quick swaps” to be deployed at some point in the future. As a matter of fact, this is already being looked into at the time of this writing! We will let you know more about it as soon (™) as we can!</p><h3 id=\"true-cross-chain-swaps\">True Cross-Chain Swaps</h3><p>Particl’s upcoming DEXs is a true cross-chain trading exchange. Unlike other DEX, BasicSwap does not mimic cross-chain interoperability. You’ll exchange one native coin for another one without any unsafe trickery!</p><p>You can swap one coin (i.e., Bitcoin) for one from another blockchain (i.e., Monero). And no, we’re not just talking about swapping coins between different Ethereum forks here (i.e., ETH to BSC). Moreover, BasicSwap doesn’t require coins to be wrapped into tokens of another chain (often Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or other similar chains).</p><h3 id=\"the-world-s-most-private-trading-exchange\">The World’s Most Private Trading Exchange</h3><p>To top it off, BasicSwap is inherently private. But what does that mean?! Well, it means a few things. For one, you won’t need to create an account, send documents, verify yourself, or limit your trading activities to arbitrary maximum daily restrictions. It’s open to all, without any restriction, and without any care about who you are or where you live.</p><p>That’s already a major improvement over centralized exchanges that have become way too curious, but you can take things even further! You can indeed massively increase your level of privacy by swapping any cryptocurrency for privacy coins like Particl or Monero, or by using them as a gateway to add a layer of privacy between two \"public coins\" (i.e,. Bitcoin and Litecoin). </p><p>Indeed, all Monero transactions are inherently private, and BasicSwap lets you swap PART using any of its privacy states; public, blind (<a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\">ConfidentialTransactions</a>), or anon (<a href=\"https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\">RingCT</a>). We’re planning on eventually enabling more private swap options through other privacy coins as well (i.e., Firo, Veil, etc).</p><p>But there is STILL more to come in regards to privacy! As we move forward and deploy the Taproot protocol on Particl, you can expect swaps of Bitcoin-style currencies to become indistinguishable from regular transactions. In other words, it will be eventually near-impossible to tell that, for example, a Bitcoin to Particl swap has occurred just by looking at their respective blockchains. That’s a major win for your financial privacy!</p><p>Indeed, enabling Taproot support is planned for a later stage of the Open Beta. That's one of the reasons why Particl's blockchain is always kept up-to-date with Bitcoin’s latest releases. It brings battle-hardened and reliable functionalities for your day-to-day financial sovereignty!</p><p>The combination of all these privacy-related features will make BasicSwap the world’s most private and unrestricted trading exchange, and that, in turn, will make you completely financially independent. Claim your sovereignty and live free...because, well, now you can!</p><h3 id=\"other-interesting-features\">Other Interesting Features</h3><p>There are a couple of other features that you may find interesting. As BasicSwap will become an important development focus moving forward, this list is expected to grow gradually.</p><ul><li>True Monero support</li><li>No account, sign up, or KYC</li><li>Incredibly low and competitive fees</li><li>User-friendly interface</li><li>No third-party, intermediary, or middleman at any point</li><li>Taproot compatible</li><li>Lightning Network compatible (in later versions)</li></ul><h2 id=\"what-about-monetization\">What About Monetization?</h2><p>As BasicSwap is entirely decentralized, no single party can earn profits from swaps made on the platform. That’d be very...centralized! But rest assured, we absolutely intend on turning Particl’s upcoming DEX into the spark that will cause the Particl project to go viral. Indeed, we are strongly confident that the DEX was the missing piece all along.</p><p>Indeed, it’s likely that a very small and competitive fee will be charged for using the DEX. But instead of having a third-party collecting them, it’s the entire Particl community who will benefit from them. All fees paid for using the DEX will be either converted into PART and burned, redistributed to stakers, or used as a liquidity incentive. A combination of these three strategies is likely to be what’s going to be deployed, although we haven’t finalized the strategy just yet and are still experimenting with different approaches.</p><p>In other words, we are working towards building BasicSwap in such a way that, as more people swap coins on the platform, the more demand there will be for the PART coin, the less available supply there will be, and the more valuable your staking rewards will be. And that’s just one application out of many others on the Particl ecosystem (Particl Marketplace has a similar dynamic as well).</p><p>Keep in mind that we want BasicSwap to provide an experience that has as little friction as possible. We also want any fee charged to remain very competitive with industry standards and, obviously, legally viable.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-it-compare\">How Does it Compare</h2><p>We know we know, there are many exchanges around, both centralized and decentralized. But we’re very confident that BasicSwap stands on its own and offers something quite unique.</p><p>In the interest of making it clear how BasicSwap differentiates itself from other trading platforms, here’s a brief breakdown of the differences with some of the other solutions around.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">Bittrex, Binance, Coinbase, etc.</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p> <strong>Compared to centralized exchanges...</strong>\n                        </br>\n                        </br>\n                            <li>You control your keys at any point in time</li>\n                            <li>You don't have to create an account or submit any document</li>\n                            <li>You don't need to verify yourself (KYC)</li>\n                            <li>There's no upper limit as to how much you can trade per period of time</li>\n                            <li>You remain private every step of the way</li>\n                            <li>There's no third-party, middleman, or intermediary involved at all</li>\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck2\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck2\">Uniswap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, etc.</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p> <strong>Compared to “quick swap” exchanges with liquidity pools…</strong>\n                        <br>\n\n                        </br>\n                            <li>You can place or take orders on a distributed order book</li>\n                            <li>You swap your coins at the exact price that you want</li>\n                            <li>Swaps are truly cross-chain;

With BasicSwap, Particl becomes resilient against any exchange delisting and ensures the longevity of the project no matter what gets thrown at it. In other words, it makes Particl permanently unstoppable!</p><h3 id=\"promoting-and-supporting-financial-sovereignty\">Promoting and Supporting Financial Sovereignty</h3><p>At this time, with all of the promises and potential that cryptocurrencies yield, speculation is still their number one use case. Every day, billions upon billions worth of dollars in cryptocurrencies are traded on exchanges, both centralized and decentralized.</p><p>Furthermore, with the looming aggressive regulations that certain countries wish to impose on crypto, especially towards coins that protect your private life, centralized exchanges have been more and more restrictive while asking for more and more information about you and your funds. This locks several people out of trading cryptocurrencies in a practical matter and this problem is expected to accentuate as we move forward. Keep in mind, this is far from being a Particl-centric issue, but rather an industry-wide issue that’s impacting thousands if not millions of users, daily.</p><p>With this in mind, BasicSwap is a beacon of light in an environment that grows darker by the day for those who care about their financial sovereignty. By giving anyone the ability to easily swap cryptocurrencies from one chain to another, without any sort of restriction or overreaching requirements, it allows people to remain independent and keep their financial details to themselves.</p><p>As a matter of fact, never ever will BasicSwap ask you for any information or restrict you from using its services based on arbitrary rules such as who you are, where you live, or what your transaction history may look like; it’s entirely decentralized, autonomous, and open to all! This, alone, is bound to attract freedom lovers, giving the Particl project much deserved attention from this audience.</p><h3 id=\"exposure-for-the-project\">Exposure for the Project</h3><p>Because of how the Particl ecosystem and its distributed apps are all interconnected, we expect a non-negligible portion of BasicSwap users to start using other Particl apps and become Particl-wide users. That’s likely to accentuate much more as soon as the DEX gets integrated into Particl Desktop. After all, there’s much more to trading crypto, you’ve got to spend your gains as well! And, lo and behold, that’s precisely what Particl Marketplace lets you do (and you STILL stay completely private when doing so).</p><p>For this reason, BasicSwap is eventually going to become a major focus in terms of communications, marketing, PR, and outreach efforts, on the same level and as a complement to the marketplace.</p><p>That being said, the upcoming release of BasicSwap is a golden opportunity for Particl to become viral and become successful. Remember, billions upon billions worth of cryptocurrencies are traded every day, and BasicSwap’s unique set of features is bound to capture even just a tiny fraction of that pie.</p><p>Indeed, as the main use-case for cryptocurrencies is currently speculation, releasing a highly functional and one-of-a-kind cross-chain and private DEX is a major bid in that direction. We highly encourage you all to help us spread the good word about it to kick start its adoption. For all of us in the community, it’s sure going to bring a breath of fresh air to be able to market a new product other than the marketplace!</p><h3 id=\"easier-user-onboarding-for-particl-marketplace\">Easier User Onboarding for Particl Marketplace</h3><p>All payments on <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</a> are private. That's why you need to hold some PART coins in your \"anon balance\" to use it. The anon balance is where the coins that you own that are in the RingCT privacy state (<strong><a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_part_coin.html#privacy-specifications\">click here to learn more</a></strong>) are located.</p><p>And because all current PART exchanges (i.e., Bittrex, Probit, WizardSwap, etc.) work using public balances only, getting started with the marketplace requires new users to go through a few additional, manual steps to transfer coins from their public balance to the anon one. This has often been reported as a significant challenge to the marketplace's adoption, and BasicSwap provides a simple solution to that problem.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, BasicSwap lets you swap PART using the balance type of your choice. You can swap it against almost any other cryptocurrency, for example, Bitcoin, and use either your public, blind, or anon (marketplace-ready) balances to send or receive the PART. If you choose to swap the Bitcoin for PART using your anon balance, then as soon as the swap completes, you'll be ready to use the marketplace right away!</p><h3 id=\"increasing-demand-for-part-decreasing-supply-and-growing-staking-rewards\">Increasing Demand for PART, Decreasing Supply, and Growing Staking Rewards</h3><p>As you now know, we are looking into several monetization mechanisms to benefit the entire Particl ecosystem for the success of BasicSwap. Mind you, nothing is set in stone yet, but this includes mechanisms that would increase the demand for PART, reduce its circulating supply (<strong>burning coins</strong>), and introduce incentives for providing liquidity.</p><p>Of course, it’s very important to keep the costs of using the DEX as low as possible so that it remains competitive with other solutions. It’s also important to keep it as frictionless as possible because the easier it is to use, the more people will use it. We'll communicate to the community what monetization strategies will be deployed as early as we can!</p><h2 id=\"when-is-the-open-beta-going-live\">When is the Open Beta Going Live?</h2><p>Currently, BasicSwap is in closed beta and has been in a testing phase for several months now. An Open Beta, on mainnet and open to the public, is now just about to launch. While we cannot yet give an estimate on its launch date, we expect it to go live before the end of the year 2021 as a nice end-of-year present to the community. Keep in mind, that is not guaranteed and should not be considered any sort of official estimate; this is however what we’re hoping for.</p><h3 id=\"what-to-expect-from-the-open-beta\">What to Expect From the Open Beta?</h3><p>By any means, the Open Beta is not intended to be a finished product and will still very much be a beta product in beta phase. As such, you can expect a rough experience that isn’t all that much focused on user-friendliness. As its name implies, the “Open Beta” is intended to beta test the core features of the DEX and to ensure that the back-end works safely and as expected over a vast selection of environments and situations.</p><p>Here are a few notes of what you can expect from the upcoming Open Beta phase.</p><ul><li>Full mainnet functionality with swaps working with real coins</li><li>Compatibility with Bitcoin, Monero, Litecoin, Namecoin, and Particl. More coins will be added incrementally, especially around the time of the full release. We are already in touch with a few projects for integrations; the number of coins available on the DEX may grow rapidly once that becomes a bigger focus.</li><li>You will need to manually build the client following a set of instructions. There won’t be executables or one-click options to get started just yet, but rest assured that we have great solutions in the pipeline to simplify onboarding as much as possible.</li><li>A basic, barebone, and temporary user interface. The Open Beta won’t use, at least not to start with, any of the standalone or Particl Desktop mockups that we’ve shared in the past just yet. The Open Beta is for testers to test the back-end and technical features and is generally recommended for the more advanced types of users.</li><li>You will need to sync the blockchain of most of the coins you want to swap (excluding Monero, which you can simply sync to a public node). We plan on taking that requirement away in future versions of BasicSwap.</li><li>As with any beta software, you might encounter bugs or weird behaviors. Don’t worry, that’s why we’re doing an extensive Beta phase! So far, we are happy to confirm that, due to the safe and fail-proof nature of atomic swaps, we (including the closed beta group of testers) haven’t encountered any swap that failed and resulted in the loss of coins. Still, do keep in mind that it’s better to be safe than sorry and to ideally trade small amounts rather than large ones. It’s still early technology after all!</li></ul><p>Of course, that is not all. We have many surprises in the works which we intend on revealing soon (™). We are likely to add surprise features throughout the lifecycle of this Open Beta phase, so as we often say; stay tuned!</p><h3 id=\"what-s-left-to-do-before-the-open-beta-goes-live\">What’s Left to do Before the Open Beta Goes Live?</h3><p>As we rapidly near the release of the Open Beta, we’re checking off the last few items that remain on the to-do list. In reality, there isn’t much left to do as an insane amount of work has been silently going towards BasicSwap for several months now. Here are the last items needed to be completed before the Open Beta release.</p><ul><li>More testing and optimizations, notably related to the building and installation process.</li><li>Finish up the temporary UI for the Open Beta so that it’s easier to test.</li><li>Catching and fixing edge-case issues and other minor bugs.</li></ul><p>Once these items are completed, we’ll be ready to release the BasicSwap Open Beta to the public. We’ll clearly communicate, as soon as we can, when it will go live.</p><hr><p>As we’ve hopefully made clear by now, we have big plans for BasicSwap and strongly believe it can make Particl go viral and speed up the adoption and success of the entire Particl platform. Perhaps more importantly, it is a major play towards preserving everyone’s freedom and financial sovereignty. The benefits BasicSwap opens up to the cryptocurrency industry go much, much further than simply being helpful for the Particl community.</p><p>As such, we have a lot more planned than what we’ve mentioned in this blog post, but we obviously don’t want to play all of our cards yet. After all, the infamous “soon (™)” motto has to live on! ?</p><p>So, most definitely keep a keen eye on Particl News and look out for any update either in blog posts dedicated to BasicSwap or in our weekly development progress reports.

It’s a platform that hosts different apps that respect your rights, freedoms, and privacy without any compromise. While it’s still under heavy development, Particl aspires to become an all-inclusive and circular economy that people can use to opt-out of the current global financial system. In other words, it’s all about personal freedom and financial sovereignty.</p><p>In many ways, the ultimate vision of the platform can be compared as a sort of “decentralized and private WeChat-like ecosystem” where you can get all the key services or products you need right at your fingertips. Alternatively, you can also see it as an OS-like platform for distributed apps. In any case, Particl is an ecosystem of distributed apps, or “dapps”, where independence from any third-party or service provider is absolute. And BasicSwap is an incredibly important step towards that vision.</p><p>In fact, as the Particl ecosystem enables you to become truly financially independent, it’s easy to understand how an equally independent, resilient, and unstoppable way to buy and sell the platform’s native currency (PART) is required. However, at the time of this writing, PART is only available through centralized exchanges or by unprotected OTC deals between two people. While centralized exchanges (i.e., <a href=\"https://global.bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-PART\">Bittrex</a>, <a href=\"https://wizardswap.io/\">WizardSwap</a>) can provide many benefits and unique features, <strong>not having any decentralized option is not an option for a platform that seeks to be uncompromisingly independent</strong>. But that’s all about to change!</p><p>Now let’s dive deeper into BasicSwap and let’s see how it’s going to become a cornerstone for the entire Particl ecosystem. We'll also detail how it will become a competitive and vibrant trading platform for all cryptocurrencies that end up on it.</p><h2 id=\"the-basicswap-dex-explained\">The BasicSwap DEX Explained</h2><p>Keeping in mind that the Particl ecosystem is your gateway into a completely independent and autonomous economy, it’s vital to be able to acquire (and sell or trade) the platform’s native currency in an equally independent, safe, fast, and decentralized way. That’s precisely what the BasicSwap DEX enables you to do, but it doesn’t stop at just buying and selling PART.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 1000w, /glink/size/w1600/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 1600w, /glink/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 1823w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption>Mockup of BasicSwap's UI | Work-in-progress that is subject to change</figcaption></figure><p>BasicSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol. It lets you swap one cryptocurrency for another from a different chain (cross-chain). It’s also private by nature. </p><p>Swaps are made directly person-to-person, without any intermediary, using a distributed order book. Every single aspect of the BasicSwap protocol is decentralized and open-source, so you don’t have to take our word for it; you can check the code yourself!</p><h2 id=\"list-of-compatible-coins\">List of Compatible Coins</h2><ul><li>Bitcoin</li><li>Monero</li><li>Particl</li><li>Litecoin</li><li>Namecoin</li></ul><p>We are looking at adding various coins, including ETH and its ERC-20 tokens, shortly after the release of the Open Beta. Any Bitcoin-based and Segwit enabled cryptocurrency can get integrated with minimal effort. Other token issuing blockchains like Fantom, Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, or Binance Smart Chain may become available on BasicSwap as well, at a later stage of the integration roadmap.</p><h2 id=\"key-features\">Key Features</h2><p>BasicSwap is a one-of-its-kind DEX in the blockchain industry. While it offers many benefits against centralized exchanges, it has three main distinguishing features that set it apart from other decentralized exchanges.</p><h3 id=\"distributed-order-books\">Distributed Order Books</h3><p>BasicSwap’s first version will focus on trading with an order book. Instead of swapping your coins into a liquidity pool (like on Uniswap, SushiSwap, or PancakeSwap), you can either place an order on the distributed order book (maker), at the price that you want, or take an order that has already been placed on there by other swappers (taker). In many ways, this makes BasicSwap more akin to the typical centralized exchanges most people are used to trading on, but with a totally decentralized and private twist.</p><p>Note that, unlike the vast majority of DEXs that offer order books, BasicSwap’s order book system is truly distributed and doesn’t introduce any form of centralization. No funny business here; BasicSwap makes it truly impossible, by design, for any third-party to have uncalled influence on the platform, and that's provably verifiable through code! The order book is powered by Particl’s own P2P network, <a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_mp_explained.html#the-securemessaging-smsg-protocol\">SMSG network</a>, which is the same network that powers <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\"><strong>Particl Marketplace</strong></a>.</p><p>The main benefit of having an order book system is that you can swap coins at the exact price that you want to swap them for. It also attracts more traditional market makers who may not want to provide liquidity to smart-contract based liquidity pools due to the risks of <a href=\"https://learn.bybit.com/investing/why-crypto-rug-pulls-happen-in-defi/\">rug pulls</a> and other theoretical exploits they carry.</p><p>But there’s more coming to BasicSwap! You can expect “quick swaps” to be deployed at some point in the future. As a matter of fact, this is already being looked into at the time of this writing! We will let you know more about it as soon (™) as we can!</p><h3 id=\"true-cross-chain-swaps\">True Cross-Chain Swaps</h3><p>Particl’s upcoming DEXs is a true cross-chain trading exchange. Unlike other DEX, BasicSwap does not mimic cross-chain interoperability. You’ll exchange one native coin for another one without any unsafe trickery!</p><p>You can swap one coin (i.e., Bitcoin) for one from another blockchain (i.e., Monero). And no, we’re not just talking about swapping coins between different Ethereum forks here (i.e., ETH to BSC). Moreover, BasicSwap doesn’t require coins to be wrapped into tokens of another chain (often Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or other similar chains).</p><h3 id=\"the-world-s-most-private-trading-exchange\">The World’s Most Private Trading Exchange</h3><p>To top it off, BasicSwap is inherently private. But what does that mean?! Well, it means a few things. For one, you won’t need to create an account, send documents, verify yourself, or limit your trading activities to arbitrary maximum daily restrictions. It’s open to all, without any restriction, and without any care about who you are or where you live.</p><p>That’s already a major improvement over centralized exchanges that have become way too curious, but you can take things even further! You can indeed massively increase your level of privacy by swapping any cryptocurrency for privacy coins like Particl or Monero, or by using them as a gateway to add a layer of privacy between two \"public coins\" (i.e,. Bitcoin and Litecoin). </p><p>Indeed, all Monero transactions are inherently private, and BasicSwap lets you swap PART using any of its privacy states; public, blind (<a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\">ConfidentialTransactions</a>), or anon (<a href=\"https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\">RingCT</a>). We’re planning on eventually enabling more private swap options through other privacy coins as well (i.e., Firo, Veil, etc).</p><p>But there is STILL more to come in regards to privacy! As we move forward and deploy the Taproot protocol on Particl, you can expect swaps of Bitcoin-style currencies to become indistinguishable from regular transactions. In other words, it will be eventually near-impossible to tell that, for example, a Bitcoin to Particl swap has occurred just by looking at their respective blockchains. That’s a major win for your financial privacy!</p><p>Indeed, enabling Taproot support is planned for a later stage of the Open Beta. That's one of the reasons why Particl's blockchain is always kept up-to-date with Bitcoin’s latest releases. It brings battle-hardened and reliable functionalities for your day-to-day financial sovereignty!</p><p>The combination of all these privacy-related features will make BasicSwap the world’s most private and unrestricted trading exchange, and that, in turn, will make you completely financially independent. Claim your sovereignty and live free...because, well, now you can!</p><h3 id=\"other-interesting-features\">Other Interesting Features</h3><p>There are a couple of other features that you may find interesting. As BasicSwap will become an important development focus moving forward, this list is expected to grow gradually.</p><ul><li>True Monero support</li><li>No account, sign up, or KYC</li><li>Incredibly low and competitive fees</li><li>User-friendly interface</li><li>No third-party, intermediary, or middleman at any point</li><li>Taproot compatible</li><li>Lightning Network compatible (in later versions)</li></ul><h2 id=\"what-about-monetization\">What About Monetization?</h2><p>As BasicSwap is entirely decentralized, no single party can earn profits from swaps made on the platform. That’d be very...centralized! But rest assured, we absolutely intend on turning Particl’s upcoming DEX into the spark that will cause the Particl project to go viral. Indeed, we are strongly confident that the DEX was the missing piece all along.</p><p>Indeed, it’s likely that a very small and competitive fee will be charged for using the DEX. But instead of having a third-party collecting them, it’s the entire Particl community who will benefit from them. All fees paid for using the DEX will be either converted into PART and burned, redistributed to stakers, or used as a liquidity incentive. A combination of these three strategies is likely to be what’s going to be deployed, although we haven’t finalized the strategy just yet and are still experimenting with different approaches.</p><p>In other words, we are working towards building BasicSwap in such a way that, as more people swap coins on the platform, the more demand there will be for the PART coin, the less available supply there will be, and the more valuable your staking rewards will be. And that’s just one application out of many others on the Particl ecosystem (Particl Marketplace has a similar dynamic as well).</p><p>Keep in mind that we want BasicSwap to provide an experience that has as little friction as possible. We also want any fee charged to remain very competitive with industry standards and, obviously, legally viable.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-it-compare\">How Does it Compare</h2><p>We know we know, there are many exchanges around, both centralized and decentralized. But we’re very confident that BasicSwap stands on its own and offers something quite unique.</p><p>In the interest of making it clear how BasicSwap differentiates itself from other trading platforms, here’s a brief breakdown of the differences with some of the other solutions around.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">Bittrex, Binance, Coinbase, etc.</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p> <strong>Compared to centralized exchanges...</strong>\n                        <br>\n                        <br>\n                            </p><li>You control your keys at any point in time</li>\n                            <li>You don't have to create an account or submit any document</li>\n                            <li>You don't need to verify yourself (KYC)</li>\n                            <li>There's no upper limit as to how much you can trade per period of time</li>\n                            <li>You remain private every step of the way</li>\n                            <li>There's no third-party, middleman, or intermediary involved at all</li>\n                        <p></p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck2\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck2\">Uniswap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, etc.</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p> <strong>Compared to “quick swap” exchanges with liquidity pools…</strong>\n                        <br>\n\n                        <br>\n                            </p><li>You can place or take orders on a distributed order book</li>\n                            <li>You swap your coins at the exact price that you want</li>\n                            <li>Swaps are truly cross-chain;

With BasicSwap, Particl becomes resilient against any exchange delisting and ensures the longevity of the project no matter what gets thrown at it. In other words, it makes Particl permanently unstoppable!</p><h3 id=\"promoting-and-supporting-financial-sovereignty\">Promoting and Supporting Financial Sovereignty</h3><p>At this time, with all of the promises and potential that cryptocurrencies yield, speculation is still their number one use case. Every day, billions upon billions worth of dollars in cryptocurrencies are traded on exchanges, both centralized and decentralized.</p><p>Furthermore, with the looming aggressive regulations that certain countries wish to impose on crypto, especially towards coins that protect your private life, centralized exchanges have been more and more restrictive while asking for more and more information about you and your funds. This locks several people out of trading cryptocurrencies in a practical matter and this problem is expected to accentuate as we move forward. Keep in mind, this is far from being a Particl-centric issue, but rather an industry-wide issue that’s impacting thousands if not millions of users, daily.</p><p>With this in mind, BasicSwap is a beacon of light in an environment that grows darker by the day for those who care about their financial sovereignty. By giving anyone the ability to easily swap cryptocurrencies from one chain to another, without any sort of restriction or overreaching requirements, it allows people to remain independent and keep their financial details to themselves.</p><p>As a matter of fact, never ever will BasicSwap ask you for any information or restrict you from using its services based on arbitrary rules such as who you are, where you live, or what your transaction history may look like; it’s entirely decentralized, autonomous, and open to all! This, alone, is bound to attract freedom lovers, giving the Particl project much deserved attention from this audience.</p><h3 id=\"exposure-for-the-project\">Exposure for the Project</h3><p>Because of how the Particl ecosystem and its distributed apps are all interconnected, we expect a non-negligible portion of BasicSwap users to start using other Particl apps and become Particl-wide users. That’s likely to accentuate much more as soon as the DEX gets integrated into Particl Desktop. After all, there’s much more to trading crypto, you’ve got to spend your gains as well! And, lo and behold, that’s precisely what Particl Marketplace lets you do (and you STILL stay completely private when doing so).</p><p>For this reason, BasicSwap is eventually going to become a major focus in terms of communications, marketing, PR, and outreach efforts, on the same level and as a complement to the marketplace.</p><p>That being said, the upcoming release of BasicSwap is a golden opportunity for Particl to become viral and become successful. Remember, billions upon billions worth of cryptocurrencies are traded every day, and BasicSwap’s unique set of features is bound to capture even just a tiny fraction of that pie.</p><p>Indeed, as the main use-case for cryptocurrencies is currently speculation, releasing a highly functional and one-of-a-kind cross-chain and private DEX is a major bid in that direction. We highly encourage you all to help us spread the good word about it to kick start its adoption. For all of us in the community, it’s sure going to bring a breath of fresh air to be able to market a new product other than the marketplace!</p><h3 id=\"easier-user-onboarding-for-particl-marketplace\">Easier User Onboarding for Particl Marketplace</h3><p>All payments on <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</a> are private. That's why you need to hold some PART coins in your \"anon balance\" to use it. The anon balance is where the coins that you own that are in the RingCT privacy state (<strong><a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_part_coin.html#privacy-specifications\">click here to learn more</a></strong>) are located.</p><p>And because all current PART exchanges (i.e., Bittrex, Probit, WizardSwap, etc.) work using public balances only, getting started with the marketplace requires new users to go through a few additional, manual steps to transfer coins from their public balance to the anon one. This has often been reported as a significant challenge to the marketplace's adoption, and BasicSwap provides a simple solution to that problem.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, BasicSwap lets you swap PART using the balance type of your choice. You can swap it against almost any other cryptocurrency, for example, Bitcoin, and use either your public, blind, or anon (marketplace-ready) balances to send or receive the PART. If you choose to swap the Bitcoin for PART using your anon balance, then as soon as the swap completes, you'll be ready to use the marketplace right away!</p><h3 id=\"increasing-demand-for-part-decreasing-supply-and-growing-staking-rewards\">Increasing Demand for PART, Decreasing Supply, and Growing Staking Rewards</h3><p>As you now know, we are looking into several monetization mechanisms to benefit the entire Particl ecosystem for the success of BasicSwap. Mind you, nothing is set in stone yet, but this includes mechanisms that would increase the demand for PART, reduce its circulating supply (<strong>burning coins</strong>), and introduce incentives for providing liquidity.</p><p>Of course, it’s very important to keep the costs of using the DEX as low as possible so that it remains competitive with other solutions. It’s also important to keep it as frictionless as possible because the easier it is to use, the more people will use it. We'll communicate to the community what monetization strategies will be deployed as early as we can!</p><h2 id=\"when-is-the-open-beta-going-live\">When is the Open Beta Going Live?</h2><p>Currently, BasicSwap is in closed beta and has been in a testing phase for several months now. An Open Beta, on mainnet and open to the public, is now just about to launch. While we cannot yet give an estimate on its launch date, we expect it to go live before the end of the year 2021 as a nice end-of-year present to the community. Keep in mind, that is not guaranteed and should not be considered any sort of official estimate; this is however what we’re hoping for.</p><h3 id=\"what-to-expect-from-the-open-beta\">What to Expect From the Open Beta?</h3><p>By any means, the Open Beta is not intended to be a finished product and will still very much be a beta product in beta phase. As such, you can expect a rough experience that isn’t all that much focused on user-friendliness. As its name implies, the “Open Beta” is intended to beta test the core features of the DEX and to ensure that the back-end works safely and as expected over a vast selection of environments and situations.</p><p>Here are a few notes of what you can expect from the upcoming Open Beta phase.</p><ul><li>Full mainnet functionality with swaps working with real coins</li><li>Compatibility with Bitcoin, Monero, Litecoin, Namecoin, and Particl. More coins will be added incrementally, especially around the time of the full release. We are already in touch with a few projects for integrations; the number of coins available on the DEX may grow rapidly once that becomes a bigger focus.</li><li>You will need to manually build the client following a set of instructions. There won’t be executables or one-click options to get started just yet, but rest assured that we have great solutions in the pipeline to simplify onboarding as much as possible.</li><li>A basic, barebone, and temporary user interface. The Open Beta won’t use, at least not to start with, any of the standalone or Particl Desktop mockups that we’ve shared in the past just yet. The Open Beta is for testers to test the back-end and technical features and is generally recommended for the more advanced types of users.</li><li>You will need to sync the blockchain of most of the coins you want to swap (excluding Monero, which you can simply sync to a public node). We plan on taking that requirement away in future versions of BasicSwap.</li><li>As with any beta software, you might encounter bugs or weird behaviors. Don’t worry, that’s why we’re doing an extensive Beta phase! So far, we are happy to confirm that, due to the safe and fail-proof nature of atomic swaps, we (including the closed beta group of testers) haven’t encountered any swap that failed and resulted in the loss of coins. Still, do keep in mind that it’s better to be safe than sorry and to ideally trade small amounts rather than large ones. It’s still early technology after all!</li></ul><p>Of course, that is not all. We have many surprises in the works which we intend on revealing soon (™). We are likely to add surprise features throughout the lifecycle of this Open Beta phase, so as we often say; stay tuned!</p><h3 id=\"what-s-left-to-do-before-the-open-beta-goes-live\">What’s Left to do Before the Open Beta Goes Live?</h3><p>As we rapidly near the release of the Open Beta, we’re checking off the last few items that remain on the to-do list. In reality, there isn’t much left to do as an insane amount of work has been silently going towards BasicSwap for several months now. Here are the last items needed to be completed before the Open Beta release.</p><ul><li>More testing and optimizations, notably related to the building and installation process.</li><li>Finish up the temporary UI for the Open Beta so that it’s easier to test.</li><li>Catching and fixing edge-case issues and other minor bugs.</li></ul><p>Once these items are completed, we’ll be ready to release the BasicSwap Open Beta to the public. We’ll clearly communicate, as soon as we can, when it will go live.</p><hr><p>As we’ve hopefully made clear by now, we have big plans for BasicSwap and strongly believe it can make Particl go viral and speed up the adoption and success of the entire Particl platform. Perhaps more importantly, it is a major play towards preserving everyone’s freedom and financial sovereignty. The benefits BasicSwap opens up to the cryptocurrency industry go much, much further than simply being helpful for the Particl community.</p><p>As such, we have a lot more planned than what we’ve mentioned in this blog post, but we obviously don’t want to play all of our cards yet. After all, the infamous “soon (™)” motto has to live on! ?</p><p>So, most definitely keep a keen eye on Particl News and look out for any update either in blog posts dedicated to BasicSwap or in our weekly development progress reports. You’re bound to be mesmerized!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
