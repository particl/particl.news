This script combines local LLM technology with Particl's existing\nmoderation framework to create an automated system that maintains our core\nvalues of privacy and decentralization while significantly reducing the burden\non users.\n\nBuilt using Python, this new solution operates entirely on your local device. It\nanalyzes marketplace listings using locally-run, lightweight LLM models,\nrequiring no external API calls or interaction with third-party services. Your\ndata stays on your machine, with the script establishing connections exclusively\nto Particl Marketplace itself. The application runs on virtually any computing\nenvironment — from powerful workstations to modest setups like Raspberry Pis or\nvirtual machines, supporting Windows, MacOS, and Linux operating systems.\n\nYou can access the script and its documentation through our Github repository: \nhttps://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script\n\nHow We Got Here: The Current Moderation System\nThis release builds on top of Particl Marketplace's initial moderation system\n(v0.1), a decentralized approach that puts moderation control directly in users'\nhands. This system has served the marketplace well since launch, but as the\nplatform grew, we identified opportunities to improve its efficiency and\npro-activity while maintaining its decentralized nature.\n\nThe current system implements a sophisticated voting mechanism that shares some\nconceptual similarities with Reddit's upvote/downvote system, but with crucial\ndifferences that make it suitable for a decentralized environment. When users\nencounter potentially problematic listings, they can flag them, directly on the\napplication, for community review. These flagged items then appear on a public\nlist where the community can either support the original flag through additional\ndownvotes or contest it with upvotes.\n\nContent removal follows strict mathematical thresholds rather than arbitrary\ndecisions. A listing is only removed when its negative votes exceed 0.1% of\nParticl's total coin supply. For example, assuming a total Particl coin supply\nof 15,000,000 coins, a listing requires a net negative vote weight of 15,000\ncoins to be removed.\n\nImportantly, votes aren't calculated on a one-user-one-vote basis. Since\nParticl's decentralized architecture makes it trivial to create multiple\naddresses, the system instead weighs votes based on the number of coins in the\nvoting wallet. This prevents gaming the system, as coins can't be fabricated\nwithin an address. The more stake you hold, the more influence your vote\ncarries.\n\nAddressing Current Limitations\nWhile this system has proven effective at maintaining marketplace standards, its\ncontinued usage has highlighted two significant challenges:\n\nFirst, the system requires constant attention from active users to maintain\neffective moderation. This creates an ongoing burden on the community and can\nlead to inconsistent moderation coverage during periods of lower user activity.\n\nSecond, and more critically, the reactive nature of the system means users must\nbe exposed to potentially undesirable content before they can vote to remove it.\nWhile early adopters and technology enthusiasts might accept this as a necessary\ntrade-off to enjoy unapologetic decentralization, it presents a significant\nbarrier to broader adoption, particularly among more mainstream users.\n\nThese challenges demanded a solution that could maintain our commitment to\ndecentralization and privacy while reducing the burden on users and improving\nthe marketplace experience.\n\nThe Promise of Local LLM Technology\nThe breakthrough came with recent advances in Large Language Model technology.\nWhile the spotlight often falls on centralized services like OpenAI's ChatGPT,\nAnthropic's Claude, or Google's Gemini, they conflict with Particl's\nprivacy-focused ethos and pose scaling challenges; more listings would mean\nhigher total API costs.\n\nIndeed, the real innovation for our purposes has been in local and open models.\nThese models can now run effectively on personal devices while achieving\naccuracy rates comparable to their cloud-based counterparts, all without ever\nconnecting to third-party service providers.\n\nThis technological advancement presented an opportunity to significantly improve\nParticl Marketplace’s moderation system with context-based analysis without\ncompromising on core principles. While using centralized LLM services through\nAPIs would have conflicted with Particl's privacy-focused ethos and introduced\nscaling challenges, local models offered a perfect fit for our needs.\n\nThe New Automated Moderation Script\nGitHub - cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script: Automated, LLM-powered\ncontent moderation script for Particl Marketplace. Runs entirely local without\nconnections to 3rd-parties.Automated, LLM-powered content moderation script for\nParticl Marketplace. Runs entirely local without connections to 3rd-parties. -\ncryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-scriptGitHubcryptoguard\n[https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script]We’re proud to\nintroduce, today, a new script that automates the process of moderating Particl\nMarketplace content with minimal user input.\n\nOperating Modes\nThe script offers two distinct approaches to marketplace moderation: manual mode \nand continuous mode.\n\nScript's main menuIn manual mode, you maintain complete control through a CLI menu interface that\nlets you oversee each step of the process. This gives you the ability to review\nand adjust moderation decisions before they reach the network, making it\nespecially valuable during your initial setup phase or when testing new\nmoderation rules.\n\nOptions for the script's manual modeContinuous mode transforms this process into an autonomous operation. The script\nindependently cycles through scanning the marketplace for new listings,\nanalyzing each one, applying moderation decisions, and broadcasting votes to the\nnetwork. After completing this sequence, it begins anew with another marketplace\nscan. While this mode significantly improves moderation efficiency and reduces\nuser exposure to undesirable content, we strongly recommend implementing it only\nafter thoroughly testing your rules in manual mode.\n\nRule System and Analysis\nAt the heart of this script's moderation process lies a sophisticated rule\nsystem powered by local LLM models. These models continuously monitor\nmarketplace activity, evaluating new listings against your predefined criteria.\nEach rule can trigger one of three actions: downvote, upvote, or ignore, giving\nyou precise control over the moderation process.\n\nThe system accepts rules in both keyword format and natural language\ndescriptions, offering flexibility in how you define your moderation parameters.\nTo help you get started, we've included a comprehensive set of template rules\naccessible through the CLI menu. These templates serve dual purposes — providing\nimmediate functionality and demonstrating effective rule construction. You can\nuse them as-is, modify them to better align with your specific needs, or\nentirely replace them with custom rules of your own.\n\nFor those interested in creating custom rules, we've included a diverse set of\ntest listings spanning various categories — from standard marketplace items to\nprohibited products and contentious cases designed to put custom rules to the\ntest. This test dataset proves invaluable in evaluating and refining your rules\nbefore deploying them in the live marketplace.\n\nThe Judgement Engine\nProcessed listing browser using example moderation rules (these are entirely\nuser-defined)The judgement system employs a carefully designed approach to\ncontent analysis. The local LLM model examines both listing titles and\ndescriptions, but with an important distinction in its methodology. Rather than\nusing potentially biased terms like 'illegal', 'remove', or ‘unethical’ when\nclassifying, it categorizes listings using neutral terms such as 'true',\n'false', or 'ignore'. This neutral framework ensures the model remains flexible\nand unbiased, capable of handling highly specific custom rules without\npredetermined assumptions.\n\nModel Selection and Performance\nAfter extensive evaluation of numerous local models, Gemma2 (2B) emerged as the\noptimal choice. Despite its compact size, this model consistently demonstrates\nremarkable accuracy, frequently outperforming models 50 times larger — including\nseveral state-of-the-art options like ChatGPT (these large models often being\nvictim of strong bias during training). Gemma’s efficient architecture allows it\nto run effectively on modest hardware configurations, from Raspberry Pis to\nvirtual private servers.\n\nOur commitment to improvement continues as we evaluate new models, making\neffective alternatives available through the script’s CLI menu as they emerge.\nWe're also exploring specialized fine-tuning opportunities for Gemma2:2b to\nfurther optimize its marketplace moderation capabilities, although it remains\nunclear exactly what sort of performance boost that will grant the model, if\nany.\n\nWallet Configuration\nThe script features a simple CLI python-based wallet with coin controlTo operate\neffectively, the moderation script requires two fundamental components: an\nactive Particl node (particld) and a Particl wallet containing coins. Setting up\nyour wallet environment can be accomplished in two ways.\n\nThe first approach utilizes the CLI menu's built-in wallet creation tool, which\nstreamlines the process for new users. Alternatively, if you already maintain a\nParticl wallet, you can integrate it with the script. This process involves\nspecifying your wallet's directory path in the config/config.yaml file and\ninitializing it through the script's settings menu (Settings/Particl Wallet and\nNode Settings/Initialize Wallet).\n\nThe initialization process serves a crucial function beyond basic setup. It\nincorporates the marketplace's key and address into your SMSG database, enabling\nsecure message encryption and decryption. This integration proves essential for\nboth accessing marketplace content and participating in the voting system.\nWithout proper initialization, you won't be able to decrypt marketplace listings\nor cast votes on content.\n\nVote Broadcasting System\nThe process of broadcasting votes to the network follows a structured approach\ndesigned to ensure accuracy and intentionality. When running the script for the\nfirst time with new moderation policies, we recommend a thorough review of the\nLLM's decisions. Access these through the \"Display Processed Listings\" menu,\nwhere you can examine each decision in detail.\n\nDuring this review phase, you maintain full control to modify any automated\ndecisions that don't align with your intentions. This verification step proves\nparticularly valuable when working with new rule sets or in markets with unique\ncontent patterns.\n\nOnce satisfied with the moderation decisions, you can initiate the broadcasting\nprocess through the CLI menu. Remember that this operation requires coins in\nyour wallet, as the weight of each vote is measured by the number of coins\ncontained in that wallet. The script manages these transactions automatically,\nensuring efficient use of your wallet's resources while maintaining the\nintegrity of your voting decisions.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: Can I use this application without running a local model? \nA: Not currently. While we initially explored PetalsLLM, a decentralized GPU\nnetwork running open models, we ultimately decided against including this option\nin the final release. Despite its promising concept, limitations in GPU provider\navailability made consistent uptime impossible. Additionally, the\ncommunity-hosted models didn't meet the specific marketplace moderation\nperformance requirements. While we continue monitoring developments in this\nspace for future alternatives, we've found that gemma2:2b offers an excellent\ncompromise — though it may process content more slowly on smaller devices, its\nminimal resource requirements make it viable even on modest hardware like\nRaspberry Pis, small VMs, and VPS servers.\n\nQ: How is my data and privacy protected? \nA: Privacy protection is fundamental to this script's core design. The script\nconnects exclusively with the marketplace, eliminating third-party data\ncollection risks. We've implemented vote anonymization through decision\nencoding, making it impossible for outside observers to determine which\naddresses cast specific votes. This approach aligns with Particl's core privacy\nand data security principles, which guided the script's development.\n\nQ: What happens if the LLM makes a mistake on a listing? \nA: Given LLMs' deterministic nature, occasional errors may occur. This is why we\nemphasize thorough testing using the provided test listings before deploying new\nmoderation policies. We strongly recommend against using continuous mode until\nyou're fully satisfied with your custom rules' performance. Manual mode provides\nan excellent environment for fine-tuning rules and understanding how the LLM\ninterprets different content types.\n\nQ: Is the script compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux? \nA: Yes. We've designed the app with cross-platform compatibility as a priority.\nBuilt using Python, it runs on any system supporting Python 3.8 or higher. The\ninstallation script creates a dedicated virtual environment and handles all\ndependency management, ensuring the app won't conflict with your system's\nexisting Python packages or other software.\n\nQ: What happens if my device loses power or the script crashes during continuous\nmode? \nA: The script maintains queue files of processed listings and votes, allowing it\nto resume operations seamlessly after any interruption. When restarted, it will\nautomatically scan for any listings it might have missed during the downtime,\nensuring no content goes unprocessed.\n\nQ: How much storage space does the local LLM model require? \nA: The Gemma2 (2B) model requires approximately 1.6GB of storage space. The\nscript's other components, including the Python environment and dependencies,\nneed roughly 500MB. Particl-related files (e.g., blockchain) will require about\n2.5 GB. Therefore, we recommend having at least 6GB of free storage space to\naccommodate the model, script, and temporary files generated during operation.\n\nQ: What are the minimum hardware requirements to run the script effectively? \nA: For basic operation with reasonable performance, we recommend:\n\n * RAM: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended for smoother operation)\n * Storage: 6GB free space\n * Internet connection: Standard broadband for marketplace connectivity\n\nNote: The script might run on lower specifications, but processing speed may be\nsignificantly reduced.\n\nQ: How does the script handle network connectivity issues? \nA: The script easily handles network interruptions. If connection to the\nmarketplace is lost, it will pause operations and attempt to reconnect at\nregular intervals. Any votes queued during this period are safely stored\nlocally. Once connectivity is restored, the script resumes operation and\nprocesses any listings it missed during the downtime.\n\nQ: Can multiple instances of the script run simultaneously on different devices? \nA: Yes, you can run multiple instances across different devices, each with their\nown wallet and rule set. This can be useful for providing redundancy. Each\ninstance operates independently and contributes to the overall voting pool\naccording to its wallet's stake.\n\nQ: How can I backup my moderation rules and configuration? \nA: The app stores all rules, configurations, and listing data in the config\ndirectory. We recommend regularly backing up both the config.yaml file and the\nrules directory. These can be restored on another installation of the script or\nused to recover your setup if needed.\n\nQ: Is there a way to test my rules against historical marketplace data? \nA: No, Particl Marketplace does not keep information about its listings beyond\nthe expiration point of their associated SMSG messages. To test on more listings\nthan what is currently available on the marketplace, please use the provided\ntest listings (available from the CLI menu).\n\nQ: How does the script handle updates to the LLM model? \nA: LLM models are managed by the Ollama protocol, which is installed and\ninitiated as part of the setup process. When new model versions become\navailable, they can be downloaded through the script's menu system (provided\nthat you’ve run `git pull` to update your moderation app in the first place).\n\nLooking Forward\nThe release of this automated moderation script marks a significant milestone in\ndecentralized marketplace technology. It demonstrates that we can achieve\neffective content moderation while staying true to the principles of privacy,\ndecentralization, and user autonomy.\n\nThis development opens up new possibilities for decentralized platforms. It\nshows that we can address complex challenges like content moderation while\nminimizing bias through technological innovation rather than centralized\ncontrol. The script's ability to run locally, its customizable rule system, and\nits privacy-preserving design creates a framework that could benefit other\ndecentralized projects facing similar challenges.\n\nLooking ahead, we're committed to continuing development based on community\nfeedback and technological advances. We're particularly excited about the\npotential for improved local LLM models, community-contributed rule templates,\nand further optimizations such as fine-tuning that could make the script even\nmore efficient and user-friendly.\n\nYour feedback and contributions will be crucial in shaping the future of this\ntool. Whether you're a marketplace vendor, a buyer, or simply interested in\ndecentralized technologies, we encourage you to try the script, experiment with\ndifferent rules, and share your experiences with the community.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

While we initially explored PetalsLLM, a decentralized GPU network running open models, we ultimately decided against including this option in the final release. Despite its promising concept, limitations in GPU provider availability made consistent uptime impossible. Additionally, the community-hosted models didn't meet the specific marketplace moderation performance requirements. While we continue monitoring developments in this space for future alternatives, we've found that gemma2:2b offers an excellent compromise — though it may process content more slowly on smaller devices, its minimal resource requirements make it viable even on modest hardware like Raspberry Pis, small VMs, and VPS servers.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How is my data and privacy protected? <br><strong>A:</strong> Privacy protection is fundamental to this script's core design. The script connects exclusively with the marketplace, eliminating third-party data collection risks. We've implemented vote anonymization through decision encoding, making it impossible for outside observers to determine which addresses cast specific votes. This approach aligns with Particl's core privacy and data security principles, which guided the script's development.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What happens if the LLM makes a mistake on a listing? <br><strong>A:</strong> Given LLMs' deterministic nature, occasional errors may occur. This is why we emphasize thorough testing using the provided test listings before deploying new moderation policies. We strongly recommend against using continuous mode until you're fully satisfied with your custom rules' performance. Manual mode provides an excellent environment for fine-tuning rules and understanding how the LLM interprets different content types.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Is the script compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux? <br><strong>A:</strong> Yes. We've designed the app with cross-platform compatibility as a priority. Built using Python, it runs on any system supporting Python 3.8 or higher. The installation script creates a dedicated virtual environment and handles all dependency management, ensuring the app won't conflict with your system's existing Python packages or other software.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What happens if my device loses power or the script crashes during continuous mode? <br><strong>A:</strong> The script maintains queue files of processed listings and votes, allowing it to resume operations seamlessly after any interruption. When restarted, it will automatically scan for any listings it might have missed during the downtime, ensuring no content goes unprocessed.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How much storage space does the local LLM model require? <br><strong>A: </strong>The Gemma2 (2B) model requires approximately 1.6GB of storage space. The script's other components, including the Python environment and dependencies, need roughly 500MB. Particl-related files (e.g., blockchain) will require about 2.5 GB. Therefore, we recommend having at least 6GB of free storage space to accommodate the model, script, and temporary files generated during operation.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the minimum hardware requirements to run the script effectively? <br><strong>A:</strong> For basic operation with reasonable performance, we recommend:</p><ul><li>RAM: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended for smoother operation)</li><li>Storage: 6GB free space</li><li>Internet connection: Standard broadband for marketplace connectivity</li></ul><p><strong>Note: </strong>The script might run on lower specifications, but processing speed may be significantly reduced.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the script handle network connectivity issues? <br><strong>A:</strong> The script easily handles network interruptions. If connection to the marketplace is lost, it will pause operations and attempt to reconnect at regular intervals. Any votes queued during this period are safely stored locally. Once connectivity is restored, the script resumes operation and processes any listings it missed during the downtime.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can multiple instances of the script run simultaneously on different devices? <br><strong>A:</strong> Yes, you can run multiple instances across different devices, each with their own wallet and rule set. This can be useful for providing redundancy. Each instance operates independently and contributes to the overall voting pool according to its wallet's stake.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How can I backup my moderation rules and configuration? <br><strong>A:</strong> The app stores all rules, configurations, and listing data in the config directory. We recommend regularly backing up both the config.yaml file and the rules directory. These can be restored on another installation of the script or used to recover your setup if needed.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Is there a way to test my rules against historical marketplace data?<strong> </strong><br><strong>A:</strong> No, Particl Marketplace does not keep information about its listings beyond the expiration point of their associated SMSG messages. To test on more listings than what is currently available on the marketplace, please use the provided test listings (available from the CLI menu).</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the script handle updates to the LLM model? <br><strong>A:</strong> LLM models are managed by the Ollama protocol, which is installed and initiated as part of the setup process. When new model versions become available, they can be downloaded through the script's menu system (provided that you’ve run `git pull` to update your moderation app in the first place).</p><h1 id=\"looking-forward\">Looking Forward</h1><p>The release of this automated moderation script marks a significant milestone in decentralized marketplace technology. It demonstrates that we can achieve effective content moderation while staying true to the principles of privacy, decentralization, and user autonomy.</p><p>This development opens up new possibilities for decentralized platforms. It shows that we can address complex challenges like content moderation while minimizing bias through technological innovation rather than centralized control. The script's ability to run locally, its customizable rule system, and its privacy-preserving design creates a framework that could benefit other decentralized projects facing similar challenges.</p><p>Looking ahead, we're committed to continuing development based on community feedback and technological advances. We're particularly excited about the potential for improved local LLM models, community-contributed rule templates, and further optimizations such as fine-tuning that could make the script even more efficient and user-friendly.</p><p>Your feedback and contributions will be crucial in shaping the future of this tool. Whether you're a marketplace vendor, a buyer, or simply interested in decentralized technologies, we encourage you to try the script, experiment with different rules, and share your experiences with the community.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">The Open-Source Revolution</h3><p>We're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital economy that is fair and open to all.

This script combines local LLM technology with Particl's existing moderation framework to create an automated system that maintains our core values of privacy and decentralization while significantly reducing the burden on users.</p><p>Built using Python, this new solution operates entirely on your local device. It analyzes marketplace listings using locally-run, lightweight LLM models, requiring no external API calls or interaction with third-party services. Your data stays on your machine, with the script establishing connections exclusively to Particl Marketplace itself. The application runs on virtually any computing environment — from powerful workstations to modest setups like Raspberry Pis or virtual machines, supporting Windows, MacOS, and Linux operating systems.</p><p><strong>You can access the script and its documentation through our Github repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script\">https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script</a></strong></p><h2 id=\"how-we-got-here-the-current-moderation-system\"><strong>How We Got Here: The Current Moderation System</strong></h2><p>This release builds on top of Particl Marketplace's initial moderation system (v0.1), a decentralized approach that puts moderation control directly in users' hands. This system has served the marketplace well since launch, but as the platform grew, we identified opportunities to improve its efficiency and pro-activity while maintaining its decentralized nature.</p><p>The current system implements a sophisticated voting mechanism that shares some conceptual similarities with Reddit's upvote/downvote system, but with crucial differences that make it suitable for a decentralized environment. When users encounter potentially problematic listings, they can flag them, directly on the application, for community review. These flagged items then appear on a public list where the community can either support the original flag through additional downvotes or contest it with upvotes.</p><p>Content removal follows strict mathematical thresholds rather than arbitrary decisions. A listing is only removed when its negative votes exceed 0.1% of Particl's total coin supply. For example, assuming a total Particl coin supply of 15,000,000 coins, a listing requires a net negative vote weight of 15,000 coins to be removed.</p><p>Importantly, votes aren't calculated on a one-user-one-vote basis. Since Particl's decentralized architecture makes it trivial to create multiple addresses, the system instead weighs votes based on the number of coins in the voting wallet. This prevents gaming the system, as coins can't be fabricated within an address. The more stake you hold, the more influence your vote carries.</p><h2 id=\"addressing-current-limitations\"><strong>Addressing Current Limitations</strong></h2><p>While this system has proven effective at maintaining marketplace standards, its continued usage has highlighted two significant challenges:</p><p>First, the system requires constant attention from active users to maintain effective moderation. This creates an ongoing burden on the community and can lead to inconsistent moderation coverage during periods of lower user activity.</p><p>Second, and more critically, the reactive nature of the system means users must be exposed to potentially undesirable content before they can vote to remove it. While early adopters and technology enthusiasts might accept this as a necessary trade-off to enjoy unapologetic decentralization, it presents a significant barrier to broader adoption, particularly among more mainstream users.</p><p>These challenges demanded a solution that could maintain our commitment to decentralization and privacy while reducing the burden on users and improving the marketplace experience.</p><h2 id=\"the-promise-of-local-llm-technology\"><strong>The Promise of Local LLM Technology</strong></h2><p>The breakthrough came with recent advances in Large Language Model technology. While the spotlight often falls on centralized services like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude, or Google's Gemini, they conflict with Particl's privacy-focused ethos and pose scaling challenges; more listings would mean higher total API costs.</p><p>Indeed, the real innovation for our purposes has been in local and open models. These models can now run effectively on personal devices while achieving accuracy rates comparable to their cloud-based counterparts, all without ever connecting to third-party service providers.</p><p>This technological advancement presented an opportunity to significantly improve Particl Marketplace’s moderation system with context-based analysis without compromising on core principles. While using centralized LLM services through APIs would have conflicted with Particl's privacy-focused ethos and introduced scaling challenges, local models offered a perfect fit for our needs.</p><h1 id=\"the-new-automated-moderation-script\">The New Automated Moderation Script</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">GitHub - cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script: Automated, LLM-powered content moderation script for Particl Marketplace.

The script independently cycles through scanning the marketplace for new listings, analyzing each one, applying moderation decisions, and broadcasting votes to the network. After completing this sequence, it begins anew with another marketplace scan. While this mode significantly improves moderation efficiency and reduces user exposure to undesirable content, we strongly recommend implementing it only after thoroughly testing your rules in manual mode.</p><h3 id=\"rule-system-and-analysis\"><strong>Rule System and Analysis</strong></h3><p>At the heart of this script's moderation process lies a sophisticated rule system powered by local LLM models. These models continuously monitor marketplace activity, evaluating new listings against your predefined criteria. Each rule can trigger one of three actions: downvote, upvote, or ignore, giving you precise control over the moderation process.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6BGhzhwa8wQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"Automated and LLM-powered marketplace content moderation script\"></iframe></figure><p>The system accepts rules in both keyword format and natural language descriptions, offering flexibility in how you define your moderation parameters. To help you get started, we've included a comprehensive set of template rules accessible through the CLI menu. These templates serve dual purposes — providing immediate functionality and demonstrating effective rule construction. You can use them as-is, modify them to better align with your specific needs, or entirely replace them with custom rules of your own.</p><p>For those interested in creating custom rules, we've included a diverse set of test listings spanning various categories — from standard marketplace items to prohibited products and contentious cases designed to put custom rules to the test. This test dataset proves invaluable in evaluating and refining your rules before deploying them in the live marketplace.</p><h3 id=\"the-judgement-engine\"><strong>The Judgement Engine</strong></h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2024/11/image-6.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2024/11/image-6.png 600w, /glink/2024/11/image-6.png 671w\"><figcaption><em>Processed listing browser using example moderation rules (these are entirely user-defined)</em></figcaption></figure><p>The judgement system employs a carefully designed approach to content analysis. The local LLM model examines both listing titles and descriptions, but with an important distinction in its methodology. Rather than using potentially biased terms like 'illegal', 'remove', or ‘unethical’ when classifying, it categorizes listings using neutral terms such as 'true', 'false', or 'ignore'. This neutral framework ensures the model remains flexible and unbiased, capable of handling highly specific custom rules without predetermined assumptions.</p><h3 id=\"model-selection-and-performance\"><strong>Model Selection and Performance</strong></h3><p>After extensive evaluation of numerous local models, Gemma2 (2B) emerged as the optimal choice. Despite its compact size, this model consistently demonstrates remarkable accuracy, frequently outperforming models 50 times larger — including several state-of-the-art options like ChatGPT (these large models often being victim of strong bias during training).

When restarted, it will automatically scan for any listings it might have missed during the downtime, ensuring no content goes unprocessed.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How much storage space does the local LLM model require? <br><strong>A: </strong>The Gemma2 (2B) model requires approximately 1.6GB of storage space. The script's other components, including the Python environment and dependencies, need roughly 500MB. Particl-related files (e.g., blockchain) will require about 2.5 GB. Therefore, we recommend having at least 6GB of free storage space to accommodate the model, script, and temporary files generated during operation.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the minimum hardware requirements to run the script effectively? <br><strong>A:</strong> For basic operation with reasonable performance, we recommend:</p><ul><li>RAM: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended for smoother operation)</li><li>Storage: 6GB free space</li><li>Internet connection: Standard broadband for marketplace connectivity</li></ul><p><strong>Note: </strong>The script might run on lower specifications, but processing speed may be significantly reduced.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the script handle network connectivity issues? <br><strong>A:</strong> The script easily handles network interruptions. If connection to the marketplace is lost, it will pause operations and attempt to reconnect at regular intervals. Any votes queued during this period are safely stored locally. Once connectivity is restored, the script resumes operation and processes any listings it missed during the downtime.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can multiple instances of the script run simultaneously on different devices? <br><strong>A:</strong> Yes, you can run multiple instances across different devices, each with their own wallet and rule set. This can be useful for providing redundancy. Each instance operates independently and contributes to the overall voting pool according to its wallet's stake.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How can I backup my moderation rules and configuration? <br><strong>A:</strong> The app stores all rules, configurations, and listing data in the config directory. We recommend regularly backing up both the config.yaml file and the rules directory. These can be restored on another installation of the script or used to recover your setup if needed.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Is there a way to test my rules against historical marketplace data?<strong> </strong><br><strong>A:</strong> No, Particl Marketplace does not keep information about its listings beyond the expiration point of their associated SMSG messages. To test on more listings than what is currently available on the marketplace, please use the provided test listings (available from the CLI menu).</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the script handle updates to the LLM model? <br><strong>A:</strong> LLM models are managed by the Ollama protocol, which is installed and initiated as part of the setup process. When new model versions become available, they can be downloaded through the script's menu system (provided that you’ve run `git pull` to update your moderation app in the first place).</p><h1 id=\"looking-forward\">Looking Forward</h1><p>The release of this automated moderation script marks a significant milestone in decentralized marketplace technology. It demonstrates that we can achieve effective content moderation while staying true to the principles of privacy, decentralization, and user autonomy.</p><p>This development opens up new possibilities for decentralized platforms. It shows that we can address complex challenges like content moderation while minimizing bias through technological innovation rather than centralized control. The script's ability to run locally, its customizable rule system, and its privacy-preserving design creates a framework that could benefit other decentralized projects facing similar challenges.</p><p>Looking ahead, we're committed to continuing development based on community feedback and technological advances. We're particularly excited about the potential for improved local LLM models, community-contributed rule templates, and further optimizations such as fine-tuning that could make the script even more efficient and user-friendly.</p><p>Your feedback and contributions will be crucial in shaping the future of this tool. Whether you're a marketplace vendor, a buyer, or simply interested in decentralized technologies, we encourage you to try the script, experiment with different rules, and share your experiences with the community.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">The Open-Source Revolution</h3><p>We're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital economy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nAutomated Marketplace Content Moderation ?\nDecentralized Moderation Meets Local AIDiscover the new automated, LLM-powered\nParticl Marketplace moderation script.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-moderation-meets-local-ai/]Earlier today, we\npublished the open-source code for the automated, LLM-powered Particl\nMarketplace content moderation script. \n\nThis helper script, which aims to streamline marketplace moderation by shifting\nthe moderation burden from end-users to more engaged community members (though\nend-users can still participate in content moderate as before), is built using\nPython and is available across Windows, MacOS, and Linux platforms.\n\nFor detailed insights into the system's architecture, check out our latest blog\npost here [https://particl.news/decentralized-moderation-meets-local-ai/]. Ready\nto get started? The setup guide is available in our Github README here\n[https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script/blob/master/README.md]\n.\n\nWe encourage you to try this new proactive moderation approach and share your\nfeedback. We're particularly excited about how this solution bridges two\ntransformative technologies - cryptocurrencies and LLMs - to address the complex\nchallenge of unbiased content moderation in decentralized systems.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week has been a continuation of the work we've mentioned in last week's\nupdate.\n\nBitcoin Cash Integration Update ?\nWe've continued assisting mainnet-pat with his Bitcoin Cash integration into\nBasicSwap, notably focusing on a few edge cases and the \"mercy path\". \n\nYou can keep track of some of the development on that end by monitoring\nTecnovert's fork of BasicSwap (here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commits/bch_staging/]), which serves as\na testing ground for features and updates that will later on make it to the\nofficial BasicSwap repository.\n\nBasicSwap Windows Installer ?‍♂️\nWe have completed the majority of work on the new Windows installer following\nextensive testing this week. However, we haven't been able to release it just\nyet, though we expect it to go live very shortly.\n\nFor context, we've adopted a new approach to the setup wizard that simplifies\nits flow and handles the installation process differently. This redesign aims to\nreduce potential failures that can occur across various Windows configurations.\n\nNew Display Type for Orders ?\nAs part of BasicSwap's current development cycle, we're reimagining the order\nbook display by introducing a new visualization option for available offers.\n\nWhile continuing to source data from the same network offers, the new interface\nwill more closely resemble traditional cryptocurrency exchanges. It will feature\na depth chart and a structured order book that displays both buy and sell offers\nin ascending order on opposite sides.\n\nThis enhancement aims to align BasicSwap's user experience with conventional\ntrading platforms, bridging the gap between atomic swap technology's benefits\nand the accessibility needed to achieve widespread adoption.\n\nParticl and BasicSwap Media ?\nPrivacy Roundtable ?️\nx.comX (formerly Twitter)\n[https://x.com/BasicSwapDEX/status/1855017656576839694]Don't miss our upcoming\nPrivacy Roundtable on X Spaces with our friend from PIVX and Firo this coming\n20th of November at 9:00 AM EST!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

plan to proceed with the\nrelease early next week.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nGeneral ✅\nWe've been looking into a few bugs and issues, notably as we've been\ninvestigating a bug reported by the community.

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est. July, 2025\n * Implementation: Upon successful vote (75% approval rate with minimum quorum\n   of 20% of the total supply over 10,080 blocks) and subsequent hard fork.\n\nImpact\nIf approved, this change will:\n\n * Significantly reduce PART's inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%;\n * Reduce PART’s inflation rate by 0.5% every year until it reaches 1.0%;\n * Remove the network treasury;\n * Initiate a hard fork of the Particl blockchain.\n\nWe believe this proposal represents a positive step toward optimizing the\nParticl network's economic model while ensuring sustainable project development\nand incentivising our community to actively promote and grow the\nnetwork.Important: For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are\nrunning its latest version.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come.
