we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nParticl Marketplace Update ?\nWe've made significant progress on developing the decentralized, LLM-powered\nmoderation tool for the marketplace. Currently, we have two developers assigned\nto the task: one focusing on the LLM component and the other on\nmarketplace-related adjustments.\n\nWe understand that the community has questions about the system's design and\nwhether it will maintain the marketplace's decentralized and private ethos.\nWhile we plan to release an in-depth blog post explaining all details before the\nsystem's launch, we'd like to provide some additional information now.\n\nDecentralized Marketplace Moderation v0.2\nIt's important to understand that the current system will remain in place. Even\nwith upcoming changes, it will still be possible to manually upvote and downvote\nlistings directly in the application.\n\nWhen first released, this system was announced as v0.1, with future iterations\nplanned. Effective moderation of a decentralized system without third-party bias\nis challenging, and what we're working on is essentially v0.2 of that system.\n\nThis new version will use the same downvote/upvote mechanism where listings are\nremoved from the marketplace's interface once they reach a negative threshold,\nbut with more automation, resulting in a much improved user experience.\n\nPro-Active Moderation\nThe updated system will run on staking nodes, and the Partyman cold staking\napplication will likely include a script to guide users through enabling the\nsystem, setting moderation policies and rules, and consulting moderation\nhistory.\n\nWhen enabled, the system will scan the marketplace and extract individual\nlisting titles and descriptions, which will be processed through a decentralized\nLLM network to test against the user's moderation policies.\n\nThis improved version will ensure more effective and proactive marketplace\nmoderation while reducing reliance on manual user interaction.\n\nFrom an end-user perspective, more effective, automated content moderation will\nreduce encounters with undesirable listings before delisting them, benefiting\nmarketplace adoption and directly addressing a theoretical attack vector.\n\nAbsolute Decentralization\nWe've noted concerns about the new system's level of decentralization and\nwhether users will need to create accounts with AI service providers or run\nresource-intensive open-source models locally.\n\nRest assured, our innovative solution requires neither accounts nor local LLM\ninstances. It utilizes a decentralized network of voluntary GPUs collectively\nrunning Llama-based models. Staking nodes will simply send messages to this\ndecentralized LLM network and receive appropriate responses, which will then be\nprocessed by the rest of the moderation system.\n\nIn other words, decentralization and privacy remain intact, with no compromises\ncaused by the new changes.\n\nUpvoting and Downvoting\nOnce a response is received from the LLM network, the node will use the\nassociated wallet's staking weight to upvote, downvote, or ignore the listing.\nThe marketplace will tally votes for each listing, and if the negative threshold\nis reached, it will be removed, as per the current system.\n\nListings can also be upvoted to counterbalance downvotes, and the delisting\nthreshold will be adjusted to account for the expected increased participation\nrate.\n\nUpcoming Blog Post\nWe'll publish a detailed blog post shortly before releasing this new version of\nthe moderation system, including diagrams, in-depth information, and usage\nguides.\n\nWe're confident this new system will improve the user experience by reducing the\nmoderation burden on end users while also improving efficiency.\n\nDisabling of Public Markets and Storefronts\nWe've also noticed concerns regarding a specific commit made in June to Particl\nMarketplace that would disable public markets and storefronts.\n\nThis commit was initially pushed as a proactive measure to prevent potential\nabuse of Particl Marketplace in case we couldn't rapidly improve the moderation\nsystem.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this commit has not yet been included in\nany release and, given our satisfactory progress on the new version of the\nmoderation system, it now appears that implementing it will not be necessary.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core.

Particl Marketplace in preparation for a better,\nmore proactive, yet equally decentralized content moderation system powered by a\ndecentralized LLM system.\n\nThis innovative approach stands at the intersection of blockchain and emerging\nLLM technology, and while it requires additional R&D before finalization, it\nshows great promise. We're confident this new system will significantly improve\nthe current moderation process, improving both its effectiveness but also the\ngeneral user experience.\n\nBefore the new moderation system is fully implemented, you can expect a Particl\nDesktop update featuring the necessary preparatory changes to drop.

That\nmeans you can now swap Decred with all available cryptocurrencies on BasicSwap,\nwhich coincidently marks the completion of its integration within the DEX.\n\nWe'd like to extend our thanks to the Decred community for supporting BasicSwap\ndevelopers with the integration. ?\n\n> Note: We will publish, next week on the Particl News blog, a detailed article\nthat officially announces the completion of the integration as well as in-depth\ninformation about it.\nWownero Integration ? ?️\nThis update also introduces Wownero on the master branch. Similarly to Monero,\nWownero cannot be swapped using regular HTLC (Secret Hash) based swaps, but can\nbe swapped using adaptor signature swaps.\n\nJust like Decred, this update marks the completion of the Wownero integration\ninto BasicSwap. As such, we'd like to extend our thanks to Ofrnxmr for\ncompleting the vast majority of the work that has gone into making this\npossible! ?\n\n> Note: We will publish, next week on the Particl News blog, a detailed article\nthat officially announces the completion of the integration as well as in-depth\ninformation about it.\nParticl and BasicSwap Media ?\nBasicSwap DEX at Monerokon 2024Watch this year’s BasicSwap talk at Monerokon\n2024.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-dex-at-monerokon-2024/]One of BasicSwap's\npresentation at this year's edition of Monerokon has been published by the\norganizers of the conference on their Youtube channel.\n\nSo if you've missed the talk as it was streamed live, or if you want to watch it\nonce more, you can now do so by following the link above or using the embedded\nmedia player below.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

Marketplace Update ?\nAs the full in-depth legal review of Particl, including the current Particl\nMarketplace design and now BasicSwap DEX as well, continues, we're preparing a\nseries of steps to improve Particl's long-term resiliency.\n\nConsequently, most of our desktop development has focused once again on\nwallet-related features, although we've started working on marketplace-related\nchanges once again yesterday.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to

We've now successfully completed both Secret Hash (HTLC) and Adaptor\nSignature (PTLC) atomic swaps, bringing us close to finalizing the integration.\n\nNext steps involve completing the integration of Tor and proper wallet\nencryption for Decred, and then we'll proceed with thorough testing after which\nwe will officially release Decred on the DEX.\n\nHere is the relevant progress report in regards to that specific deliverable:\n\n☑️ Collect Decred chain parameters\n☑️ Encode and decode Decred addresses\n☑️ Call Decred RPC commands\n☑️ Start and manage DCR daemon from BasicSwap\n☑️ Start and manage DCR wallet from BasicSwap\n☑️ Validate Decred seed and wallet restoration\n☑️ Add extkey class to get from seed to account pubkey\n☑️ Add CTransaction class\n☑️ Sign Decred transactions\n☑️ Compute Decred sighash\n☑️ Build CSV tests\n☑️ Build watch-only tests\n☑️ Build gettxout, getProofOfFunds, verifyProofOfFunds \n☑️ Add adaptor signature swap tests\n☑️ Complete a successful secret hash swap (regtest/simnet)\n☑️ Add secret hash swap test ?\n☑️ Complete a successful adaptor signature swap (regtest/simnet) ?\n☑️ Add Decred to test_xmr_persistent ? \n☑️ Add Decred to basicswap-run ?\n☑️ Add Decred to basicswap-prepare setup script ?\n☑️ Start Decred wallet with full functionality into DEX ?\n☑️ Port test_010_txn_size for Decred ?\n☑️ Add Decred wallet to RPC console page and remove CLI option ?\n? Test both swap types on production docker setup (mainnet)\n? Ensure that DCR works with wallet encryption\n? Add Tor support for Decred Wallet\n? Add a series of Decred tests\n\nWork on New Website Continues ✅\nWe've continued work on the new Particl.io [https://particl.io/] website which\nis now the main area of focus for our front-end and designer Crz.\n\nThe purpose of the new website is to simplify and precise the messaging to\nbetter communicate Particl's mission and the goals it set out to achieve.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Marketplace Update ?\nWe have continued, this week, a full in-depth review of the current design of\nParticl Marketplace, to determine its viability within the current context and\nwhether design changes need to be brought to it.\n\nWith this in mind, we will be carrying all considerations made here into the\ndesign of the new marketplace (tentatively being referred to as \"Particl\nMarketplace V2\"), which is being designed as a more open-ended, accessible, and\nuser-friendly iteration. \n\nAs such, we are deferring work on marketplace features as well as the TAILS and\nTor deliverables until after we complete our reassessment.\n\nParticl Desktop Update ?️\nAs we're progressing through the wallet-related improvements planned for Particl\nDesktop, we've pushed, earlier this week, a new Particl Core update to the\ndesktop client.\n\nTo run the new Core version, simply launch Particl Desktop, or restart it if\nit's already running, and the update will automatically start.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by

You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nWe've been working through a series of back-end and general improvements to the\nBasicSwap DEX codebase, some of which having been completed throughout the week,\nas defined in the list below.\n\n☑️ Update Litecoin Core to 0.21.3\n☑️ Fix LTC trying to use MWEB outputs for proof of funds\n☑️ Fix offer rate + get updating send amount\n? Remove protobuf and encode/decode the binary format directly\n? Allow setting wallet file name for multi-wallet coins\n? Work around LTC MWEB spends not detected after import\n\nDecred Integration ✅\nWe're still working on integrating Decred into BasicSwap and have made progress\nthis week. Here is the relevant progress report in regards to that specific\ndeliverable:\n\n☑️ Collect Decred chain parameters\n☑️ Encode and decode Decred addresses\n☑️ Call Decred RPC commands\n☑️ Start and manage DCR daemon from BasicSwap\n☑️ Start and manage DCR wallet from BasicSwap\n☑️ Validate Decred seed and wallet restoration\n☑️ Add extkey class to get from seed to account pubkey\n☑️ Add CTransaction class\n☑️ Sign Decred transactions\n☑️ Compute Decred sighash\n☑️ Build CSV tests\n☑️ Build watch-only tests\n☑️ Build gettxout, getProofOfFunds, verifyProofOfFunds tests\n?

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Update ?️\nThis week has seen only minor progress on Particl Desktop due to our desktop\ndeveloper being mostly unavailable. However, we expect desktop development pace\nto start picking up starting today.\n\n * Update Particl Desktop-related dependencies and modules. (partly completed,\n   focus shifted to items listed below)\n * Diagnose and fix a problem with how market identities behave. (priority)\n * Diagnose and fix an issue with the editing of Seller Templates. (priority)\n * Tie marketplace content moderation voting threshold to circulating supply.\n * Improve proxy connections (better Tor functionality, add i2p, etc).\n * Allow for transactions to be abandoned on PD before they are confirmed.\n * Default display of chat messages to newest message receive.\n\nRemember that, in the interest of pushing updates more quickly and as the array\nof dependency updates are rather time-consuming due to the accrued development\ndebts of the past few months, we may opt to push out Particl Desktop 3.3.3 with\nmost of the updates and fixes mentioned above included, and push a subsequent\nupdate (i.e., 3.3.4) addressing the remaining larger dependency updates.\n\n> Note: Particl Desktop development is currently being worked on on a part-time\nbasis, which is expected to result in slower development pace compared to Core\nor BasicSwap DEX. However, we expect to resume development of this department on\na full-time capacity in the near future.\nParticl Marketplace Moderation ?️\nIn our commitment to maintaining the safety and integrity of Particl\nMarketplace, we've resumed our research into a better, more efficient content\nmoderation system. Those familiar with the project know about the\nalready-existing crowdsourced moderation system which, while functional, is\nstill in its early stages and needs further refinement to effectively minimize\nexposure to undesirable content for the end-user while improving it's\npro-activity.\n\nModerating a decentralized marketplace without introducing central points of\nfailure is a real challenge. On one hand, it cannot put too much responsibility\non end-users, as that means they have to be constantly exposed to undesirable\ncontent so that they can vote it out. But on the other hand, it also cannot put\nthat responsibility into specific users, moderation staff, groups of people, or\norganizations, as that defeats the very purpose of a decentralized system and\nintroduces central points of failure and liability.\n\nOur proposed solution would leverage Particl's staking pools, voting delegation,\nand the potential of LLM (large language models) to more proactively moderate\ncontent. This innovative approach would allow for pre-screening based on\ncommunity-driven policies, removing inappropriate listings before they even\nreach users. The end result is a painless user experience that is free from\nundesirable content and doesn't require the end-user to act as a moderator and\nbe exposed to undesirable content.\n\nKeep in mind that this system is still theoretical, with ongoing research\nfocused on integrating LLM capabilities and refining the implementation strategy\nwithout any sacrifice to the level of decentralization or privacy. Once fully\ndeployed, this model could lead the way in terms of decentralized moderation\nwithout central points of failure or undue burden on users.\n\nWe will continue our research and provide a detailed update on Particl News once\nwe finalize the design. This approach, if successful, could set a precedent for\naddressing moderation challenges in decentralized environments without\nsacrifices to decentralization.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core.

Those familiar with the project know about the already-existing crowdsourced moderation system which, while functional, is still in its early stages and needs further refinement to effectively minimize exposure to undesirable content for the end-user while improving it's pro-activity.</p><p>Moderating a decentralized marketplace without introducing central points of failure is a real challenge. On one hand, it cannot put too much responsibility on end-users, as that means they have to be constantly exposed to undesirable content so that they can vote it out. But on the other hand, it also cannot put that responsibility into specific users, moderation staff, groups of people, or organizations, as that defeats the very purpose of a decentralized system and introduces central points of failure and liability.</p><p>Our proposed solution would leverage Particl's staking pools, voting delegation, and the potential of LLM (large language models) to more proactively moderate content. This innovative approach would allow for pre-screening based on community-driven policies, removing inappropriate listings before they even reach users. The end result is a painless user experience that is free from undesirable content and doesn't require the end-user to act as a moderator and be exposed to undesirable content.</p><p>Keep in mind that this system is still theoretical, with ongoing research focused on integrating LLM capabilities and refining the implementation strategy without any sacrifice to the level of decentralization or privacy. Once fully deployed, this model could lead the way in terms of decentralized moderation without central points of failure or undue burden on users.</p><p>We will continue our research and provide a detailed update on Particl News once we finalize the design. This approach, if successful, could set a precedent for addressing moderation challenges in decentralized environments without sacrifices to decentralization.</p><h2 id=\"particl-core-\">Particl Core ?</h2><h3 id=\"core-codebase-maintenance-\">Core Codebase Maintenance ?️</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Commits · tecnovert/particl-core</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Particl Core integration/staging tree.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Update ?️\nThis week's desktop-related work has been focused on making progress with the\nupdates for Particl Desktop 3.3.3, focusing on the various items contained in\nthe list below.\n\n * Update Particl Desktop-related dependencies and modules. (partly completed,\n   focus shifted to items listed below)\n * Diagnose and fix a problem with how market identities behave. (priority)\n * Diagnose and fix an issue with the editing of Seller Templates. (priority)\n * Tie marketplace content moderation voting threshold to circulating supply.\n * Improve proxy connections (better Tor functionality, add i2p, etc).\n * Allow for transactions to be abandoned on PD before they are confirmed.\n * Default display of chat messages to newest message receive.\n\nRemember that, in the interest of pushing updates more quickly and as the array\nof dependency updates are rather time-consuming due to the accrued development\ndebts of the past few months, we may opt to push out Particl Desktop 3.3.3 with\nmost of the updates and fixes mentioned above included, and push a subsequent\nupdate (i.e., 3.3.4) addressing the remaining larger dependency updates.\n\n> Note: Particl Desktop development is currently being worked on on a part-time\nbasis, which is expected to result in slower development pace compared to Core\nor BasicSwap DEX. However, we expect to resume development of this department on\na full-time capacity in the near future.\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core.

Allow users to select which coins to show prices for on offers page\n? Move v13 from dev to master — not compatible with previous versions\n?

Fix invalid amount error with large values\n\nDecred Integration ✅\nWe've been working on integrating Decred into BasicSwap, making satisfying\nprogress all throughout the week. Here is the relevant progress report in\nregards to that specific deliverable:\n\n☑️ Collect Decred chain parameters\n☑️ Encode and decode Decred addresses\n☑️ Call Decred RPC commands\n☑️ Start and manage DCR daemon from BasicSwap\n☑️ Start and manage DCR wallet from BasicSwap\n?

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Update ?️\nThis week's desktop-related work has been focused on making progress with the\nupdates for Particl Desktop 3.3.3, focusing on the various items contained in\nthe list below.\n\n * Update Particl Desktop-related dependencies and modules. (partly completed,\n   focus shifted to items listed below)\n * Diagnose and fix a problem with how market identities behave. (priority)\n * Diagnose and fix an issue with the editing of Seller Templates. (priority)\n * Tie marketplace content moderation voting threshold to circulating supply.\n * Improve proxy connections (better Tor functionality, add i2p, etc).\n * Allow copy-pasting via right-clicking.\n * Allow for transactions to be abandoned on PD before they are confirmed.\n * Default display of chat messages to newest message receive.\n\nRemember that, in the interest of pushing updates more quickly and as the array\nof dependency updates are rather time-consuming due to the accrued development\ndebts of the past few months, we may opt to push out Particl Desktop 3.3.3 with\nmost of the updates and fixes mentioned above included, and push a subsequent\nupdate (i.e., 3.3.4) addressing the remaining larger dependency updates.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Update ?️\nThis week's desktop-related work has been focused on making progress with the\nupdates for Particl Desktop 3.3.3, this time pivoting towards progressing on the\nvarious feature updates planned for it.\n\nIn the interest of pushing updates more quickly, and as the array of dependency\nupdates are rather time-consuming due to the accrued development debts of the\npast few months, we may opt to push out Particl Desktop 3.3.3 with most of the\nupdates and fixes mentioned above included, and push a subsequent update (i.e.,\n3.3.4) addressing the remaining larger dependency updates.\n\n * Update Particl Desktop-related dependencies and modules. (partly completed,\n   focus shifted to items listed below)\n   \n * Diagnose and fix a problem with how market identities behave. (priority)\n * Diagnose and fix an issue with the editing of Seller Templates. (priority)\n * Tie marketplace content moderation voting threshold to circulating supply.\n * Improve proxy connections (better Tor functionality, add i2p, etc).\n * Allow copy-pasting via right-clicking.\n * Allow for transactions to be abandoned on PD before they are confirmed.\n * Default display of chat messages to newest message receive.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nDecred Coming to BasicSwap DEX ✅\nWe are happy to announce that Decred, a pioneering cryptocurrency in atomic\nswap\ntechnology\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n, will be integrated into BasicSwap in the coming weeks.\n\nIndeed, the Decred community has voted to support the team in coding the\nintegration of Decred into the DEX, ensuring its inclusion and access to all\ncurrent and future features, releases, and related products or services on\nBasicSwap.\n\nConsequently, we've begun work on the integration last weekend.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Update ?️\nThis week's desktop-related work has been focused on making progress with the\nupdates for Particl Desktop 3.3.3, continuing to prioritize updating\ndependencies and addressing reported issues.\n\nWe expect this segment of the Particl Desktop 3.3.3 development to be the most\ntime-consuming, primarily due to the lag in updating dependencies caused by the\nsignificant pause in Particl Desktop development.\n\nOnce the dependency updates and issue resolutions are complete, we will shift\nour focus to the following items and release Particl Desktop 3.3.3 when they are\nwrapped up.\n\n * Update Particl Desktop-related dependencies and modules. (in progress)\n * Diagnose and fix a problem with how market identities behave. (in progress)\n * Diagnose and fix an issue with the editing of Seller Templates. (in progress)\n * Update Particl Core version to the latest.\n * Tie marketplace content moderation voting threshold to circulating supply.\n * Improve proxy connections (better Tor functionality, add i2p, etc).\n * Allow copy-pasting via right-clicking.\n * Allow for transactions to be abandoned on PD before they are confirmed.\n * Default display of chat messages to newest message receive.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nUser Interface  ?️\nWe are close to completing the next user interface update for the BasicSwap DEX\nand plan to push it to the dev branch either by the end of the day or over the\nweekend. \n\nThis particular update introduces changes to both the Wallets page and the\nindividual coin pages, including the addition of QR codes, quality-of-life\nimprovements, and other general changes to the codebase. \n\nNext week, our focus will shift to finalizing the New Offer page, which will\nalso undergo a substantial number of improvements.\n\nAnti-Griefing Protection ?️\nWe've continued the development and testing of an optional anti-griefing\nprotection system to raise security for liquidity providers on the DEX.\n\nWe will continue working on this in the days to come and let you know once the\nfeature is ready to go live with a dedicated blog post that explains the details\nwith more depth.\n\nFor context, from last week's update\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-15-03-2024/]: \n\n> This new feature allows users posting offers to require an additional on-chain\nPART fee from bidders, which is burned, adding a cost to fake/abandoned swaps or\nmalicious activity such as liquidity locking and draining funds through on-chain\nfees required from the offerer.\n\nThis deterrent, while optional and at the discretion of the offerer, is part of\nour broader strategy to progressively implement safeguards against various\npotential abuses over time.\nAllow Multiple Base58 Prefix Bytes ✅\nIn a bid to facilitate the integration of different cryptocurrencies into the\nDEX, we've applied a small update to the codebase which allows for multiple\nbase58 prefix bytes. \n\nThis was a requirement for the integration of Wownero, among other coins, that\nis currently being undertaken by community member ofrnxmr.\n\nParticl x Litecoin MWEB Contest ?\nWin a Physical Lealana Litecoin (Worth ~$1,000)Here’s your chance to win a 2013\nLealana 1 Litecoin physical coin worth nearly $1,000!Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/contest-mweb-on-basicswap/]To celebrate the launch of\nLitecoin MWEB on BasicSwap DEX, we're giving away five (5) 2013 Lealana 1\nLitecoin physical coins, each one valued at nearly $1,000 USD, with only two\ncoins remaining.\n\nFor complete details on how to participate, follow this link\n[https://particl.news/contest-mweb-on-basicswap/] to our contest blog post.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Update ?️\nWe're happy to announce that Particl Desktop developer Arnold Bansemer has\nofficially resumed work on Particl Desktop as of this week.\n\nOver the course of the next few weeks, you can expect many changes to be pushed\nto Particl Desktop, which will culminate into the three major deliverables that\nwe've mentioned last week, namely Particl Desktop 3.3.3, Particl Desktop 3.4,\nand the required changes to make Particl Desktop compatible with the\nhyper-private and secure TAILS OS.\n\nHas work only resumed now, we will have more details on the progress being made\nto the below items next week.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.3.3\nThe most immediate desktop release will focus on minor fixes and items that were\nearmarked for it when development paused a few months ago.\n\n * Update Particl Core version to the latest.\n * Update Particl Desktop-related dependencies and modules.\n * Tie marketplace content moderation voting threshold to circulating supply.\n * Improve proxy connections (better Tor functionality, add i2p, etc).\n * Allow copy-pasting via right-clicking.\n * Allow for transactions to be abandonned on PD before they are confirmed.\n * Default display of chat messages to newest message receive.\n * Investigate a potential problem with market identities and fix if issue is\n   found.\n * Investigate a potential issue with the editing functionality for Seller\n   Templates.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.4\nThe subsequent release will be almost exclusively focused on marketplace-related\nbug fixes and improvements. The goal with this update is to get the marketplace\nto a satisfactory level of stability and usability while we transition towards\nbuilding the new marketplace dApp.\n\n * Export Seller Templates to .csv file to easily migrate listings.\n * Allow for batch editing of listing details (i.e., shipping costs).\n * Improve publishing process of listings across different markets/identities.\n * Add an overriding functionality to the batch publish window.\n * Automate batch publishing (retries until all listings are successfully\n   published).\n * Add additional shipping options.\n * Allow Seller Templates to be sorted based on their attributes.\n * Increase character limit to listing description and titles.\n * Allow seller to delete or hide Seller Templates that aren't needed anymore.\n * Enable .jpg, .jpeg, and .png image files.\n\nParticl Desktop for TAILS OS\nAdditionally, we're exploring the requirements to make Particl Desktop\ncompatible with the hyper-private and amnesic TAILS Linux OS. While we have no\nspecific deliverables to announce regarding this, it seems likely that this will\nrequire a specific TAILS-focused version of Particl Desktop as it requires files\nto be managed differently so that it can work in conjunction with persistent\nmemory (i.e., storing required data like orders, Seller Templates, or the\nblockchain on a USB stick) more easily.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nThis week took a bigger than usual chunk of our Core developer's time, with\nlarger and more intricate updates being applied to the code. \n\n * Enable the new GetAntiDoSWorkThreshold check where new blocks with lower\n   difficulty than a block 1440 blocks ago are ignored.\n * Disable \"Make Blank Wallet\" option in Particl-qt.\n * Convert PermittedDifficultyTransition, which disallows a block if its\n   difficulty is higher than a set amount than the difficulty of the last block.\n * Split off the v27 branch in preparation for Particl Core 27.x releases.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nDue to the time-consuming core updates that have been worked on this week, our\ncode developer has had less time to dedicate to BasicSwap, which has resulted in\nno code updates being pushed this week.\n\nUser Interface (GUI 2.1)  ?️\nWe've successfully completed testing on recent UI enhancements and have moved\nthem from the dev branch to the master branch, including some changes that were\ndirectly pushed to master. \n\nThese updates are live and you can now upgrade your BasicSwap instance to access\nthese new changes.\n\nIn addition to these updates, we've made progress on revamping various pages and\ntemplates, notably the \"Wallets\" page, which now includes QR code functionality,\nand improvements to the \"New Offer\" page among others.\n\nExpect code to be pushed to the dev branch very soon!\n\nParticl x Litecoin MWEB Contest ?\nWin a Physical Lealana Litecoin (Worth ~$1,000)Here’s your chance to win a 2013\nLealana 1 Litecoin physical coin worth nearly $1,000!Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/contest-mweb-on-basicswap/]To celebrate the launch of\nLitecoin MWEB on BasicSwap DEX, we're giving away five (5) 2013 Lealana 1\nLitecoin physical coins, each one valued at nearly $1,000 USD, in a new contest\nthat starts today.\n\nFor complete details on how to participate, follow this link\n[https://particl.news/contest-mweb-on-basicswap/] to our contest blog post.

Desktop Update ?️\nWe announced that Particl Desktop development would resume shortly, and those\nplans are still on track for the 2 weeks approximation we gave last week. Today,\nwe're happy to share some of the deliverables we're exploring for the upcoming\nParticl Desktop releases.\n\n> Note: The items listed below are not set in stone. Some may be taken out and new\nitems may appear as we work on the upcoming releases.\nParticl Desktop 3.3.3\nThe most immediate desktop release will focus on minor fixes and items that were\nearmarked for it when development paused a few months ago.\n\n * Update Particl Core version to the latest.\n * Update Particl Desktop-related dependencies and modules.\n * Tie marketplace content moderation voting threshold to circulating supply.\n * Improve proxy connections (better Tor functionality, add i2p, etc).\n * Allow copy-pasting via right-clicking.\n * Allow for transactions to be abandonned on PD before they are confirmed.\n * Default display of chat messages to newest message receive.\n * Investigate a potential problem with market identities and fix if issue is\n   found.\n * Investigate a potential issue with the editing functionality for Seller\n   Templates.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.4\nThe subsequent release will be almost exclusively focused on marketplace-related\nbug fixes and improvements. The goal with this update is to get the marketplace\nto a satisfactory level of stability and usability while we transition towards\nbuilding the new marketplace dApp.\n\n * Export Seller Templates to .csv file to easily migrate listings.\n * Allow for batch editing of listing details (i.e., shipping costs).\n * Improve publishing process of listings across different markets/identities.\n * Add an overriding functionality to the batch publish window.\n * Automate batch publishing (retries until all listings are successfully\n   published).\n * Add additional shipping options.\n * Allow Seller Templates to be sorted based on their attributes.\n * Increase character limit to listing description and titles.\n * Allow seller to delete or hide Seller Templates that aren't needed anymore.\n * Enable .jpg, .jpeg, and .png image files.\n\nParticl Desktop for TAILS OS\nAdditionally, we're exploring the requirements to make Particl Desktop\ncompatible with the hyper-private and amnesic TAILS Linux OS. While we have no\nspecific deliverables to announce regarding this, it seems likely that this will\nrequire a specific TAILS-focused version of Particl Desktop as it requires files\nto be managed differently so that it can work in conjunction with persistent\nmemory (i.e., storing required data like orders, Seller Templates, or the\nblockchain on a USB stick) more easily.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nWe've continued working on improving the BasicSwap codebase with the invaluable\nhelp of our beloved open-source contributors. Here's a part of what we've worked\non this week:\n\n * Provide an alternative to secp256k1_clz64_var using HAVE_BUILTIN_CLZLL.\n * Add support for Bitcoin descriptor wallets.\n * Set the createoffers.py script's min_swap_amount variable to offer min bid\n   amount also (currently only used for bids).\n * Allow multiple signing keys to be tried with the basicswap-prepare script.\n * Set the state of expired bids to \"timed-out\".\n * \"Accept bid\" should be removed — like the \"abandon bid\" button — when not\n   it's not possible to accept (e.g., expired bid).\n\nUser Interface ?️\nThis week again, we've rolled out user interface updates to the dev branch which\nyou can now test.\n\nIf you would like to test these changes before they make it into the master \nbranch, you can change your active BasicSwap branch to the dev branch (using git\ncheckout dev) and updating BasicSwap\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html] \nas you would typically do for a regular update.\n\nNotably, we've pushed changes to the way the order book is displayed that\nsimplify and make it more intuitive. More GUI updates coming next week!\n\nParticl x Litecoin MWEB Contest ?\nWin a Physical Lealana Litecoin (Worth ~$1,000)Here’s your chance to win a 2013\nLealana 1 Litecoin physical coin worth nearly $1,000!Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/contest-mweb-on-basicswap/]To celebrate the launch of\nLitecoin MWEB on BasicSwap DEX, we're giving away five (5) 2013 Lealana 1\nLitecoin physical coins, each one valued at nearly $1,000 USD, in a new contest\nthat starts today.\n\nFor complete details on how to participate, follow this link\n[https://particl.news/contest-mweb-on-basicswap/] to our contest blog post.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Update ?️\nWe're excited to share an exciting update regarding Particl Desktop. We've\nfinally been able to address the issue that has delayed its development recently\nand we're on track to resume work on Particl Desktop 3.x in approximately two\nweeks. \n\nOnce it starts up once gain, we'll work towards completing the V3 desktop\ndevelopment cycle, and then, jump right into the next phase which will be more\nheavily focused on marketplace development (more information about the new\nmarketplace dApp coming shortly).\n\nUntil then, our immediate desktop-related focus will include releasing versions\n3.3.3 and 3.4. Version 3.3.3 will tackle urgent bug fixes and improvements,\nwhile version 3.4 will be dedicated almost solely on refining the marketplace\nfollowing some of our vendors' feedback. Next week, we'll outline the specific\nfixes and improvements planned for these updates.\n\nWe're thrilled to resume progress on Particl Desktop and look forward to\nconcluding its V3 development stage, allowing us to finally transition towards\nthe next significant project milestones.\n\nUpcoming Roadmap ?️\nIn conjunction with work on Particl Desktop resuming, we've crafted a roadmap a\nfew weeks ago outlining the project's upcoming milestones post-V3. While we're\nalready adhering to this roadmap internally and are more than eager to share it\nwith the community, we must await a specific trigger before we do. \n\nThis has unfortunately pushed back our announcement schedule slightly, but we\nanticipate sharing it with you soon. As such, its announcement has no current\nETA.\n\nThank you for your patience and support as we gear up for this thrilling next\nphase of the project.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core.

This is in preparation for the introduction of i2p\nas a new connectivity option within Particl Desktop, a feature that has long\nbeen requested by some in the community.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nWe've continued working on improving the BasicSwap codebase with the invaluable\nhelp of our beloved open-source contributors.

are observing a delay that is impacting the development\nprocess of Particl Desktop which we are working on resolving.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits ·

on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nWe've continued working on improving the BasicSwap codebase with the invaluable\nhelp of our beloved open-source contributors. Here's a list of what we worked on\nthis week:\n\n * Expired bids to automatically transition to a \"Timed-Out\" status. \n * The option to \"Accept Bid\" should be hidden — similar to the \"Abandon Bid\"\n   button — when it is not possible to accept. \n * Integrate the automated market making script into BasicSwap's GUI and add the\n   ability to create Automation Strategies. \n * Improve the user interface for interacting with the automated market making\n   script and editing Automation Strategies. \n * Upgraded to the latest Firo core version. \n * Build a plugin for Hummingbot (to-do/research). \n * Ensure that remote_daemon_urls is displayed in settings when \n   automatically_select_daemon is enabled. \n * Correct the issue where automatic selection of XMR nodes defaults to using\n   the last RPC host/port. \n * Implement \"order stacking\" to aggregate offers of identical value on the\n   order book, thus improving the clarity and efficiency of the way offers are\n   displayed.\n\nNew Firo Core Update ?\nWe've pushed Firo's latest core update on BasicSwap, meaning that you can now\nupdate its core and run the latest version. Just like with Particl Core updates,\nwe always recommend running the most up-to-date version of any coin enabled on\nBasicSwap DEX.\n\nTo update Firo, refer to this Particl Academy guide\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html]\n, or if you're on Linux, use this upgrade script (bsx-upgradecoins)\n[https://github.com/nahuhh/basicswap-bash/releases] built by community member\nofrnxmr.\n\nUser Interface (GUI 2.1)  ?️\nWith the recent surge in community contributions, we've decided to shift towards\na more proactive release strategy for GUI updates. From now on, we plan to roll\nout smaller, more frequent updates on a weekly basis which should go a long way\ntowards better accommodating community feedback and contributions\n\nAs such, we're now getting the first weekly release ready and will be pushing it\nout this coming Monday. \n\nIf you would like to contribute to BasicSwap DEX or provide feedback, comments,\nand ideas, then please join the BasicSwap channel on either Matrix\n[https://matrix.to/#/#basicswap:matrix.org], Discord\n[https://discord.me/particl], or Telegram [https://t.me/basicswapdex].\n\nParticl x Litecoin MWEB Contest ?\nWin a Physical Lealana Litecoin (Worth ~$1,000)Here’s your chance to win a 2013\nLealana 1 Litecoin physical coin worth nearly $1,000!Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/contest-mweb-on-basicswap/]To celebrate the launch of\nLitecoin MWEB on BasicSwap DEX, we're giving away five (5) 2013 Lealana 1\nLitecoin physical coins, each one valued at nearly $1,000 USD, in a new contest\nthat starts today.\n\nFor complete details on how to participate, follow this link\n[https://particl.news/contest-mweb-on-basicswap/] to our contest blog post.
