This development update will explain in more details what is being\nworked into Particl Copay and what can be expected from the next few versions of\nParticl’s mobile application.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMobile Cold Staking\nOne of the big feature being coded into Particl Copay is the long-awaited cold\nstaking capabilities. In fact, it will soon be possible to connect your funds to\na cold staking node directly from your mobile application and help secure the\nnetwork while growing your PART stash at the same time. Note that, in this case,\nthe Particl Copay mobile wallet won’t be the device actually staking. The update\nwill only enable the possibility to cold stake your funds held on Particl Copay\nby delegating its staking power to a cold staking node.\n\nMulti-Signature Cold Staking\nWhat if Particl’s Proof-of-Stake algorithm could be taken yet to another level?\nThis is what this next feature is going to do! Not only will Particl Copay’s\ncold staking update introduce the ability to connect your mobile wallet to a\ncold staking node, but it will also introduce multi-signature\n[https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/3718/what-are-multi-signature-transactions] \ncold staking. This will allow you to stake your funds held in multi-sig\naddresses, requiring you to have access to more than one device to successfully\nauthorize and execute a transaction.\n\nFor the time being, this will only be compatible with Copay devices. This may or\nmay not change in the future, although the team has already identified ways to\nmake it compatible with Ledger hardware devices. As this feature requires a\nhardfork, it won’t be included in the next update of Particl Copay.\n\niOS Support\nAnother long-awaited feature for Particl’s mobile wallet is official support for\niOS. As many of you know, especially iPhone users, Particl Copay hasn’t been\navailable on iOS since its inception, but that’s about to change! The mobile\napplication has already started to see its code being upgraded\n[https://github.com/particl/copay/commits/master] to be compatible with iOS and,\nat that point, we are only waiting for Apple to confirm Particl’s Apple\nDeveloper Account. When that’s done, we’ll be able to publish the application on\nthe App Store whenever the update is ready to go live! This compatibility update\nshould be available in the next version of Particl Copay.\n\nMulti-Currency Support\nA very useful feature that’s gonna be included in the next update is the ability\nto hold different coins in Particl Copay without having to use multiple wallet\napplications. Indeed, once the update goes live, Particl Copay will have support\nfor Particl, but also Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. This should prove very useful\nwhenever Particl’s Open Marketplace starts accepting Bitcoin payments! This\nupdate will be available in the next version of Particl Copay.\n\nUI/UX Improvement\nThose of you already using Particl Copay will notice it right away, this update\nwill introduce several UI/UX improvements all over the app. There is not much to\nsay about this in particular other than the fact that the mobile application has\nbeen improved visually and will offer all of its new features within a very\nuser-friendly and intuitive environment. This update will be available in the\nnext version of Particl Copay.\n\nNotifications\nVarious types of notifications will also be introduced in this update. Whether\nit be incoming or outgoing transactions, staking rewards, or multi-sig\ntransaction requests, the mobile app will now notify you whenever something\nhappens within the app. This update will be available in the next version of\nParticl Copay.\n\nCopay Wallet Emptying Vulnerability Fix\nWhile the current version of Particl Copay isn’t affected by the newly\ndiscovered exploit\n[https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitpays-copay-wallet-compromised-by-malicious-code-firm-issues-advice-for-users] \nthat allowed attackers to empty Bitcoin Copay wallets due to a faulty Node.js\nmodule, this exploit has been revealed to be effective on recent versions of\nBitcoin Copay. This critical vulnerability will be fixed and not be present in\nthe new Particl Copay version.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe hope that you are as excited as we are about this new Particl Copay update.\nThis will bring much needed and requested features to the mobile application and\nreally make this wallet a powerful tool both in terms of utility and security.\nSince this is just a development update and not a proper announcement blog post,\nwe recommend you to watch the developments being made to the mobile application\nby going on its Github repository [http://github.com/particl/copay], or to\nsimply keep an eye on our blog [http://particl.news] for any future release\nannouncement.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant to see more development updates?

In\nfact, they often fare worse than traditional fiat currencies in preserving\nfinancial confidentiality. Indeed, fiat systems typically handle fund transfers\nthrough secured channels designed to safeguard users' financial data from\nunauthorized public exposure.\n\nIn stark contrast, all Bitcoin transactions are permanently recorded on a public\nledger, openly exposing the entirety of one's financial details to any curious\nobserver. While Bitcoin's pseudonymous nature may foster a sense of anonymity in\nlimited contexts, this perception is increasingly recognized as a dangerous\nillusion.\n\nIn fact, transaction tracing capabilities have advanced significantly in the\npast few years, driven in part by regulatory requirements like\nKnow-Your-Customer (KYC) compliance that have necessitated increased transaction\nmonitoring by financial services.\n\nHistorically, only regulatory bodies and financial institutions had access to\ndetailed reports of users' on-chain financial histories through partnerships\nwith blockchain analytics firms however, the ability to effectively deanonymize\ntransactions and map them to real-world identities is rapidly proliferating to\nnew actors — most concerningly, criminals, hackers, and other malicious entities\nintent on exploiting this data for financial gain at the expense of unsuspecting\nvictims — thanks to the rapid evolution of large language models and artificial\nintelligence that have spawned widely accessible tracing protocols.\n\nThese escalating privacy vulnerabilities underscore the paramount importance of\ndeveloping robust privacy-preserving solutions for cryptocurrencies across the\nglobe, such as, among others, ”privacy coins”. Maintaining financial\nconfidentiality is not merely a luxury but an essential capability to safeguard\nusers operating in these systems.\n\nBitcoin and eCommerce\nHowever, when it comes to decentralized commerce – the logical evolution beyond\ndecentralized currencies – merely utilizing privacy coins is not sufficient.\nWhile on-chain transactions may be inherently private, the platforms\nfacilitating purchases and sales represent another significant attack vector\nthat must be addressed.\n\nAs regulatory obligations evolve, businesses operating centralized\ncryptocurrency platforms may be compelled to collect extensive user information,\nincluding transaction histories, associated identities, IP addresses, shipping\ndetails from buyers, sales data from sellers, and more. While one could\nreasonably expect regulatory bodies to handle such information responsibly, the\nsame assurances cannot be extended to the platforms themselves, as highlighted\nin our previous articles on the imperatives of privacy here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/] \nand here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-the-need-to-own-your-data-19bc31b0ec74/]\n.\n\nBut even if all platforms always acted in good faith, this centralized\naggregation of sensitive data becomes an enticing target for hackers and other\nmalicious actors seeking to exploit personal and financial information for\nillicit gains.\n\nThe Inherent Safety Risks of DeCommerce\nThe logical solution, therefore, is to develop an eCommerce platform that is as\ndecentralized as cryptocurrencies themselves. Such a platform would operate in a\npurely peer-to-peer manner, built upon a truly decentralized architecture devoid\nof single points of failure or centralized components. The objective is to offer\nservices akin to centralized eCommerce giants like eBay or Amazon, but without\nany central entity, thus eliminating the associated costs, fees, and frictions\ninherent to intermediaries. A \"decentralized online marketplace\", embodying\nBitcoin's ethos, and providing a clear user experience improvement over\ncentralized counterparts without data collection.\n\nHowever, while recent advancements in blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies\nenable such decentralized eCommerce platforms, they also introduce new\nchallenges in preserving users' financial data privacy and safety.\n\nPicture this scenario: You open a decentralized marketplace, hoping to purchase\na new computer online. You browse available listings from sellers worldwide and\nfind a suitable item. You proceed to add it to your cart and checkout, providing\nthe seller with your shipping address. Herein lies a significant safety concern;\nif you've paid using pseudonymous cryptocurrencies, you've likely revealed your\nphysical location alongside your entire financial history, including balances\nand past transactions.\n\nIn most cases, such disclosures may be innocuous, however, over an extended\nperiod, you or someone else may inadvertently expose critical details to\nmalicious actors, which could be used to identify and target the potential\nvictim. This risk vector is particularly concerning for high net-worth\nindividuals, as every purchase they make could effectively paint a target on\ntheir backs, making this situation simply unsustainable.\n\nCentralized platforms like eBay or Amazon typically circumvent this issue, as\npayments are facilitated through highly regulated centralized providers like\nPayPal, among others. While these entities face valid criticisms, they at least\navoid exposing users' complete financial histories on pseudonymous ledgers.\n\nHowever, a decentralized platform, by its very nature, does not rely on payment\nprocessors. Instead, it enables direct peer-to-peer trade between buyers and\nsellers. Consequently, an alternative solution must be implemented to preserve\nusers' financial privacy and security.\n\nThe Need for Privacy in DeCommerce\nParticl Marketplace addresses these concerns with its decentralized and secure\nonline marketplace, often touted as a privacy-first eCommerce solution. It\nensures user safety by providing robust privacy safeguards in two critical\nareas.\n\nTransactional Privacy\nFirst, it facilitates complete transactional privacy for counterparties through\nthe use of PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, which integrates advanced\non-chain privacy protocols. Two specific protocols are instrumental in\npreserving financial confidentiality: Confidential Transactions (\"CT\") and ring\nsignatures (\"RingCT\").\n\nCT transactions conceal the transfer amounts between parties, while RingCT\nobfuscates both transaction amounts and participant identities. However, RingCT\ntransactions lack programmable outputs, rendering them incompatible with\ndecentralized applications like Particl Marketplace. To address this limitation,\nRingCT inputs can be mapped to CT outputs, which possess programmable\ncapabilities. By chaining these protocols, Particl Marketplace effectively\nharnesses RingCT's enhanced privacy while facilitating seamless integration,\nproviding users with safety — which is otherwise entirely absent without\ntransactional privacy — and the assurance that their financial data remains\nconfidential during transactions.\n\nData-free Marketplace Activity\nSecondly, Particl Marketplace addresses the concerns surrounding excessive data\ncollection practices by centralized eCommerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, and\nEtsy, which have faced criticism for undermining user privacy. Some platforms\nhave even exploited user data to directly compete with their own sellers, as\nexemplified by AmazonBasics products and other Amazon sub-brands – an issue we\nhave previously explored in depth here\n[https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/].\n\nMoreover, while platforms claim to harvest data to enhance user experiences,\ntracking shopping habits can inadvertently expose sensitive information without\nconsent. A notable example is the Target pregnancy prediction case, in which an\nunsuspecting father learned of his daughter's pregnancy due to ad targeting – a\nscenario we’ve also previously discussed here\n[https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/].\n\nTo safeguard against such privacy infringements and data misuse, Particl\nMarketplace is designed to eliminate data generation, collection, storage, or\ndistribution entirely – encompassing both financial and non-financial metadata.\nAll marketplace activity data is stored locally, and all data transmitted (such\nas buyer-seller communications or shipping details) is conveyed through\nend-to-end encrypted messages via SMSG, a peer-to-peer data and messaging\nplatform (\"mixnet\") operating alongside Particl Core nodes\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/].\n\nThis privacy-first architecture ensures user safety and guarantees complete data\nownership and control, while preventing malicious data extraction through hacks,\nexploits, or the simple act of buying or selling online.\n\nConclusion\nWhile various accessibility, usability, and user-experience improvements are\nstill needed, the end result is a decentralized online marketplace that\neliminates fees and associated frictions inherent to third-party intermediaries\nwithin the eCommerce domain.\n\nHowever, beyond these benefits, it primarily serves as a secure platform for\ncryptocurrency users to engage in direct peer-to-peer trade without compromising\ntheir safety by exposing financial information to potentially malicious\nstrangers.\n\nAs we have aimed to clarify with this blog post, privacy in the context of\ncryptocurrency usage transcends a luxury or edge case. In scenarios such as\neCommerce/deCommerce, it is an absolute necessity to ensure the safety and\nwell-being of users transacting with unknown counterparties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

Such a platform would operate in a purely peer-to-peer manner, built upon a truly decentralized architecture devoid of single points of failure or centralized components. The objective is to offer services akin to centralized eCommerce giants like eBay or Amazon, but without any central entity, thus eliminating the associated costs, fees, and frictions inherent to intermediaries. A \"decentralized online marketplace\", embodying Bitcoin's ethos, and providing a clear user experience improvement over centralized counterparts without data collection.</p><p>However, while recent advancements in blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies enable such decentralized eCommerce platforms, they also introduce new challenges in preserving users' financial data privacy and safety.</p><p>Picture this scenario: You open a decentralized marketplace, hoping to purchase a new computer online. You browse available listings from sellers worldwide and find a suitable item. You proceed to add it to your cart and checkout, providing the seller with your shipping address. Herein lies a significant safety concern; if you've paid using pseudonymous cryptocurrencies, you've likely revealed your physical location alongside your entire financial history, including balances and past transactions.</p><p>In most cases, such disclosures may be innocuous, however, over an extended period, you or someone else may inadvertently expose critical details to malicious actors, which could be used to identify and target the potential victim. This risk vector is particularly concerning for high net-worth individuals, as every purchase they make could effectively paint a target on their backs, making this situation simply unsustainable.</p><p>Centralized platforms like eBay or Amazon typically circumvent this issue, as payments are facilitated through highly regulated centralized providers like PayPal, among others. While these entities face valid criticisms, they at least avoid exposing users' complete financial histories on pseudonymous ledgers.</p><p>However, a decentralized platform, by its very nature, does not rely on payment processors. Instead, it enables direct peer-to-peer trade between buyers and sellers. Consequently, an alternative solution must be implemented to preserve users' financial privacy and security.</p><h1 id=\"the-need-for-privacy-in-decommerce\">The Need for Privacy in DeCommerce</h1><p>Particl Marketplace addresses these concerns with its decentralized and secure online marketplace, often touted as a privacy-first eCommerce solution. It ensures user safety by providing robust privacy safeguards in two critical areas.</p><h2 id=\"transactional-privacy\">Transactional Privacy</h2><p>First, it facilitates complete transactional privacy for counterparties through the use of PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, which integrates advanced on-chain privacy protocols. Two specific protocols are instrumental in preserving financial confidentiality: Confidential Transactions (\"CT\") and ring signatures (\"RingCT\").</p><p>CT transactions conceal the transfer amounts between parties, while RingCT obfuscates both transaction amounts and participant identities. However, RingCT transactions lack programmable outputs, rendering them incompatible with decentralized applications like Particl Marketplace. To address this limitation, RingCT inputs can be mapped to CT outputs, which possess programmable capabilities. By chaining these protocols, Particl Marketplace effectively harnesses RingCT's enhanced privacy while facilitating seamless integration, providing users with safety — which is otherwise entirely absent without transactional privacy — and the assurance that their financial data remains confidential during transactions.</p><h2 id=\"data-free-marketplace-activity\">Data-free Marketplace Activity</h2><p>Secondly, Particl Marketplace addresses the concerns surrounding excessive data collection practices by centralized eCommerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, and Etsy, which have faced criticism for undermining user privacy. Some platforms have even exploited user data to directly compete with their own sellers, as exemplified by AmazonBasics products and other Amazon sub-brands – an issue we have previously explored in depth <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/\">here</a></strong>.</p><p>Moreover, while platforms claim to harvest data to enhance user experiences, tracking shopping habits can inadvertently expose sensitive information without consent. A notable example is the Target pregnancy prediction case, in which an unsuspecting father learned of his daughter's pregnancy due to ad targeting – a scenario we’ve also previously discussed <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/\">here</a></strong>.</p><p>To safeguard against such privacy infringements and data misuse, Particl Marketplace is designed to eliminate data generation, collection, storage, or distribution entirely – encompassing both financial and non-financial metadata. All marketplace activity data is stored locally, and all data transmitted (such as buyer-seller communications or shipping details) is conveyed through end-to-end encrypted messages via SMSG, <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\">a peer-to-peer data and messaging platform (\"mixnet\") operating alongside Particl Core nodes</a>.</p><p>This privacy-first architecture ensures user safety and guarantees complete data ownership and control, while preventing malicious data extraction through hacks, exploits, or the simple act of buying or selling online.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>While various accessibility, usability, and user-experience improvements are still needed, the end result is a decentralized online marketplace that eliminates fees and associated frictions inherent to third-party intermediaries within the eCommerce domain.</p><p>However, beyond these benefits, it primarily serves as a secure platform for cryptocurrency users to engage in direct peer-to-peer trade without compromising their safety by exposing financial information to potentially malicious strangers.</p><p>As we have aimed to clarify with this blog post, privacy in the context of cryptocurrency usage transcends a luxury or edge case. In scenarios such as eCommerce/deCommerce, it is an absolute necessity to ensure the safety and well-being of users transacting with unknown counterparties.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">The Open-Source Revolution</h3><p>We're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital economy that is fair and open to all.

for seamless and\npractical decentralized commerce solutions remains a driving force. Although\nthis is a self-evident use case for crypto, comprehensive solutions to use\ndecentralized money as money, without relying on heavily centralized\narchitecture, is lacking.\n\nWhile achieving this goal has proven challenging, this article explores how\nintegrating BasicSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) that offers Litecoin\npairs, into Particl Marketplace, a decentralized e-commerce platform, offers a\nsolution to overcome many user experience obstacles that have come to hinder the\nevolution of cryptocurrencies as a medium of payment.\n\nBy providing multi-currency support\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-integration-unlocking-currency-agnostic-commerce-on-particl/] \nto the decentralized e-commerce ecosystem, this upcoming integration offers a\ntangible path forward for many coins, unlocking the potential for widespread\ncryptocurrency usage in everyday retail transactions.\n\nWith this in mind, Litecoin, with its focused push as a payment currency, serves\nas the perfect candidate to illustrate this transformative potential, allowing\nanyone to use Litecoin for shopping.\n\nLitecoin; Faster and Cheaper Transactions\nLitecoin has garnered significant attention for its faster transaction times and\nlower fees compared to Bitcoin – a stark contrast to the latter's reputation for\nsluggish and costly processing. This, from the beginning, has positioned\nLitecoin as an ideal cryptocurrency for payments and commerce. Recognizing its\nstrengths in speed and affordability, the Litecoin community has been actively\npromoting its adoption as a practical and viable payment solution for years now.\n\nLitecoin MWEB and Privacy: Solidifying Litecoin as True Digital Cash\nLitecoin's MWEB (MimbleWimble Extension Blocks) introduces a significant\nimprovement to an already payment-friendly digital currency: transactional\nprivacy. This brings confidential transactions and privacy features to the\nLitecoin network, a pivotal development poised to solidify its positioning as\ntrue digital cash and a viable currency for payments.\n\nPrivacy is, of course, a crucial aspect in the realm of digital payments, as it\nsafeguards users' and businesses' financial information and promotes fungibility\n– a fundamental characteristic of sound money.\n\nParticl Marketplace: Redefining Decentralized E-Commerce\nWhile transactional privacy is paramount, it is also crucial for the platform\nfacilitating such payments to uphold privacy as well.\n\nEnvision this scenario: you send a private payment using Litecoin MWEB or even\nMonero to purchase an item online. However, you later discover that this\nplatform has been collecting user data and subsequently fell victim to a data\nbreach, exposing your shipping information, shopping history, along with\naddresses and payment details to an attacker. An absolute nightmare, even if the\ninitial payment was conducted through a private transaction.\n\nThis underscores the fact that private payments alone are insufficient to\ncompletely safeguard your shopping habits and selling history. This fact stands\nas a premise for the design of Particl Marketplace.\n\nParticl Marketplace is a decentralized, privacy-focused e-commerce platform\nbuilt using blockchain and peer-to-peer technology. Unlike traditional\ne-commerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, Etsy, or Alibaba, Particl Marketplace\noperates without intermediaries, ensuring secure and private transactions\nbetween users, free from fees or restrictions. Buyers and sellers transact\ndirectly, benefiting from a two-party escrow system that protects both parties\nand keeps all trade information private to the involved parties only.\n\nUsing Litecoin for Shopping on Particl Marketplace Soon to be AvailableWhile the\nplatform's unapologetically decentralized nature and privacy features make it an\nattractive alternative to centralized e-commerce platforms (which often face\ncensorship, data breaches, and other vulnerabilities), it is currently limited\nto using PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, as the settlement currency. This\nis due to PART’s unique technology being an integral component in enabling some\nof the marketplace's unique features in the first place.\n\nBasicSwap DEX: Enabling Multi-Currency Payments\nLitecoin MWEB Balances and Conversions Live on BasicSwap DEXLitecoin\nMimbleWimble balances and balance conversions are now live on BasicSwap DEX, a\nfirst step towards full MWEB swaps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/litecoin-mweb-balances-and-conversions-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\nBasicSwap DEX is a decentralized exchange protocol and platform powered by\natomic swaps and SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a distributed data and\nmessaging protocol (often referred to as a “mixnet”). It offers a non-custodial\nand privacy-first trading experience, enabling trustless cross-chain swaps\nbetween different cryptocurrencies across various blockchains. And just like\nParticl Marketplace, it imposes no fees, restrictions, or data collection\npractices.\n\nAnd while it has always included Litecoin since its inception, it recently\nintegrated MWEB balances, paving the way for full MWEB swaps once Litecoin's\nupcoming core update — which will detect incoming Litecoin transactions using\nonly the viewkey without requiring the spendkey — goes live.\n\nTrade Litecoin on BasicSwap DEX (Litecoin DEX)By integrating BasicSwap into\nParticl Marketplace, alternative payment options are introduced at the time of\ncheckout, allowing users to seamlessly pay for items using their preferred\ncryptocurrency, a prime candidate of which being the fast and private Litecoin\nMWEB token.\n\nThis synergy aligns perfectly with Litecoin's vision of becoming a viable and\npractical form of digital cash, providing an additional real-world use case that\nfurther solidifies its position.\n\nBuilding Bridges Between Cryptocurrencies\nThe upcoming integration of BasicSwap and Litecoin MWEB on Particl Marketplace\nexemplifies BasicSwap's broader mission of forging bridges between diverse\ncryptocurrency communities and projects through its cross-chain functionality.\nThis synergy unites our efforts toward a shared vision of building a global\neconomy that prioritizes sovereignty and interoperability - the great promise of\ncrypto.\n\nBy enabling the use of Litecoin on Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap fosters a\nsymbiotic relationship that holds immense promise. Cultivating interoperability\nbetween the two ecosystems will accelerate the adoption of Litecoin as a\npractical, decentralized, and privacy-focused payment solution, while further\npositioning Particl as an enabler of financial activities beyond simple\npeer-to-peer transactions.\n\nIf you share this vision, we invite you to join the Particl and BasicSwap\ncommunity as we build towards a sovereign future and contribute to the mission,\nwhether through code or spreading awareness within the Litecoin community\nitself.

This is the future\nof BasicSwap, the atomic swap-based decentralized exchange that promises to be a\ncornerstone of the Particl ecosystem, and a catalyst for the growth of\ndecentralized commerce.\n\nThe Particl Ecosystem: A Beacon of Privacy Against Fiat\nParticl, through a multitude of modular privacy apps, can be understood as an\necosystem designed to respect individuals’ rights, freedoms, and privacy without\ncompromise. \n\nAt the core of the Particl project is the Particl Marketplace, a decentralized\ne-commerce platform that allows buyers and sellers to transact directly without\nintermediaries. This platform is complemented by a suite of privacy-focused\nprotocols that enable users to conduct various activities without relying on\nthird-party service providers.\n\nHowever, as Particl seeks to establish itself as a truly independent and\nself-sustaining ecosystem, a glaring issue has been a lack of avenues for\ninteracting effectively with the Marketplace, and the accessibility shortcomings\nthis represents. \n\nUntil recently, users have had to rely on centralized exchanges or unprotected\nover-the-counter (OTC) deals to acquire PART, the native currency of Particl\nMarketplace settlements, which undermines the platform's core principles of\nprivacy and autonomy.\n\nBridging the Gap: Bringing Decentralized Commerce to All Crypto\nWhile BasicSwap currently functions as an open-source decentralized exchange\napplication designed to facilitate trustless and anonymous trading of digital\nassets for all, its essence transcends that of a mere application; it is\nprimarily a protocol. This distinction, though seemingly minor on the surface,\ncarries profound implications for the future usage and purpose of BasicSwap.\n\nBy integrating it with the Particl Marketplace, thus providing to it\nBasicSwap-powered swap services such as a multi-currency payment option during\ncheckout, it promises to bridge the gap between privacy and decentralized\ncommerce, enabling users to interact with the Particl Marketplace using their\npreferred currency, while seamlessly converting the payment into PART in order\nto interact with certain aspects of the marketplace itself, such as Particl’s\nunique two-party escrow system\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-marketplace/marketplace_escrow.html]\n. The end result is a smooth experience where customers can pay for items in\ntheir preferred currency, which is then converted into PART in the background,\nproviding value to both the end-user and the Particl community of holders.\n\nBenefits that Extend Beyond the Usefulness of Multi-Currency Payments\nOne of the key advantages of BasicSwap is its ability to leverage atomic swap\ntechnology, specifically adaptor signatures, to allow users to exchange\ndifferent cryptocurrencies privately and without the need for a centralized\nintermediary. This not only enhances user security, it also opens up new\npossibilities for inter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects\nand their unique benefits.\n\nImagine a scenario where you wish to purchase an item on the Particl Marketplace\nusing Firo, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that employs the Lelantus protocol\nfor anonymity. With BasicSwap, you can initiate the transaction by sending your\nFiro to a designated address provided by the DEX. \n\nThe coins are then \"burned,\" and the Firo redeem token is exchanged for\nanonymous PART using BasicSwap, which is then used to complete the purchase on\nthe Particl Marketplace. Of course, all of this would happen behind the scenes,\nthe end-user being left with an easy-to-follow and comprehensive user experience\nakin to choosing a “checkout option” on traditional marketplaces.\n\nThis simple act demonstrates the power of atomic swap technology, effectively\ncombining the unique benefits of whatever coin is used as the checkout payment\noption (Firo, Monero, Litecoin MWEB, etc) and RingCT (the privacy protocol used\nby PART) in a single transaction. \n\nBy enabling such inter-compatibility between privacy technologies, BasicSwap\nunlocks a world of possibilities for users seeking to maintain their financial\nprivacy while engaging in decentralized commerce.\n\nThe Implications of a Truly Decentralized and Agnostic Payment System\nWhile the focus of BasicSwap is on bridging privacy projects and privacy coins,\nits true potential extends far beyond this scope. By offering a truly\ndecentralized and agnostic payment system, the BasicSwap protocol opens the door\nto a wide range of use cases and possibilities.\n\nOne exciting prospect is the integration of stablecoins, which could provide a\nmore stable and predictable means of value transfer within the Particl\necosystem. This could be particularly beneficial for e-commerce transactions,\nwhere price volatility can be a concern when cryptocurrency is involved.\n\nMoreover, the potential for anonymous stablecoins, or of anonymous swaps of\nexisting stablecoins, raises intriguing possibilities for enhancing financial\nprivacy while maintaining the benefits of price stability. As the technology\nevolves, BasicSwap's agnostic nature positions it to seamlessly integrate and\nfacilitate the use of such innovative financial instruments within the Particl\nMarketplace and beyond.\n\nConclusion: A Cornerstone for Decentralized Commerce\nThe integration of BasicSwap with the Particl Marketplace represents a\nsignificant milestone in our journey towards financial sovereignty. By providing\na robust and decentralized platform for trading PART and facilitating\ninter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects, BasicSwap is\npoised to become a cornerstone of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nAs the world increasingly recognizes the importance of privacy and autonomy in\nfinancial transactions, platforms like Particl and BasicSwap are poised to lead\nthe way in fostering a truly decentralized and privacy-focused economic\nenvironment. \n\nWith its commitment to agnosticism and its ability to adapt to emerging\ntechnologies, BasicSwap has the potential to revolutionize the way we think\nabout decentralized commerce, paving the way for a future where individuals can\ntransact freely, securely, and without the need for trusted third parties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
