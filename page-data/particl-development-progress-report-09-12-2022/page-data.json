This, in part, means traders can\nmake or take orders at a price of their choosing and on their own terms.\n\nAt this stage of the beta, only full BasicSwap nodes — which need to be compiled\nand ran locally — are available to use. We are however working on deploying more\nconvenient solutions using light and web services as well as integration\ngateways.\n\nFor more in-depth information about BasicSwap, head over to this blog post\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/].\n\nCore Values\nBasicSwap’s unique exchange architecture introduces a lot of benefits for\ncryptocurrency users. Notably, its cross-chain approach radically improves the\nbroader blockchain ecosystem, by promoting healthier and more open trading\nconditions for all, without forcing users to use a specific coin or blockchain\nfor monetization purposes. BasicSwap aims to take down barriers and build\nbridges between various cryptocurrency communities.\n\nThe BasicSwap DEX is shaped by its uncompromising dedication to five core values\nthat we believe are bound to be in the interest of all traders:\n\n 1. Full custody of funds and keys;\n 2. A coin-agnostic architecture;\n 3. No trading fees or intermediary fees of any kind;\n 4. No accounts, limits, or restrictions;\n 5. Complete and total privacy.\n\nThese are the five constitutional values that make up the idea behind the\nBasicSwap protocol, and they guide every step of the way forward.\n\nFrom the Ground up — Uncompromising Commitment to Privacy\nBasicSwap is certainly not the first DEX around, but it does distinguish itself\nin its uncompromising commitment to user privacy. When we say BasicSwap is a\nprivacy-first DEX, it’s not just for buzz; we truly mean it.\n\nIndeed, BasicSwap is born out of a proof of concept\n[https://particl.news/monero-and-particl-atomic-swaps-775f87f6208a/] made 2\nyears ago when the Particl team began testing Monero atomic swaps\n[https://github.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap]. This eventually led to the\nrelease of a rudimentary DEX protocol that used Particl’s privacy-first SMSG\nnetwork, which eventually culminated into the more all-inclusive DEX platform\nthat we see today — complete with an order book and a modern, intuitive GUI.\n\nSuffice to say, privacy has always been at the core of BasicSwap’s history, and\nis its primary reason for existence. This holds true today more than ever.\n\nUnder the Hood\nBasicSwap is made up of a unique combination of leading-edge technologies in the\ndomains of blockchain, cryptography, and peer-to-peer networking. At no point\ndoes it use any centralized or intermediated components — ensuring the maximum\nlevel of security and privacy for all users and their hard-earned funds.\nCensorship, fraud, and misuse of user funds are fundamentally impossible from\nthe application to the protocol level.\n\nAtomic Swaps Atomic swaps have been around for quite some time and are an\nimportant part of many DEX platforms currently available online. They allow for\nswapping digital assets between two users in peer-to-peer fashion, assuming that\nthe logistical requirements behind executing such a swap exist. \n\nThe atomic swap technology is, in and of itself, a relatively narrow-scoped\nprotocol: it does not match orders between two users or provide any DEX\nframework whatsoever. It only safely swaps assets. \n\nFor a properly decentralized DEX to exist, it needs a common and decentralized\nchannel in which the information related to a swap is transferred between two\nparties — sometimes across two entirely different chains. Without this added\nlayer, it is impossible for a chain to know when to release the swap in question\nbecause it isn’t directly connected to the other blockchain. \n\nThis is often where some so-called “DEXs” cut corners and introduce a certain\nlevel of centralization. They offer decentralized swaps, but centralize the\nprocess of matching orders which entirely defeats the purpose of being a DEX in\nthe first place as it introduces a major central point of failure and control.\nIn the case of BasicSwap, this process remains entirely decentralized, thanks to\nthe SMSG network. \n\nMore detailed information on atomic swaps can be found here\n[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Atomic_swap]. \n\nin-progress waiting done SecureMessaging Network (SMSG) SecureMessaging (SMSG)\nis Particl’s own custom-built and unique P2P messaging network, which stands at\nthe core of its ecosystem. Inspired by the BitMessage Protocol\n[https://www.whonix.org/wiki/BitMessage], the SMSG network is a mixnet that acts\nas a decentralized storage network (DSN)\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/glossary.html#term-SecureMessaging-SMSG].\nAs such, it stores and transfers data across nodes in a privacy-preserving\nmanner, encrypted from end to end (E2EE), and without requiring the use of a\ncentral server. \n\nThis decentralized technology is essential in providing the BasicSwap DEX with\nfunctionality not provided by atomic swaps themselves, such as an order book and\norder matching system, as well as with transferring swap data between parties\nswapping from two different chains. \n\nWhen running a BasicSwap client, you are also automatically running an SMSG node\nalong with it. Any DEX and swap related data is then uploaded and downloaded\ndirectly from the SMSG network and interpreted by BasicSwap’s scriptless\nscripts, giving users a full-blown decentralized trading exchange (DEX)\nexperience. \n\nMore in-depth information about the SMSG protocol can be found here\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/] \n\nin-progress waiting done Scriptless Scripts Scriptless scripts are another key\naspect of BasicSwap and are a largely misunderstood and overlooked feature of\nBitcoin and blockchains in general. Originating from MimbleWimble, they are, in\ntheir basic sense, a way to execute secure and private smart contracts off-chain\nusing Schnorr Signatures [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature] or \nECDSA [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm]\n. \n\nIn the case of BasicSwap, two people send coins on a scriptless chain and into\nan address that's created from the sum of one private key from each of them.\nThat way, to spend that output requires them to cooperate through One-Time\nVerifiably Encrypted Signatures (OtVES)\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L154]\n. \n\n> \"A One-Time VES is a signature made invalid by mixing it with the public key of\nan encrypting key pair, a valid signature can be decrypted with knowledge of the\nprivate encrypting key and the private encrypting key can be recovered with\nknowledge of both the encrypted and plaintext signatures.\" Tecnovert — xmrswap\nprotocol notes\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L156] \n \n\n\nCompared to traditional on-chain smart contracts, scriptless scripts provide\nadded privacy and scalability. And compared to the rigid and barebone Bitcoin\nsmart contracts, they add a ton of functionality by allowing for much more\ncomplex and flexible, yet still securely tight, smart contracts. \n\nPrivacy: When on-chain, many details of a smart contract are shared to the\nentire network. These details include the number and addresses of participants\nand the amounts transferred, among other metadata. But because scriptless\nscripts are essentially smart contracts operating off-chain, most of the usage\ndata and user information is NOT shared with the rest of the network. The only\nthing that the network knows is that certain individuals are interacting with a\nsmart contract according to its pre-defined rules. However, depending on the\nspecific implementation, it is also possible for that information to be\ncompletely hidden. \n\nScalability: Smart contracts take up a lot of space on a blockchain. By moving\nthe smart contracting process off-chain, that data does not fill up and bloat\nthe blockchain, leading to much better scalability. The smart contracting\nprocess is also shared between scriptless scripts themselves and the SMSG\nnetwork. \n\nAdditionally, because scriptless scripts are eventually intended to leverage\nSchnorr Signatures, multiple keys can be aggregated into a single one — making\nthe actual smart contract code much lighter and more efficient than traditional\non-chain smart contracts. \n\nin-progress waiting done About the Open Beta Release\nBasicSwap’s open beta is now live, on mainnet, for everyone. That means you can\nnow set up the DEX and start trading with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Monero,\nand others without middlemen, without restrictions, and with no need to worry\nabout the custody of your coins.\n\nConsiderations — What to Expect at This Beta Stage\nThe release of the open beta is a major milestone for BasicSwap, but it is by no\nmeans intended as the final version of it. Indeed, we have much bigger plans for\nit, which you can get a hint at by checking out our roadmap\n[https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap].\n\nIndeed, we feel it is important to put emphasis on the beta aspect of this\nrelease. As such, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:\n\n * It may lack features that you’d like to see in the future.\n * It may feel unfinished or unpolished in some areas.\n * It still needs to be manually compiled.\n * It requires full coin nodes to be synced up and run locally.\n * It requires your node to stay online to complete swaps.\n * It requires your node to stay online for your offers to show up on the books.\n * It requires coin wallets to be unlocked when running.\n\nAll of the considerations mentioned above are merely temporary obstacles that we\nfully plan on resolving as we progress through this open beta phase. Consult\nour\nroadmap [https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap], scheduled to release this coming\nMonday, to get a better understanding of our plans moving forward and of the\nways we intend to improve the platform.\n\nRoadmap and Vision — What’s Next?\nWhile the open beta release of BasicSwap is a major milestone in its journey,\nthe best is yet to come. Indeed, BasicSwap is poised to evolve into a major,\nunstoppable DEX platform with significant innovations that will benefit the\nentire crypto ecosystem.\n\nGenerally speaking, the team will focus on four major technical items moving\nforward, with various other additions, improvements, and fixes along the way.\n\n * SMSG 2.0 — For better scalability, privacy, and efficiency;\n * Integration frameworks — To integrate BasicSwap into third-party platforms,\n   web apps, and more;\n * Privacy-centric updates — To improve user privacy and fund security;\n * Lightning Network — For near-instant swap speed (on eligible coins) and\n   capabilities.\n\nThese are the cornerstone items of our current roadmap. They are the most\nsignificant milestones and the keys to BasicSwap’s vision. While we work on\nthese, you can expect a wide variety of non-related features and improvements to\nalso be added.\n\nAdditionally, we fully plan on adding more coins to the platform as demand for\nit comes our way. As such, we’ve set up a listing application form\n[https://forms.gle/UZhdUJAXdEumVdBi8] on our website that can be filled out to\nrequest new coin listings. Note that, due to BasicSwap’s unique architecture and\nour current development resources, we cannot guarantee a fast integration\nprocess for all coins that apply, but we’ll do our best to work with you on\nthese matters.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo here we are - BasicSwap’s open beta is finally upon us. If you want to\ncontribute to the DEX revolution and help take the power away from those\ngatekeepers best known as centralized exchanges, then spread the word far and\nwide and bring your liquidity on a fair, open, and honest platform for all!\n\nAs more people use decentralized exchanges, liquidity will grow, which will\ncontribute to bringing better, more free trading conditions for all crypto\nusers. A winning scenario for all users of cryptocurrencies and participants in\nthe new digital economy.\n\nBig thank you to all for participating in this open beta, and for anchoring\nyourself in history. We can’t wait to hear about your feedback and see the\nplatform and its usage grow over time!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

Indeed, we have much bigger plans for it, which you can get a hint at by <a href=\"https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap\"><strong>checking out our roadmap</strong></a>.</p><p>Indeed, we feel it is important to put emphasis on the beta aspect of this release. As such, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>It may lack features that you’d like to see in the future.</li><li>It may feel unfinished or unpolished in some areas.</li><li>It still needs to be manually compiled.</li><li>It requires full coin nodes to be synced up and run locally.</li><li>It requires your node to stay online to complete swaps.</li><li>It requires your node to stay online for your offers to show up on the books.</li><li>It requires coin wallets to be unlocked when running.</li></ul><p>All of the considerations mentioned above are merely <strong>temporary obstacles</strong> that we fully plan on resolving as we progress through this open beta phase. <a href=\"https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap\"><strong>Consult our roadmap</strong></a>, scheduled to release this coming Monday, to get a better understanding of our plans moving forward and of the ways we intend to improve the platform.</p><h2 id=\"roadmap-and-vision-what-s-next\">Roadmap and Vision — What’s Next?</h2><p>While the open beta release of BasicSwap is a major milestone in its journey, the best is yet to come. Indeed, BasicSwap is poised to evolve into a major, unstoppable DEX platform with significant innovations that will benefit the entire crypto ecosystem.</p><p>Generally speaking, the team will focus on four major technical items moving forward, with various other additions, improvements, and fixes along the way.</p><ul><li><strong>SMSG 2.0 — </strong>For better scalability, privacy, and efficiency;</li><li><strong>Integration frameworks —</strong> To integrate BasicSwap into third-party platforms, web apps, and more;</li><li><strong>Privacy-centric updates — </strong>To improve user privacy and fund security;</li><li><strong>Lightning Network —</strong> For near-instant swap speed (on eligible coins) and capabilities.</li></ul><p>These are the cornerstone items of our current roadmap. They are the most significant milestones and the keys to BasicSwap’s vision. While we work on these, you can expect a wide variety of non-related features and improvements to also be added.</p><p>Additionally, we fully plan on adding more coins to the platform as demand for it comes our way. As such, we’ve set up a <a href=\"https://forms.gle/UZhdUJAXdEumVdBi8\">listing application form</a> on our website that can be filled out to request new coin listings. Note that, due to BasicSwap’s unique architecture and our current development resources, we cannot guarantee a fast integration process for all coins that apply, but we’ll do our best to work with you on these matters.</p><hr><p>So here we are - BasicSwap’s open beta is finally upon us. If you want to contribute to the DEX revolution and help take the power away from those gatekeepers best known as centralized exchanges, then spread the word far and wide and bring your liquidity on a fair, open, and honest platform for all!</p><p>As more people use decentralized exchanges, liquidity will grow, which will contribute to bringing better, more free trading conditions for all crypto users. A winning scenario for all users of cryptocurrencies and participants in the new digital economy.</p><p>Big thank you to all for participating in this open beta, and for anchoring yourself in history. We can’t wait to hear about your feedback and see the platform and its usage grow over time!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

Notably, its cross-chain approach radically improves the broader blockchain ecosystem, by promoting healthier and more open trading conditions for all, without forcing users to use a specific coin or blockchain for monetization purposes. BasicSwap aims to take down barriers and build bridges between various cryptocurrency communities.</p><p>The BasicSwap DEX is shaped by its uncompromising dedication to five core values that we believe are bound to be in the interest of all traders:</p><ol><li>Full custody of funds and keys;</li><li>A coin-agnostic architecture;</li><li>No trading fees or intermediary fees of any kind;</li><li>No accounts, limits, or restrictions;</li><li>Complete and total privacy.</li></ol><p>These are the five constitutional values that make up the idea behind the BasicSwap protocol, and they guide every step of the way forward.</p><h3 id=\"from-the-ground-up-uncompromising-commitment-to-privacy\">From the Ground up — Uncompromising Commitment to Privacy</h3><p>BasicSwap is certainly not the first DEX around, but it does distinguish itself in its uncompromising commitment to user privacy. When we say BasicSwap is a privacy-first DEX, it’s not just for buzz; we truly mean it.</p><p>Indeed, BasicSwap is born out of a <a href=\"https://particl.news/monero-and-particl-atomic-swaps-775f87f6208a/\">proof of concept</a> made 2 years ago when the Particl team began testing <a href=\"https://github.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap\">Monero atomic swaps</a>. This eventually led to the release of a rudimentary DEX protocol that used Particl’s privacy-first SMSG network, which eventually culminated into the more all-inclusive DEX platform that we see today — complete with an order book and a modern, intuitive GUI.</p><p>Suffice to say, privacy has always been at the core of BasicSwap’s history, and is its primary reason for existence. This holds true today more than ever.</p><h3 id=\"under-the-hood\">Under the Hood</h3><p>BasicSwap is made up of a unique combination of leading-edge technologies in the domains of blockchain, cryptography, and peer-to-peer networking. At no point does it use any centralized or intermediated components — ensuring the maximum level of security and privacy for all users and their hard-earned funds. Censorship, fraud, and misuse of user funds are fundamentally impossible from the application to the protocol level.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center full light-one\" id=\"btn-add_01\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"col\">\n    <div class=\"tabs\">\n      <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">Atomic Swaps</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Atomic swaps have been around for quite some time and are an important part of many DEX platforms currently available online. They allow for swapping digital assets between two users in peer-to-peer fashion, assuming that the logistical requirements behind executing such a swap exist.\n            <br><br> \n            The atomic swap technology is, in and of itself, a relatively narrow-scoped protocol: it does not match orders between two users or provide any DEX framework whatsoever. It only safely swaps assets.\n            <br><br>\n            For a properly decentralized DEX to exist, it needs a common and decentralized channel in which the information related to a swap is transferred between two parties — sometimes across two entirely different chains. Without this added layer, it is impossible for a chain to know when to release the swap in question because it isn’t directly connected to the other blockchain.\n            <br><br>\n            This is often where some so-called “DEXs” cut corners and introduce a certain level of centralization. They offer decentralized swaps, but centralize the process of matching orders which entirely defeats the purpose of being a DEX in the first place as it introduces a major central point of failure and control. In the case of BasicSwap, this process remains entirely decentralized, thanks to the SMSG network.\n            <br><br>\n            More detailed information on atomic swaps can be found \n            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Atomic_swap\">here</a>.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n        \n      <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck2\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck2\">SecureMessaging Network (SMSG)</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            SecureMessaging (SMSG) is Particl’s own custom-built and unique P2P messaging network, which stands at the core of its ecosystem.

Indeed, we have much bigger plans for it, which you can get a hint at by <a href=\"https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap\"><strong>checking out our roadmap</strong></a>.</p><p>Indeed, we feel it is important to put emphasis on the beta aspect of this release. As such, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>It may lack features that you’d like to see in the future.</li><li>It may feel unfinished or unpolished in some areas.</li><li>It still needs to be manually compiled.</li><li>It requires full coin nodes to be synced up and run locally.</li><li>It requires your node to stay online to complete swaps.</li><li>It requires your node to stay online for your offers to show up on the books.</li><li>It requires coin wallets to be unlocked when running.</li></ul><p>All of the considerations mentioned above are merely <strong>temporary obstacles</strong> that we fully plan on resolving as we progress through this open beta phase. <a href=\"https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap\"><strong>Consult our roadmap</strong></a>, scheduled to release this coming Monday, to get a better understanding of our plans moving forward and of the ways we intend to improve the platform.</p><h2 id=\"roadmap-and-vision-what-s-next\">Roadmap and Vision — What’s Next?</h2><p>While the open beta release of BasicSwap is a major milestone in its journey, the best is yet to come. Indeed, BasicSwap is poised to evolve into a major, unstoppable DEX platform with significant innovations that will benefit the entire crypto ecosystem.</p><p>Generally speaking, the team will focus on four major technical items moving forward, with various other additions, improvements, and fixes along the way.</p><ul><li><strong>SMSG 2.0 — </strong>For better scalability, privacy, and efficiency;</li><li><strong>Integration frameworks —</strong> To integrate BasicSwap into third-party platforms, web apps, and more;</li><li><strong>Privacy-centric updates — </strong>To improve user privacy and fund security;</li><li><strong>Lightning Network —</strong> For near-instant swap speed (on eligible coins) and capabilities.</li></ul><p>These are the cornerstone items of our current roadmap. They are the most significant milestones and the keys to BasicSwap’s vision. While we work on these, you can expect a wide variety of non-related features and improvements to also be added.</p><p>Additionally, we fully plan on adding more coins to the platform as demand for it comes our way. As such, we’ve set up a <a href=\"https://forms.gle/UZhdUJAXdEumVdBi8\">listing application form</a> on our website that can be filled out to request new coin listings. Note that, due to BasicSwap’s unique architecture and our current development resources, we cannot guarantee a fast integration process for all coins that apply, but we’ll do our best to work with you on these matters.</p><hr><p>So here we are - BasicSwap’s open beta is finally upon us. If you want to contribute to the DEX revolution and help take the power away from those gatekeepers best known as centralized exchanges, then spread the word far and wide and bring your liquidity on a fair, open, and honest platform for all!</p><p>As more people use decentralized exchanges, liquidity will grow, which will contribute to bringing better, more free trading conditions for all crypto users. A winning scenario for all users of cryptocurrencies and participants in the new digital economy.</p><p>Big thank you to all for participating in this open beta, and for anchoring yourself in history. We can’t wait to hear about your feedback and see the platform and its usage grow over time!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nMulti-Net Support ?\nMultinet by tecnovert · Pull Request #311 · basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
