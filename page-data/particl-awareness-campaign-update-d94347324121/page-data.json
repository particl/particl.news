With this, the Awareness Campaign is now resumed\n[https://friends.particl.community], with sign up payouts disabled, so that you\ncan continue earning staking shares by referring your friends to Particl. When\nyou reach 12 points, you will earn your first staking share. Each additional\npoint will reward you with a staking share.\n\nFor more details, read our latest blog post on the Awareness Campaign by\nfollowing this link: \nhttps://particl.news/particl-awareness-campaign-update-d94347324121\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe announced a few days before the NYC Blockchain Week that we were launching an\nawareness campaign to get more people to know about Particl. While we expected\nthe campaign to reach a few hundred people, it blew up and went viral overnight,\nreaching the hidden payouts cap that had been set up for the campaign in just a\nfew hours.\n\nWith the first payouts being initially scheduled for today, we’d like to thank\neverybody that has participated in the campaign so for and keep you updated on\nthe status of the campaign and let you know what comes next!\n\nThe Campaign Goes Viral\nThis awareness campaign was initially designed to be a grassroots initiative to\nget friends to know about Particl and its Open Marketplace. Little did we know,\nthe campaign became viral in a matter of mere hours and was shared within many\nmassive airdrop and signup groups, creating a rapid influx of participants\novernight.\n\nAwareness Campaign Stats\n * Number of registered participants: 16,944\n * Number of participants automatically detected as fraudulent: 6,657\n * Number of Particl Desktop downloads during campaign: ~2,000\n * Hidden payouts cap reached after: ~16 hours\n * Number of participants that qualify for staking shares: 105\n\nCircumventing Fraud\nBecause we did not expect this campaign to get as viral as it did, and so\nrapidly, we’ve been surprised by the huge amount of fraudulent participation\nwe’ve received. Luckily, the platform we’re using to run the campaign was set up\nto automatically flag fraudulent emails based on various criteria. In total, the\nsystem flagged 6,657 fake emails based on a wide variety of criteria, excluding\nthese participants from the campaign.\n\nAdditionally, we’ve been running our own script to find any other fraudulent\nemail that would bypass the platform’s filter. In the end, it turns out that \nonly ~1,800 participants have properly followed all the steps required by the\ncampaign, a figure that matches closely the approximate number of unique Particl\nDesktop downloads.\n\nCampaign Status\nThe fraud attempts have required more time to sort out than expected. We also\nwanted to take off as many fake participants as possible in order to keep the\ncontest fair for the honest participants.\n\nTo make that process easier, we temporarily paused the campaign until we could\nbuild scripts that would be able to automatically filter large amounts of emails\nand private addresses and get them sorted on a database so that we could process\npayouts more effectively.\n\nAs such, we still need a bit of time before processing payment, a process that\nwill probably extend over the next few days.\n\nWhen Will I Receive my Payout?\nIf you qualify for the signup payouts, don’t worry, it is normal that you\nhaven’t received anything yet. You should be receiving your payment within the\nnext few hours/days. You won’t need to do anything special to claim your PART,\nit will simply eventually show up on your Overview page as an incoming\ntransaction!\n\nAs a reminder, here are the criteria to qualify for payouts:\n\n * Sign up on https://friends.particl.community/\n * Verify your email after signing up\n * Send your stealth address to friends@particl.io\n * Complete the steps above before the hidden payout cap is reached (within the\n   first 16 hours of the campaign)\n\nIf you also qualify for staking shares, meaning that you at least got 10 of your\nfriends to sign up with Particl, you should also receive your first payment\nshortly.\n\nAs a reminder, here are the criteria to qualify for staking shares:\n\n * Sign up on https://friends.particl.community/\n * Verify your email after signing up\n * Send your stealth address to friends@particl.io\n * Get more than 10 friends to sign up with Particl\n\nWhat We’ve Learned From this Campaign\nThis campaign has had good results — Particl Desktop has been downloaded around\n2,000 times during this campaign. After all, the goal was to get users playing\naround with crypto’s best-looking wallet!\n\nBut it is also very clear that the system has been abused to a bigger extent\nthan we expected it to be. Nearly 17,000 people participated, but there were\nonly around 2,000 unique downloads of Particl Desktop and around 1,800\nparticipants that went through the campaign’s steps properly. That means that,\nright out of the bat, around 15,000 (~88%) participants haven’t properly gone\nthrough the process of qualifying for payouts.\n\nThis has been a good experiment that has brought valuable insight as to how to\nimprove future awareness campaigns and how to sustain larger degrees of\nparticipation. We look forward to initiating similar campaigns in the future by\nusing the goods, without the bads, of this awareness campaign.\n\nWhat Now?\nOnce the first payouts will be paid, we will resume the Awareness Campaign as\nplanned. Remember, now that the hidden payouts cap has been reached after only\n16 hours into the campaign, the only reward for signing up with Particl will be\nthe staking shares earned once you get more than 10 of your friends to sign up\nas well.\n\nKeep your eyes close to your Particl Desktop wallet. Once you receive your\npayment, the Awareness Campaign will resume and you’ll be able to start earning\npoints again by getting your friends to sign up on \nhttps://friends.particl.community/.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe would like to thank everyone that has participated in the campaign so far and\nwish you the best luck in your hunt for staking shares!\n\nIf you have any question regarding the Awareness Campaign, join our Particl\nAwareness Telegram channel by following this link: https://t.me/particlawareness\n.\n\nTo read the announcement post for the campaign, follow this link: \nhttps://particl.news/announcement-particl-awareness-campaign-464baa8477b5\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Particl Team","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Awareness-Campaign-Update/1-0aizM4VoRA47jkDdp0fdDA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><hr><p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>The sign up payouts for the Awareness Campaign have been executed earlier today.

The OMP Library was written some\ntime ago by Particl’s developer Kewde, but the team wanted to make some\nmodifications to it and run proper testing, specifically related to the buy\nflow, before putting it onto mainnet.\n\nThe OMP Library is a major improvement to the backend of the Particl Open\nMarketplace, allowing for example escrows to process transactions automatically\nusing Confidential Transactions or for listings to have more attributes.\n\nWe are happy to say that the integration of the blind escrow system into the\nmarketplace is now complete.\n\nFinish the OMP Library Integration Tests (In Progress)\nThe next step is to finalize the OMP Library integration by running the whole\nsuite of automated tests the team has built over the last two years. These\nautomated tests are designed to stress test any new feature and try to break\nthem in any possible way.\n\nWhen a test fails, it highlights precisely what the problems are that need to be\nupdated, adjusted or changed. Once issues are fixed, the test is ran again until\nit finds another issue. Because of the unpredictability of the testing results,\nwe would rather not give an estimate today but rather wait a few days until\nafter these tests are complete.\n\nWe initially intended to finish those tests before flying out to the NYC\nBlockchain Week and then run the final testnet build while we were at the\nconferences. However, we fell short by a few days before Juha, Particl’s Lead\nMarketplace Developer, joined the team in New York City to present the Open\nMarketplace. This has unfortunately caused a few days of delay and is the reason\nwhy we are still finalizing the tests to this day. He has now safely made it\nback home and has resumed the last few tests before we put out what will be the\nfinal testnet build before the first mainnet release.\n\nNote that running these tests is not a very challenging or difficult process. To\nthe contrary, this is quite a redundant task, but it requires time. While a\nmajority of the tests has been completed successfully, it is difficult to give a\nclear estimate of how long it will take to complete the remaining ones. We\nactually expect this process to be over pretty quickly now, and we will\ncommunicate a more definitive timeline as soon as these tests are done.\n\nWhy are These Tests so Important?\nThese automated tests are extremely important, and they are part of what makes\nParticl stand out from the crowd as a super secure network. Every feature we put\nout in the wild is tested against a variety of automated tests to ensure that it\nis as secure and stable as we can possibly make it.\n\nThe tests are especially important when it comes to core marketplace components.\nIn fact, there’s a reason why everything has to be perfect when it gets moved\nonto mainnet, especially when it comes to the buy flow and escrow of the\nmarketplace.\n\nIn fact, once the marketplace goes out on mainnet, we have to assume that there\nwill always be acts of commerce, even if it’s not publicly visible. That puts a\nhuge amount of limitations on what can be updated if we want to ensure the\nsecurity of our users’ funds. Imagine rebuilding a motor in a race car…while\nit’s on the track racing.\n\nTake the escrow system as an example. If the network pushes a big update on the\nseller side while there are some ongoing marketplace transactions with funds\nlocked in escrow, then the escrow would encounter new (unexpected) code that\ncould potentially cause critical bugs where funds could be lost. As you can\nimagine, a test network is much more forgiving of bugs than a mainnet\nenvironment!\n\n> Imagine rebuilding a motor in a race car while it’s on the track\nracing. — Joe Fisher\nThat doesn’t mean the Open Marketplace cannot have its components updated after\nit launches. It just means that coding new changes will be much more time\nconsuming as we need to make sure new and old codes can recognize each other and\nare fully compatible. That alone, as you can expect, would require a lot of\ntesting before unleashing on mainnet.\n\nThis is precisely why we have such a perfectionist approach to the mainnet\nrelease.\n\nIntegrate the OMP Library into Particl Desktop (Pending)\nOnce the tests are done, Particl Desktop will need to be tweaked to integrate\nthe last few changes. This step of the process is actually much easier and quick\nto complete than it sounds. As some aspects of the OMP Library change how the\nbackend works, Particl Desktop has to be tweaked so that the integration works\nflawlessly. Don’t worry, this should take only 1 or 2 days at most for the\nintegration to be worked in as there hasn’t been any modification made to\nParticl Desktop since our last testnet except for the few changes to the buy\nflow caused by the integration of the OMP Library.\n\nLast Testnet Build Before Mainnet (Pending)\nAs soon as the Particl Desktop tweaks are done, we will be packaging, for the\ncommunity, what will be the final testnet build before the first mainnet release\nof the Particl Open Marketplace!\n\nBecause the marketplace has already been thoroughly tested during the last few\nmonths, we do not expect any major issue to be identified. What will be the\nimportant thing to test here will be the buy flow and the blind escrow, but as\nthey will already have went through a ton of automated tests prior to being\nreleased on testnet, it is likely that no issue arises.\n\nNevertheless, we want as many testers as possible to test this final testnet\nclient before the first-ever mainnet build. This is the reason why we will be\nrunning a short bug hunting contest where we’ll be giving away a total of $500\nworth of PART to the best bug hunters out there! We will reveal all of the\ndetails once we publish the testnet build.\n\nWe estimate that, if all goes smoothly, this testnet build will run for a\nduration of approximately 1 week. Keep in mind this isn’t a deadline or a hard\ndate, but an estimation of how long we’d like to keep it running if no major\nissue arises.\n\nThen, once that is all said and done, the time to get the Open Marketplace live\non mainnet will be upon us!\n\nMainnet Release of the Open Marketplace (Pending)\nThis is the moment we’ve all been waiting for — the mainnet release of the Open\nMarketplace. This milestone event will see the marketplace make its way onto\nmainnet and be able to be used to buy and sell real products and services, with\nreal funds. This big moment will follow right after we complete the last testnet\nrun of the Open Marketplace before it goes on mainnet for the first time.\n\nSo When is it Coming Out on Mainnet, Exactly?\nAt this very moment, we still cannot commit to a fixed date due to the fact that\nthe tests are still running. The automated tests are expected to be completed\nwithin a pretty short time frame of a few days, though. Then, once it’s done, 1\nto 2 days will need to be allocated to tweak Particl Desktop and then the last\ntestnet will be released to the public for a period of approximately 1 week, if\nall goes smoothly. We definitely want and will communicate a more precise\ntimeline for the mainnet release as soon as we complete the OMP Library\nintegration tests. However, this development update should still be able to give\nyou a rough estimate of the timeline we’re currently looking into.\n\nIn the meantime, we are following up on our leads and connections we’ve made at\nthe Magical Crypto Conference and Consensus in order to maximize the exposure of\nthe mainnet release of the Particl Open Marketplace and adjust our strategy in\nlight of the new contacts we’ve made.\n\nAfter nearly two years of intensive development, we are nearly there! All\nfeatures intended to be part of the first mainnet version of the marketplace\nhave been integrated and are going through their final automated testing rounds.\nAlthough we are not able to give a definitive date for the mainnet release\ntoday, we will be communicating one very shortly.\n\nHang tight because from here on out, things will get very interesting!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews Flash: Particl Bulletproofs Audit by Quarkslab\nOn a non-marketplace related note, we are pleased to announce that Quarkslab\n[https://www.quarkslab.com/en/] has started auditing our Bitcoin-based\nBulletproofs integration. Quarkslab is a world-renowned security firm having\naudited codes and projects like OpenSSL\n[https://ostif.org/the-ostif-and-quarkslab-audit-of-openssl-is-complete/], \nVeraCrypt\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/veracrypt-audit-multiple-critical-vulnerabilities,32878.html]\n, OpenVPN [https://blog.quarkslab.com/security-assessment-of-openvpn.html], and,\ninterestingly enough, Monero’s Bulletproofs implementation\n[https://blokt.com/news/monero-fixes-all-bulletproof-protocol-vulnerabilities-found-in-second-security-audit]\n.\n\nOnce the audit is done, we’ll look into the report, address any potential issue\nit identifies, and start planning ahead for a hardfork of Particl’s RingCT with\nBulletproofs on mainnet.\n\nWe will keep you informed as details come in!\n\nWelcome — Quarkslab [https://www.quarkslab.com/en/]\nEvery security issue is different, every solution must be\n[https://www.quarkslab.com/en/]www.quarkslab.com [https://www.quarkslab.com/en/]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Coming up?\nWith all the intended features for the first mainnet version of the marketplace\nbeing integrated, part of the development team has now started working on the\nnext features that will be integrated into the marketplace. Note that none of\nthese new features will be included in the first mainnet version of the Open\nMarketplace. As the build is pretty stable right now, we do not want to\nintegrate new functions that could delay the mainnet release.\n\nQuantity Management\nA must-have for vendors running a business out of their sales. Quantity\nManagement is like a lite version of the full Inventory Management system we\nplan on integrating later during the Beta phase of development. It allows\nvendors to set quantities for their listings and lets people bid multiple times\non the same listings if the vendors set their quantity accordingly.\n\nFuture Features\nThe Particl team also has other features it would like to focus on first after\nthe mainnet release of the Open Marketplace. We still want to go through a few\nother development meeting sessions before communicating what other features\nother than Quantity Management will be worked on first. We will let you know all\nof the information after the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis concludes the Development Update part of this Community Update.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
