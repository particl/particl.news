We've\nopted to create a specific section for it named \"Progress\" and available on the\nnavigation bar at the top of this page. This reduces the bloat on the start page\nand makes it easier to follow the course of events that surround Particl. Follow\nthe link here [https://particl.news/tag/progress/] to get all the progress\nreports. \n\nNow let's get to the interesting part!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Development Progress\nA good portion of the week has been spent on improving SMSG messages propagation\nand handling from Particl Desktop to fix an outstanding issue that caused\nproblems for some users. A change was made to the marketplace handling of the\nresponse from core regarding sent messages; instead of failing only when a\nspecific failure case is met, it should now fail for everything unless it meets\nspecific success criteria. Although the fix still requires more testing, it's\nlikely that the issue is fixed by now. A few other reported issues are being\nlooked into, as is usual.\n\nAside from that, progress has continued over the previously-stated items,\ngradually leading up to the Particl Desktop 3.1 version.\n\n * Several features related to better vendor inventory import/update. This\n   includes the provision of a product code (allowing for updates to items via\n   CSV amongst other things), the ability to update pricing via the batch\n   publish window, and the ability to import images through the CSV file\n   directly (with the possibility to specify the category and target market\n   directly from the CSV coming soon as well). This task has been marked with\n   notable progress this week.\n * The usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace for better,\n   more customizable formatting. This task has already been started but has been\n   put on pause until the above items are completed. It is estimated that this\n   item will be completed very quickly once its development resumes.\n * Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address\n   requirement (i.e., download links, NFTs, user codes, etc.). This task has not\n   been started yet.\n\nParticl Core and Other Development Progress\nThis week on the Core side of things, a lot of merges and updates have gone into\nParticl Core and the SMSG network. Notably, some investigation and work have\ngone towards looking into reducing marketplace listing fees, which should go\ninto effect in a future hardfork. As always, you can track Particl Core\ndevelopments by checking out the Github repository here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core].\n\nAdditionally, BasicSwap has received a lot of focus this week with breakthrough\nachievements being reached. Stay tuned for more details soon!\n\nMarketplace Listing Seeding Proposal\nFinally, there have been a few questions regarding the fully-funded Listing\nSeeding Proposal and its development status. We can confirm that the proposal is\nindeed under development at this present time, but as mentioned in the proposal,\nit is being done mostly outside of Particl's regular work scope. It's also being\ndeveloped in a private capacity.\n\nSince publishing the proposal, several iterations have been explored and the\nproject has evolved into a more important undertaking. While we do not want to\nconfirm any final structure at this moment, we are working towards making the\nsystem more open ended-instead of limited to the members who initially published\nthe proposal.\n\nIndeed, we are heavily considering making the \"listing seeding system\" usable by\nany community member looking to populate the marketplace with listings and\nmanage them from a web interface.\n\nAs a final note on this subject, it's important to be aware that this proposal\nis now dependent on a few upcoming items, notably the SMSG Controller roadmap\nitem. Additionally, while not a hard requirement, it would highly benefit from\nSMSG 2.0 which, if you remember, is expected to dramatically increase the\nscalability of Particl apps and services.\n\nFrom now on, we will include development updates for this proposal, when there\nis any to mention, in the weekly progress reports such as this one.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe wish you a great weekend and thank you all for your incredible support and\npassion for the project's mission. We often mention it, but it's never enough;\nyou are what makes Particl possible and we are grateful to have such an awesome\ncommunity along for the ride!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

Соответственно, она не может\nбыть под управлением какой-либо центральной организации, третьей стороны или\nпосредника. Вместо всего этого она управляется исключительно всем сообществом ее\nпользователей, образующих сеть Particl. Сеть работает аналогично тому, как\nработают торрент-сети p2p, например, и точно также она не может быть подвергнута\nцензуре.\n\nКаталог товаров на торговой площадке\nТорговая площадка Particl Marketplace - это децентрализованное приложение,\nпостроенное на базе сети Particl. Она дает возможность любому человеку,\nнаходящемуся в любой точке мира, покупать либо продавать глобально или локально\nкакие либо товары и услуги, физические или цифровые. Торговая площадка не\nтребует регистрации, личной информации, подписки и является бесплатной для\nиспользования. Поскольку она полностью децентрализована, то нет ни персонала, ни\nслужбы поддержки для разрешения возможных споров между покупателем и продавцом.\nОднако, это вовсе не означает что не существует никакой системы, обеспечивающей\nчестность сделок. Кроме того, торговая площадка Particl является полностью\nконфиденциальной по умолчанию, а это означает что нет привязки каких-либо\nидентификационных данных к кому-либо из ее пользователей.  Например,  все\nфинансовые транзакции, проводимые на торговой площадке, анонимны и скрыты в\nблокчейне, и, что наиболее важно - невозможно отследить их связь с какими-либо\nпокупками на торговой площадке. Кроме этого, загруженные изображения товаров\nвсегда удаляются из метаданных, а весь обмен данными, связанный с действиями на\nторговой площадке, включая и обмен сообщениями между пользователями, надежно\nзашифрован. И наконец, вы также можете подключаться к сети Particl p2p через\nсеть Tor и, таким образом, пользоваться Particl Marketplace с дополнительным\nуровнем анонимности.  Другими словами, пользователи торговой площадки настолько\nанонимны насколько это позволяют самые современные технологии обеспечения\nконфиденциальности.\n\n\nДоверие партнеру\n\nОднако, сочетание всех упомянутых выше характеристик анонимности и\nконфиденциальности торговой площадки создает некоторую проблему, когда речь\nзаходит о доверии вашему партнеру по сделке на торговой прощадке (будь-то\nпокупатель или продавец). На традиционных централизованных торговых площадках\nтакой проблемы не существует с точки зрения покупателя - там все продавцы\nидентифицированы и эти платформы обычно имеют либо “центр разрешения споров”,\nлибо систему эскроу. И это добавляет пользователям уверенности, что их партнер\nбудет вести себя честно.  И это работает...в большинстве случаев\n[https://www.thestreet.com/personal-finance/education/top-ebay-scams-14781610]. \nОднако торговая площадка Particl полностью децентрализована и конфиденциальна.\nЭто означает что нет никакого персонала, который мог бы решать возможные\nпроблемы и следить за тем, чтобы все стороны сделки были честны друг с другом.\nИтак, каким образом вы могли бы предотвратить недобросовестное выполнение\nусловий сделки одним из участников, если их личность конфиденциальна и нет\nникакой центральной власти, которая могла бы наказать плохих парней? Как может\nпокупатель отправить платеж первым, а потом спокойно надеяться, что его товар\nприбудет в хорошем состоянии, и что  вообще прибудет?  Или - может ли продавец\nрисковать, отправляя товар до получения предоплаты? Все это сводится к доверию,\nа доверять незнакомцам в интернете, особенно использующим передовые технологии\nконфиденциальност\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd/]и,\nвсегда было рискованно и, откровенно говоря - неразумно. \n\n Именно здесь и вступает в игру инновационная система двустороннего условного\nдепонирования MAD эскроу, разработанная Particl.\n\n\n\nДвусторонняя система условного депонирования MAD эскроу\nКак совершить покупку на торговой площадке\nКак и большинство других торговых площадок, Particl Marketplace использует\nсистему эскроу для обеспечения честности участников сделок друг с другом.\nОсновное различие между системой эскроу от Particl и традиционно используемыми\nсистемами эскроу заключается в том, что она полностью двустороння, т.е. вам не\nнужно доверять какой-либо 3-й стороне или посреднику, который выступит гарантом\nчестного выполнения условий сделки как продавцом, так и покупателем. Она также\nявляется бесплатной, конфиденциальной по умолчанию и полностью\nавтоматизированной между покупателем и продавцом. Это реальный новаторский\nподход, когда эскроу не требует какого-либо персонала для работы! Во-первых, это\nзначительно повышает конфиденциальность всех участников, гарантируя что все\nдетали транзакций, номера счетов, номера накладных, содержание переговоров и\nлюбая другая информация остаются конфиденциальными между двумя сторонами сделки\n(покупателем и продавцом).   Во вторых, никто не будет взимать с вас плату за\nсвои услуги, так как ни один посредник, например эскроу-агент или персонал\nслужбы поддержки пользователей, фактически никакие услуги вам не оказывает.\nТакже это значительно упрощает процесс и делает эффективность эскроу настолько\nмасштабируемой, насколько это позволяет сама сеть - нет необходимости нанимать\nбольше сотрудников по мере роста платформы или беспокоиться о расписании для\nмодераторов и их доступности, в отличие от других децентрализованных площадок\n(например, эскроу-система OpenBazaar 3-of-2).Хотите спросить - а как же такое\nвообще возможно? Как могут две стороны сделки быть честными друг с другом без\nкакого-либо контроля  третьего лица?\n\n\nДвойные депозиты\nАлгоритм работы системы двойных депозитов MAD\nДля предотвращения нечестного поведения любой из двух сторон сделки обычно\nтребуется сдерживающий фактор или возможность наказания. Как правило, на\nтрадиционных торговых площадках это наказание обычно заключается в том, что\nмодератор принимает меры против виновной стороны. Однако его решение тоже может\nбыть несправедливо по отношению к одной из сторон (подсказка: платформы\nэлектронной коммерции почти всегда  принимают решения в пользу покупателя, а не\nпродавца). На Particl Marketplace это наказание/сдерживающий фактор заключается\nв форме двойных депозитов и теории игр. Эскроу система Particl функционирует\nпросто, но при этом довольно эффективно. Вкратце ее можно описать так: при\nсовершении сделки на торговой площадке обе стороны (покупатель и продавец)\nдолжны внести в смарт контракт эскроу страховой залог,  в сумме стоимости товара\nплюс стоимость доставки . Это и будет гарантия того, что и покупатель, и\nпродавец будут связаны одной цепью в игре. Затем, как только сторона покупателя\nподтвердит что сделка была завершена удовлетворительно - страховые залоги\nвозвращаются каждой стороне без какой-либо комиссии, за исключением обычной\nкомиссии за криптовалютную транзакцию.Чтобы наглядно показать как это работает,\nвозьмем пример:  кто-то покупает товар стоимостью 100 долларов с затратами на\nдоставку 10 долларов. Этот покупатель должен внести 220 долларов на смарт\nконтракт эскроу, из которых  110 долларов - это оплата покупаемого товара,\nвключая стоимость доставки, и еще 110 долларов - это страховой  залог, который\nбудет возвращен полностью и без какой-либо комиссии после сделки. Продавец, со\nсвоей стороны, должен внести такой же страховой залог как и покупатель, т.е. он\nдолжен внести на смарт контракт эскроу такую же сумму в 110 долларов, плюс\nотправить товар стоимостью 110 долларов( со стоимостью его доставки\nвключительно). Таким образом, каждая из сторон будет иметь по 220 долларов,\nвовлеченных в процесс.   Эти средства обеих сторон будут оставаться\nзаблокированными в смарт контракте эскроу, пока продавец упакует и отправит\nзаказ, а затем покупатель его получит и оценит - все ли так, как ему обещали.\n Довольный покупатель помечает сделку как завершенную и это разблокирует смарт\nконтракт эскроу, после чего покупатель автоматически получит обратно свой\nстраховой залог, а продавец - страховой залог плюс оплату за товар, включая\nстоимость доставки.\n\nТеория игры взаимного гарантированного уничтожения (MAD / Mutually Assured\nDestruction)\nВоенная доктрина Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)\nПричина, по которой эта эскроу система работает, очень проста: если хотя бы одна\nиз двух сторон попытается обмануть другую сторону либо будет вести себя\nнекорректно, то сделка не завершается и страховой залог остаётся заблокированным\nдля обоих.Единственный способ для обеих сторон вернуть свой залог обратно - это\nдоговориться так, чтобы все остались довольны в конечном итоге. Только после\nэтого покупатель,  удовлетворившись согласованным решением, отметит транзакцию\nкак завершенную, возвращая автоматически себе страховой залог, а продавцу его\nзалог и оплату. Такой порядок действий часто называют Взаимным Гарантированным\nУничтожением/Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction].  Это хорошо\nизвестная военная доктрина\n[https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2016/09/09/mutually-assured-destruction-game-theory-and-the-cold-war/]\n, основанная на теории игр. Теория гласит, что если две страны обладают ядерным\nоружием, они не будут применять его друг против друга. Причина этого довольно\nпроста - если одна страна запускает ядерную бомбу в сторону другой страны, то\nпрактически гарантировано, что и другая страна ответит тем же, так же запустит\nядерную бомбу. В конечном итоге обе страны по сути уничтожат друг друга с\nпомощью оружия массового поражения. Другими словами - обе страны в итоге\nпроигрывают, так как обе превращаются в пыль, поэтому эта теория игр и\nназывается Взаимным Гарантированным Уничтожением. \n\n Эффективность этой теории игр была наглядно продемонстрирована в реальном\nсценарии во времена Холодной войны, когда и США и СССР сильно угрожали друг\nдругу ядерными боеголовками. Ракеты были явно нацелены на каждую соперничающую\nстрану, но никогда не было инициировано ядерное нападение из-за страха\nвозмездия.\n\nКак эта теория связана с эскроу-системой Particl?\n Двусторонняя система условного депонирования MAD эскроу имеет- это примерно тот\nже принцип действия, только здесь теория игр вращается вокруг финансовых потерь\nвместо использования ядерного оружия. Здесь важно понять, что вся теория игр MAD\nвращается вокруг того факта, что если одна из сторон поведет себя некорректно,\nто будут наказаны обе вовлеченные стороны. В случае Particl таким сдерживающим\nфактором является чистая финансовая потеря.  Ни одна из сторон не получит свой\nзалог обратно и, таким образом, оба будут в  убытке если не смогут договориться\nо решении, приемлемом для обоих. Следовательно - такая теория игр вынудит обе\nстороны активно работать над достижением взаимноприемлемой договоренности , не\nпривлекая  какого-либо посредника для урегулирования разногласий. Если у них не\nполучится договориться - то оба потеряют деньги, а это никому не нужно. Если же\nони  достигнут соглашения, то смогут успешно завершить рыночную сделку без\nуплаты комиссий  (за исключением обычной комиссии как за транзакцию\nкриптовалюты) и без разглашения каких-либо личных или деловых данных какой-либо\nвнешней стороне или посреднику. Эта модель эскроу не только расширяет\nвозможности, но и позволяет с уверенностью утверждать, что ни одна внешняя\nсторона не будет иметь доступа к информации, которой обмениваются две стороны\nсделки. Это кардинально меняет правила игры, особенно для цепочек поставок и\nделикатных бизнес-сделок, когда ни один из участников не хочет, чтобы какая-либо\nтретья сторона совала свой нос. Здесь не нужно раскрывать реквизиты аккаунта\nэскроу-агенту , не просматривается история транзакций, не просматривается номер\nотслеживания доставки либо адрес доставки, переговоры не записываются и т.д.\nТакже и в блокчейне нет ничего отслеживаемого либо как-то идентифицирующего\nучастников.\n\nКонфиденциальность\n Вероятно, самой мощной особенностью всего этого эскроу-механизма является тот\nфакт, что все валютные транзакции инициируются с использованием мощного\nпротокола конфиденциальности RingCT. Сам смарт-контракт эскроу работает с\nиспользованием приватного протокола Конфиденциальных транзакций/Confidential\nTransactions (CT), но все входящие и исходящие транзакции в нем выполняются с\nпомощью RingCT.

Как могут две стороны сделки быть честными друг с другом без какого-либо контроля  третьего лица?<br></p><h3 id=\"--2\">Двойные депозиты</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*83zap8l7onknenEufi6rAg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Алгоритм работы системы двойных депозитов MAD</figcaption></figure><p><br> Для предотвращения нечестного поведения любой из двух сторон сделки обычно требуется сдерживающий фактор или возможность наказания. Как правило, на традиционных торговых площадках это наказание обычно заключается в том, что модератор принимает меры против виновной стороны. Однако его решение тоже может быть несправедливо по отношению к одной из сторон (подсказка: <strong>платформы электронной коммерции почти всегда  принимают решения в пользу покупателя, а не продавца</strong>). На Particl Marketplace это наказание/сдерживающий фактор заключается в форме двойных депозитов и теории игр. Эскроу система Particl функционирует просто, но при этом довольно эффективно. Вкратце ее<strong> </strong>можно описать так: <strong>при совершении сделки на торговой площадке обе стороны (покупатель и продавец) должны внести в смарт контракт эскроу страховой залог,  в сумме стоимости товара плюс стоимость доставки </strong>. Это и будет гарантия того, что и покупатель, и продавец будут связаны одной цепью в игре. Затем, как только сторона покупателя подтвердит что сделка была завершена удовлетворительно - страховые залоги возвращаются каждой стороне без какой-либо комиссии, за исключением обычной комиссии за криптовалютную транзакцию.Чтобы наглядно показать как это работает, возьмем пример:  кто-то покупает товар стоимостью 100 долларов с затратами на доставку 10 долларов. Этот покупатель должен внести 220 долларов на смарт контракт эскроу, из которых  110 долларов - это оплата покупаемого товара, включая стоимость доставки, и еще 110 долларов - это страховой  залог, который будет возвращен полностью и без какой-либо комиссии после сделки. Продавец, со своей стороны, должен внести такой же страховой залог как и покупатель, т.е. он должен внести на смарт контракт эскроу такую же сумму в 110 долларов, плюс отправить товар стоимостью 110 долларов( со стоимостью его доставки включительно). Таким образом, каждая из сторон будет иметь по 220 долларов, вовлеченных в процесс.   Эти средства обеих сторон будут оставаться заблокированными в смарт контракте эскроу, пока продавец упакует и отправит заказ, а затем покупатель его получит и оценит - все ли так, как ему обещали.  Довольный покупатель помечает сделку как завершенную и это разблокирует смарт контракт эскроу, после чего покупатель автоматически получит обратно свой страховой залог, а продавец - страховой залог плюс оплату за товар, включая стоимость доставки.</p><h3 id=\"-mad-mutually-assured-destruction-\">Теория игры взаимного гарантированного уничтожения (MAD / Mutually Assured Destruction)</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/736/1*tTl1ler-His0SYeRgDSWCQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Военная доктрина <strong>Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)</strong></figcaption></figure><p><br><strong>   Причина, по которой эта эскроу система работает, очень проста: если хотя бы одна из двух сторон попытается обмануть другую сторону либо будет вести себя некорректно, то сделка не завершается и страховой залог остаётся заблокированным для обоих</strong>.  <strong>Единственный способ для обеих сторон вернуть свой залог обратно - это договориться</strong> так, чтобы все остались довольны в конечном итоге. Только после этого покупатель,  удовлетворившись согласованным решением, отметит транзакцию как завершенную, возвращая автоматически себе страховой залог, а продавцу его залог и оплату. Такой порядок действий часто называют <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction\">Взаимным Гарантированным Уничтожением/Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)</a></strong>.  Это <strong><a href=\"https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2016/09/09/mutually-assured-destruction-game-theory-and-the-cold-war/\">хорошо известная военная доктрина</a></strong>, основанная на теории игр. Теория гласит, что если две страны обладают ядерным оружием, они не будут применять его друг против друга. Причина этого довольно проста - если одна страна запускает ядерную бомбу в сторону другой страны, то практически гарантировано, что и другая страна ответит тем же, так же запустит ядерную бомбу. В конечном итоге обе страны по сути уничтожат друг друга с помощью оружия массового поражения. Другими словами - обе страны в итоге проигрывают, так как обе превращаются в пыль, поэтому эта теория игр и называется <em>Взаимным Гарантированным Уничтожением.</em> </p><p> Эффективность этой теории игр была наглядно продемонстрирована в реальном сценарии во времена Холодной войны, когда и США и СССР сильно угрожали друг другу ядерными боеголовками. Ракеты были явно нацелены на каждую соперничающую страну, но никогда не было инициировано ядерное нападение из-за страха возмездия.</p><h3 id=\"-particl\">Как эта теория связана с эскроу-системой Particl?</h3><p> Двусторонняя система условного депонирования MAD эскроу имеет- это примерно тот же принцип действия, только здесь теория игр вращается вокруг финансовых потерь вместо использования ядерного оружия. Здесь важно понять, что вся теория игр MAD вращается вокруг того факта, что если одна из сторон поведет себя некорректно, то будут наказаны обе вовлеченные стороны. В случае Particl таким сдерживающим фактором является чистая финансовая потеря.  Ни одна из сторон не получит свой залог обратно и, таким образом, оба будут в  убытке если не смогут договориться о решении, приемлемом для обоих. Следовательно - такая теория игр вынудит обе стороны активно работать над достижением взаимноприемлемой договоренности , не привлекая  какого-либо посредника для урегулирования разногласий. Если у них не получится договориться - то оба потеряют деньги, а это никому не нужно. Если же они  достигнут соглашения, то смогут успешно завершить рыночную сделку без уплаты комиссий  (за исключением обычной комиссии как за транзакцию криптовалюты) и без разглашения каких-либо личных или деловых данных какой-либо внешней стороне или посреднику. Эта модель эскроу не только расширяет возможности, но и позволяет с уверенностью утверждать, что ни одна внешняя сторона не будет иметь доступа к информации, которой обмениваются две стороны сделки. Это кардинально меняет правила игры, особенно для цепочек поставок и деликатных бизнес-сделок, когда ни один из участников не хочет, чтобы какая-либо третья сторона совала свой нос. Здесь не нужно раскрывать реквизиты аккаунта эскроу-агенту , не просматривается история транзакций, не просматривается номер отслеживания доставки либо адрес доставки, переговоры не записываются и т.д. Также и в блокчейне нет ничего отслеживаемого либо как-то идентифицирующего участников.</p><h3 id=\"--3\">Конфиденциальность</h3><p> Вероятно, самой мощной особенностью всего этого эскроу-механизма является тот факт, что все валютные транзакции инициируются с использованием мощного протокола конфиденциальности RingCT. Сам смарт-контракт эскроу работает с использованием приватного протокола Конфиденциальных транзакций/Confidential Transactions (CT), но все входящие и исходящие транзакции в нем выполняются с помощью RingCT.

Вместо всего этого она управляется исключительно всем сообществом ее пользователей, образующих сеть Particl.

Она дает возможность любому человеку, находящемуся в любой точке мира, покупать либо продавать глобально или локально какие либо товары и услуги, физические или цифровые. Торговая площадка не требует регистрации, личной информации, подписки и является бесплатной для использования. Поскольку она полностью децентрализована, то нет ни персонала, ни службы поддержки для разрешения возможных споров между покупателем и продавцом. Однако, это вовсе не означает что не существует никакой системы, обеспечивающей честность сделок. Кроме того, торговая площадка Particl является полностью конфиденциальной по умолчанию, а это означает что нет привязки каких-либо идентификационных данных к кому-либо из ее пользователей.  Например,  все финансовые транзакции, проводимые на торговой площадке, анонимны и скрыты в блокчейне, и, что наиболее важно - невозможно отследить их связь с какими-либо покупками на торговой площадке. Кроме этого, загруженные изображения товаров всегда удаляются из метаданных, а весь обмен данными, связанный с действиями на торговой площадке, включая и обмен сообщениями между пользователями, надежно зашифрован. И наконец, вы также можете подключаться к сети Particl p2p через сеть Tor и, таким образом, пользоваться Particl Marketplace с дополнительным уровнем анонимности.  Другими словами, пользователи торговой площадки настолько анонимны насколько это позволяют самые современные технологии обеспечения конфиденциальности.</p><h3 id=\"--1\"><br>Доверие партнеру</h3><p><br> Однако, сочетание всех упомянутых выше характеристик анонимности и конфиденциальности торговой площадки создает некоторую проблему, когда речь заходит о доверии вашему партнеру по сделке на торговой прощадке (будь-то покупатель или продавец). На традиционных централизованных торговых площадках такой проблемы не существует с точки зрения покупателя - там все продавцы идентифицированы и эти платформы обычно имеют либо “центр разрешения споров”, либо систему эскроу. И это добавляет пользователям уверенности, что их партнер будет вести себя честно.  И это работает.<strong>..<a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/personal-finance/education/top-ebay-scams-14781610\">в большинстве случаев</a>. </strong>Однако торговая площадка Particl полностью децентрализована и конфиденциальна. Это означает что нет никакого персонала, который мог бы решать возможные проблемы и следить за тем, чтобы все стороны сделки были честны друг с другом. Итак, каким образом вы могли бы предотвратить недобросовестное выполнение условий сделки одним из участников, если их личность конфиденциальна и нет никакой центральной власти, которая могла бы наказать плохих парней? Как может покупатель отправить платеж первым, а потом спокойно надеяться, что его товар прибудет в хорошем состоянии, и что  вообще прибудет?  Или - может ли продавец рисковать, отправляя товар до получения предоплаты? Все это сводится к доверию, а доверять незнакомцам в интернете, <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"><strong>особенно использующим передовые технологии конфиденциальност</strong></a><strong>и</strong>, всегда было рискованно и, откровенно говоря - неразумно. </p><p> Именно здесь и вступает в игру инновационная система двустороннего условного депонирования MAD эскроу, разработанная Particl.<br><br></p><h3 id=\"-mad-\">Двусторонняя система условного депонирования MAD эскроу</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qKOA4dOAFeM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><figcaption>Как совершить покупку на торговой площадке</figcaption></figure><p><br> Как и большинство других торговых площадок, Particl Marketplace использует систему эскроу для обеспечения честности участников сделок друг с другом. Основное различие между системой эскроу от Particl и традиционно используемыми системами эскроу заключается в том, что она полностью двустороння, т.е. вам не нужно доверять какой-либо 3-й стороне или посреднику, который выступит гарантом честного выполнения условий сделки как продавцом, так и покупателем. Она также является <strong>бесплатной, конфиденциальной по умолчанию и полностью автоматизированной</strong> между покупателем и продавцом. Это реальный новаторский подход, когда эскроу не требует какого-либо персонала для работы! Во-первых, это значительно повышает конфиденциальность всех участников, гарантируя что все детали транзакций, номера счетов, номера накладных, содержание переговоров и любая другая информация остаются конфиденциальными между двумя сторонами сделки (покупателем и продавцом).   Во вторых, никто не будет взимать с вас плату за свои услуги, так как ни один посредник, например эскроу-агент или персонал службы поддержки пользователей, фактически никакие услуги вам не оказывает.

Затем, как только сторона покупателя подтвердит что сделка была завершена удовлетворительно - страховые залоги возвращаются каждой стороне без какой-либо комиссии, за исключением обычной комиссии за криптовалютную транзакцию.Чтобы наглядно показать как это работает, возьмем пример:  кто-то покупает товар стоимостью 100 долларов с затратами на доставку 10 долларов. Этот покупатель должен внести 220 долларов на смарт контракт эскроу, из которых  110 долларов - это оплата покупаемого товара, включая стоимость доставки, и еще 110 долларов - это страховой  залог, который будет возвращен полностью и без какой-либо комиссии после сделки. Продавец, со своей стороны, должен внести такой же страховой залог как и покупатель, т.е. он должен внести на смарт контракт эскроу такую же сумму в 110 долларов, плюс отправить товар стоимостью 110 долларов( со стоимостью его доставки включительно). Таким образом, каждая из сторон будет иметь по 220 долларов, вовлеченных в процесс.   Эти средства обеих сторон будут оставаться заблокированными в смарт контракте эскроу, пока продавец упакует и отправит заказ, а затем покупатель его получит и оценит - все ли так, как ему обещали.  Довольный покупатель помечает сделку как завершенную и это разблокирует смарт контракт эскроу, после чего покупатель автоматически получит обратно свой страховой залог, а продавец - страховой залог плюс оплату за товар, включая стоимость доставки."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"-mad-mutually-assured-destruction-"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Теория игры взаимного гарантированного уничтожения (MAD / Mutually Assured Destruction)"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":["kg-card","kg-image-card","kg-width-wide","kg-card-hascaption"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"https://miro.medium.com/max/736/1*tTl1ler-His0SYeRgDSWCQ.jpeg","className":["kg-image"],"alt":""},"children":[]},{"type":"element","tagName":"figcaption","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Военная доктрина "},{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)"}]}]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"   Причина, по которой эта эскроу система работает, очень проста: если хотя бы одна из двух сторон попытается обмануть другую сторону либо будет вести себя некорректно, то сделка не завершается и страховой залог остаётся заблокированным для обоих"}]},{"type":"text","value":".  "},{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Единственный способ для обеих сторон вернуть свой залог обратно - это договориться"}]},{"type":"text","value":" так, чтобы все остались довольны в конечном итоге.

Здесь важно понять, что вся теория игр MAD вращается вокруг того факта, что если одна из сторон поведет себя некорректно, то будут наказаны обе вовлеченные стороны. В случае Particl таким сдерживающим фактором является чистая финансовая потеря.  Ни одна из сторон не получит свой залог обратно и, таким образом, оба будут в  убытке если не смогут договориться о решении, приемлемом для обоих. Следовательно - такая теория игр вынудит обе стороны активно работать над достижением взаимноприемлемой договоренности , не привлекая  какого-либо посредника для урегулирования разногласий. Если у них не получится договориться - то оба потеряют деньги, а это никому не нужно. Если же они  достигнут соглашения, то смогут успешно завершить рыночную сделку без уплаты комиссий  (за исключением обычной комиссии как за транзакцию криптовалюты) и без разглашения каких-либо личных или деловых данных какой-либо внешней стороне или посреднику. Эта модель эскроу не только расширяет возможности, но и позволяет с уверенностью утверждать, что ни одна внешняя сторона не будет иметь доступа к информации, которой обмениваются две стороны сделки. Это кардинально меняет правила игры, особенно для цепочек поставок и деликатных бизнес-сделок, когда ни один из участников не хочет, чтобы какая-либо третья сторона совала свой нос.

Los compradores rechazan cada vez más los lugares de compra\nfísicos, como los centros comerciales y las grandes tiendas, optando por acudir\na sitios en Internet. Los analistas del sector prevén que para 2025, las ventas\nonline superarán a los puntos de venta físicos y los dejarán en el pasado para\nsiempre. Aunque los vendedores online deberían alegrarse de esta situación\naparentemente próspera, muchos se preocupan y se preguntan por el mañana.\n\nLa venta online es un sector muy competitivo, ya que los titanes del comercio\nminorista se enfrentan a los pequeños vendedores. Amazon, eBay, Alibaba, Rakuten\ny otros recopilan datos de ventas antes de interpretarlos con algoritmos. Esto\nles ayuda a identificar los productos más demandados, quién es probable que los\ncompre y qué productos ofrecen el mejor rendimiento de las inversiones. Una vez\nque se determinan esos productos, aquí es donde la cosa se pone fea.\n\nEl Monopolio de Datos de Amazon\nAmazon alberga actualmente más de 5 millones de vendedores en su mercado. Se\npodría pensar que con cifras así, estarían contentos de cobrar un porcentaje de\nlos aproximadamente 100.000 millones de dólares ganados por esos vendedores en\n2018. Sin embargo, los miles de millones de beneficios anuales y las exenciones\nde impuestos federales no son suficientes para satisfacer al gigante —Amazon\nquiere tus tarifas, tu negocio y que te quedes fuera del juego. \n\nComo vendedor, encontrar el nicho adecuado para tu gama de productos es el pan\nde cada día. Todo el trabajo que se necesita para encontrar ese nicho significa\ninnumerables horas dedicadas a la investigación de mercado, la divulgación y el\nperfeccionamiento de tu negocio a través de pruebas y errores. Amazon, en\ncambio, ya va tres pasos por delante de ti. Sus algoritmos ultra rápidos\nescanean perpetuamente miles de millones de conjuntos de datos que flotan en\nInternet para identificar tendencias. Las técnicas de análisis predictivo\nderivadas de sus millones de usuarios diarios les proporcionan un vasto tesoro\nde información utilizado para identificar las tendencias emergentes. \n\nDicho todo lo anterior, el impulso del mercado de Amazon está incorporado—saben\nlo que un comprador va a comprar antes de que el comprador lo haga, y el barco\nsigue navegando. La centralización del poder minorista de Amazon se ve agravada\npor sus bolsas de dinero sin fondo —pueden permitirse no escatimar en gastos\npara reunir a las mentes más brillantes para construir sus herramientas de\nanálisis de datos y de IA. El resultado es un clásico círculo vicioso, como\ndescribe Kai-Fu Lee, un especialista en IA:\n\n> \"Cuantos más datos tengas, mejor será tu producto; cuanto mejor sea tu producto,\nmás datos podrás recoger; cuantos más datos puedas recoger, más talento podrás\natraer; cuanto más talento puedas atraer, mejor será tu producto\".  —Kai-Fu Lee\n[https://www.feedbackexpress.com/amazon-1029528-new-sellers-year-plus-stats/]\nEl Plan de cómo Amazon Destruye las Empresas\nAmazon, entre otros mercados, posee todos los datos que necesita para\nconvertirse en el vendedor online de mayor éxito. Utiliza su enorme poder para\nfabricar copias de los artículos más vendidos o más rentables bajo su marca.\nTambién se dirige con precisión a los compradores con anuncios y sugerencias de\nproductos copiados. Y quizás la más efectiva y desagradable de las prácticas,\ntoma el listado del vendedor del que copió el producto y lo coloca muy abajo en\nla lista de resultados. ¿Eras un vendedor exitoso con artículos que rozaban la\nsección superior de la primera página? Pues bien ¡ya no! Disfruta de la página 5\no 6. Todas estas prácticas garantizan que Amazon se quede con el pastel y se lo\ncoma también, a la vez que socava gravemente el éxito de sus propios vendedores.\n\nAunque el uso de las plataformas gigantes de venta al por menor puede ser\nconveniente, están seleccionando los datos vitales de tu negocio y utilizándolos\npara competir directamente contra ti —todo ello mientras tu pagas sus elevadas\ntarifas de vendedor. Que quede claro que a los vendedores no solo les roban sus\nideas e inventos, sino que pagan a Amazon para que haga toda la investigación y\nlas pruebas de penetración en el mercado por ellos.\n\nLa eficiencia del mercado es una cosa, pero la dictadura del mercado es otra. El\nmonopolio de datos de Amazon es como un agujero negro en el centro del universo\ndel comercio electrónico—nada escapa a su atracción. Al no haber competencia\nreal, Amazon no tiene rival para dictar las tendencias y dar vueltas a su\nnegocio.\n\nLa Eliminación de los Minoristas Independientes\nAmazon tiene acceso ilimitado a los análisis del vendedor y del comprador, a\npesar de hacer muy pocas menciones a la recopilación de datos en sus términos y\ncondiciones. Imagina que tienes acceso a una cantidad incalculable de\ninformación sobre el producto exacto que estas poniendo en el mercado. Con el\n\"quién\", el \"qué\", el \"cuándo\" y el \"dónde\" ordenados, tendrías una gran\nventaja. Con la capacidad adicional de dejar a la competencia fuera de juego, te\nconvertirías en un dios omnisciente de la venta al por menor— como Amazon.\n\nCada vez que se realiza una venta, todos los datos asociados a ella se agrupan y\nanalizan para obtener información procesable. Amazon examina tanto las\nmicrotendencias como las macrotendencias, el rendimiento de los productos a lo\nlargo del tiempo y los ingresos estimados. Recuerda que todos estos cálculos\nestán automatizados mediante algoritmos y utilizan los hábitos de gasto de los\nclientes en tiempo real y los datos de la competencia. Estos datos dibujan una\nimagen de tus artículos que permite a Amazon saber si tu producto en particular\nestá listo para ser copiado.\n\nLas probabilidades de que tu producto sea señalado aumentan cuanto más popular\neste sea. Aunque esto normalmente haría saltar de alegría a un minorista, se ha\nconvertido en un motivo de preocupación. Tener un producto exitoso significa que\nes casi seguro que este reaparecerá a un precio menor bajo la marca Amazon\nBasics Brand—un nombre que suena bien, pero que oculta la pesadilla en la que se\nha convertido para los vendedores.\n\nDescentralización del Mercado Mundial\nEl tema mencionado en este artículo no sólo habla de la falta de privacidad en\nel comercio electrónico tradicional, sino también de los problemas introducidos\npor las autoridades centrales omnipotentes.\n\nBlockchain ha dado al mundo una nueva forma de intercambiar valor y realizar\nnegocios sin depender de ningún intermediario. Es nada menos que un cambio de\nparadigma económico. La importancia de este cambio tiene que ver con la\nautonomía original. En un paradigma financiero centralizado, no tienes más\nremedio que confiar en la gran variedad de instituciones creadas para ofrecerte\nuna opción —utilizarlas.\n\nEl paradigma descentralizado que hace posible blockchain es lo contrario. Tú\neres el actor principal de tu propio universo financiero. La cadena de bloques\nes un hilo que te conecta directamente con tus compañeros—haciendo que el\nintermediario sea inútil en el proceso.  Claramente, la cadena de bloques es el\nvehículo perfecto para lanzar un mercado global que es a la vez descentralizado\ny totalmente confiable. ¿Suena demasiado bien para ser verdad? Bueno, esto es\npor que es así.\n\nEl problema también es lo que hace que la blockchain sea tan buena para otras\naplicaciones: es un ledger visible públicamente que registra permanentemente\ntodos los datos de transacciones que pasan por su sistema. En un ledger público\ntodas tus transacciones son visibles, como si estuvieran bajo el sol en un día\ndespejado. Un mercado que utilice una cadena de bloques pública sería \nhttps://www.technologyreview.com/s/611425/its-time-to-rein-in-the-data-barons/ \nhaciendo un enorme favor a Amazon y a otros minoristas de primer orden: tendrán\nuna visión más nítida del sector minorista y obtendrán aún más datos.\n\nAdemás, como los tiburones que huelen la sangre a kilómetros de distancia, los\nmineros de datos han comenzado a asignar recursos a la cadena de bloques,\nformando grupos de análisis que están obteniendo grandes cantidades de capital\nde riesgo (además de algunos contratos gubernamentales). Los grupos de análisis\nde la cadena de bloques se especializan en relacionar los datos del libro mayor\ncon las identidades o tendencias de los usuarios. A medida que evolucionan las\nnormas de cumplimiento en torno a la criptomoneda, las empresas de análisis de\nla cadena de bloques desempeñarán un papel clave en la recopilación y el\nanálisis de sus datos.\n\nEn resumen, las plataformas de comercio electrónico centralizadas como Amazon y\nlos mercados descentralizados tienen suficientes problemas serios como para que,\ncomo vendedor, te sientas desesperado. Sin embargo, no te preocupes—hay una\nnueva plataforma de comercio electrónico que protege tus datos, tus productos y\ntu medio de vida.\n\nParticl's Marketplace—Privacidad por Defecto y Verdadera Descentralización\nParticl Marketplace es 100% descentralizado y privado. Para acabar con el mal\nuso de los datos de una vez por todas, el equipo de Particl se unió para\nconstruir un mercado totalmente descentralizado y privado. La descentralización\nes el camino a seguir, pero necesita un ingrediente clave para prosperar\nrealmente en las aplicaciones de comercio electrónico —la privacidad.\n\nParticl cuenta con las muchas ventajas asociadas a la cadena de bloques, pero\nañade algo que ningún otro mercado puede reclamar: transacciones privadas por\ndefecto y sin rastro de datos. Las transacciones privadas por defecto significan\nque sólo tu sabes lo que vendes. Ya no se recolectaran tus valiosos datos y se\nutilizarán para rebajar los precios más adelante. Ya no tienes que preocuparse\nde que una IA \"que todo lo ve\" esté vigilando tu cuenta y esperando a que haga\nun estudio de mercado.\n\nParticl te da la ventaja y la libertad necesarias para ser finalmente el\nvendedor que te has propuesto ser.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
