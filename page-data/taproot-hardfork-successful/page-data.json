A bit earlier today, on this 1st of February, 2022, the\nParticl blockchain has successfully hardforked and activated Taproot!\n\nThe hardfork also includes other items such as a fix to the dynamic marketplace\nlisting fees, the addition of dynamic supply (the blockchain adjusts its\ncirculating supply whenever PART gets burned), and an improvement to the SMSG\nnetwork which allows for more messages to be funded from a single transaction.\n\nTo see the first post-hardfork block (#1,113,123) , check out this link\n[https://explorer.particl.io/block/3c32fe749dbd6d1f50254d966dc2248d621ffc603beee8b52481a6bcb63082db]\n.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat's New?\nWhile this hardfork mostly improves protocol-level components and back-end\nprocesses, it brings the ability for Particl applications (i.e., Particl\nMarketplace [https://particl.news/marketplace], BasicSwap\n[https://particl.news/introducing-particls-basicswap-dex/]) to gain more privacy\nand cost smaller transaction fees.\n\nTaproot—More Privacy, Less Fees\nTaproot introduces many new features and capabilities, notably in the area of\nprivacy and output management. It improves the privacy and fees of Particl\napplications like Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap due to the better processing\nof their complex transactions. You can learn more about Taproot by following \nthis link [https://river.com/learn/what-is-taproot/].\n\nIncrease the maximum size of data outputs\nThis improvement to the SecureMessaging (SMSG) network allows for more\ndata-containing messages to be broadcast (paid messages) per single transaction,\nmaking the P2P network more efficient.\n\nFixing Dynamic Marketplace Listing Fees\nOn Particl, any staker can influence the size of the listing fees on\napplications like Particl Marketplace. By setting up fee targets, they can\nbroadcast to the rest of the network that they want listing fees on Particl\nMarketplace to be either higher or lower.\n\nHowever, the feature that allows for this ability had been broken ever since\nreaching a certain target value. In fact, at some point in the past, the fee\ntarget amount dropped below a particular threshold and the code didn't allow it\nto change anymore (up or down). This hardfork fixed that issue by clamping the\nminimum amount it can change to 1 sat, making the feature functional and\nallowing stakers to adjust listing fees again. Check out this blog post\n[https://particl.news/adjusting-marketplace-listing-fees/] to learn how you can\nhelp reduce the marketplace listing fees.\n\nAdding Dynamic Supply\nThis new feature reduces the money supply whenever outputs are burned. This\neffectively adjusts the total supply based on the number of coins that get\nburned. This prevents staking rewards to be generated based on a supply value\nthat still counts burned coins. It also ensures a correctly adjusted and dynamic\nstaking emission rate. This feature is intended for future use.\n\nRe-enabling disabled outputs\nThe hardfork also re-enabled a small number of disabled outputs from people who\nhad missed the previous deadline. If you still have disabled outputs and haven’t\nput up your claim yet, please do so as fast as possible by following the steps\nmentioned here [https://particl.news/output-claim-process-is-live/]. If\napproved, it will be added to the whitelist and will be re-enabled on the next\nhardfork.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

The actual source code will be uploaded\n...\nGitHubparticl [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.1]If\nyou happen to be a newcomer to Particl at all we highly recommend the Particl\nAcademy as your guide and reference book for getting along with Particl\nMarketplace.\n\nOpen Particl Academy [https://academy.particl.io]\n\nNotes\n * Your wallet needs to be unlocked to process buy and sell orders on the\n   marketplace.\n * If you spot any issue, bug, or area of improvement, please report it directly\n   on the Github Issues [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] \n   page.\n * The source code linked to here is not the actual tagged release source code.\n   Please contact the Particl team for source code information. The actual\n   source code will be uploaded and made available after an appropriate interval\n   of time has passed.\n\nAdvanced Start-up\nSometimes, it's helpful to start the application from the terminal, aka command\nline. It gives you additional information about what's happening in the\nbackground and can be useful for troubleshooting issues (if issues you\nencounter).\n\nWindows\n 1. Open \"Windows Explorer\"\n 2. On the installation folder (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\Particl Desktop\\Particl\n    Desktop\") Press [SHIFT⇧]+[MOUSE-RIGHT◳] and choose \"Open command window\n    here\"\n 3. Type the following command including the quotation marks into the terminal\n    and hit [ENTER ↵] \"Particl Desktop.exe\"\n\nMac\n 1. Open \"Terminal\" \n    (e.g. [COMMAND ⌘] + [SPACE] and type terminal > hit [ENTER ↵])\n 2. Type in this command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    /Applications/Particl\\ Desktop.app/Contents/MacOS/Particl\\ Desktop\n\nLinux\n 1. Open a terminal in the folder where you’ve installed the application and\n    type the following command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    ./Particl\\ Desktop\n\nList of Changes\nGeneral\n * The window title now correctly reflects the chain that the application is\n   started with, so as to more readily distinguish between running the\n   application on testnet or mainnet.\n\nMarketplace App\nIncluded here are the changes applied to both the UI of the marketplace, as well\nas the market service, for convenience:\n\n * Fixes an edge case when an order request might fail to be made despite\n   sufficient funds (and utxos) being available.\n * Fixes an order request not being able to be progressed by either buyer or\n   seller after being made, if the seller escrow amount required is 0.\n * Ignores received listing messages if the listing in the message has expired\n   by the time the listing message is processed. This means that the processing\n   of actual, valid listing messages are processed a lot sooner rather than\n   spending time processing messages that are not going to be useful to begin\n   with (i.e., faster time to see messages when joining a market), as well as\n   preventing the unnecessary updating of the \"pending new items\" refresh button\n   count with expired listings.\n * Adjusts the checking of available utxos when publishing listings to a market.\n   This should provide some measure of preventing cases where listings are\n   published without their associated images.\n * Prevents an order status from incorrectly being updated if the buyer attempts\n   to cancel an order in the \"escrow locked\" status but the seller has already\n   completed the escrow transaction and the buyer node simply has not received\n   the updated status message). Previously, the order status was incorrectly\n   updated to the \"cancelled\" status despite the cancellation request failing;\n   the status is now untouched if the cancellation fails.\n * Fixes listing and market images not being correctly removed from the\n   filesystem.\n * Removes the current listings associated with a market as well when a market\n   is un-joined, rather than leaving the listings and waiting for the listing to\n   expire before removing it.\n * Combines the market ID and applicable market key into a single value: rather\n   than needing to copy out 2 values for sharing access to a market, only one\n   value is now needed. The same applies for the market joining: only a single\n   value is needed to be entered, rather than 2 separate values.\n * Removes the 'Edit Product' button and instead places it inside of a separate\n   \"product info\" modal: this is to more clearly distinguish between editing of\n   a product template and a market-specific template (which tends to cause\n   confusion when a market template requires editing but the product template\n   edit action is more visible and tended to be used more readily instead).\n * Changes the displayed graphic and accompanying text when browsing a market\n   with no listings: a different graphic (and text) is now displayed when the\n   blockchain is still syncing, to clearly distinguish why there may be no\n   listings currently available.\n * Re-sends the escrow complete message in addition to the shipping message when\n   a seller re-sends the order status at the shipping step. If the buyer side\n   was missing the escrow complete status message then re-sending the shipping\n   status alone is insufficient to update the buyer status, so both the escrow\n   complete and shipping status messages are resent at the shipping status step.\n * Updates the error to more accurately reflect the reason for failing to\n   publish a listing when the listing itself is successfully published, but one\n   or more images in the listing are not correctly published.\n * Fixes the display of an order item's shipping value to correctly display the\n   actual shipping value used.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs Particl Desktop 3.1.1 fixes various bugs and issues that were encoutered by\nlive users, we invite those users to give this new update a spin and report back\nif any issue still persists (which shouldn't be the case).\n\nWe thank you all in the community for testing Particl Desktop and the\nmarketplace extensively and reporting back.

This allows BasicSwap to coordinate swaps and disseminate\norders throughout the open source network, while sacrificing none of its\nprivacy-first concerns and network resilience. \n\nThis combination effectively positions BasicSwap as the most affordable, secure,\nand anonymous exchange solution currently available in the cryptocurrency\nlandscape. \n\nAn instance of the BasicSwap application, showing some of the decentralized\norder bookBitcoin Cash Integration: Expanding Options for Users\nThe BasicSwap open source community seeks support from the Bitcoin Cash\ncommunity in order to integrate their coin into the ecosystem. This integration\nwould enable Bitcoin Cash users to trade with the existing pool of supported\ncoins, away from centralized exchanges, while offering privacy and security\nbenefits without the need to convert to another token or secondary layer.\n\nLooking ahead, BasicSwap's integration will also allow supported currencies to\nbe used on Particl's decentralized, censorship-resistant marketplace, which has\nbeen operational for over five years. The marketplace revolutionizes crypto's\nuse case for e-commerce, by decentralizing all of its aspects while\nsimultaneously enforcing trust when buying goods and services from unknown\nparties.\n\nAn active listing on the Particl Marketplace, submitted by an anonymous userThis\ncollaboration could ultimately pave the way for a more cash-like crypto future,\nwhere Bitcoin Cash and many other cryptos become increasingly independent from\ncentralized infrastructure, from exchanges to e-commerce applications, and\nbeyond.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

fund donation stake split (still available and\n   adjustable, but now optional and set to 0% by default).\n * Disabling of frozen blinded spends below 200 PART.\n * New checkpoints.\n\nReduced Inflation Rate and Removal of Automatic Treasury Donations\nOn October 20th, 2025, it was announced that the on-chain vote for the Network\nTreasury and Inflation Adjustments proposal (ID #25) had concluded successfully.\nThe proposal was approved by Particl stakers with a 100% approval rate and a\n63.20% quorum.\n\nThis proposal, which sought to remove automatic staking donations to the network\ntreasury and reduce the network's coin emission to a healthier 3.5% annual rate\n(decreasing by 0.5% per year until stabilizing at 1%), takes effect on February\n1st, 2026, at 12:00:00 UTC.\n\nAs such, it is mandatory to download and run the new hardfork-ready core\nreleases to ensure you are staking on a compatible version when the hardfork\noccurs.\n\nCompatible core versions

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
