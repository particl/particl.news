The failed block index is then added to m_failed_blocks — a record of\nfailed blocks maintained by the node — and remains in there even after the block\nindex is removed from the blockchain to prevent DoS issues.\n\nWhen the next valid block is staked, it is assigned the same block index as the\nremoved block index still in m_failed_blocks because the blockchain only\nverifies m_failed_blocks when blocks arrive out of order, not knowing this\nspecific block index is already in use.\n\nThus, after the node processes a group of blocks following an invalid block, it\ndetects a false positive in m_failed_blocks and refuses to follow the valid\nchain, instead spawning a new fork. As m_failed_blocks only exists in memory\nwhen the node restarts, the chain can sync past that fork.\n\nThis update fixes that issue by properly removing the block index from the \nm_failed_blocks.\n\nHow to Check if my Node was Impacted?\nThe best way to check if your node was impacted is to verify at what block it is\ncurrently staking. If your staking node's current block number matches that of \nParticl's explorer [https://explorer.particl.io], then your node hasn't been\nimpacted.\n\nIf it shows a different block number, then it is likely stuck to an odd fork and\nisn't staking on the right chain anymore. \n\nHow to Fix my Impacted Node(s)?\n * For individual stakers: Simply update your Particl Core version, restart your\n   node, and run the clearbanned command. \n * For staking pools: Update your Particl Core version, run a fresh syncing\n   process in observer mode, then switch to the master branch. \n\n> Note: In some rare cases, you may need to restart your node more than once until\nit syncs back to the correct chain. Running clearbanned should, however, cleanly\nget you back in sync without having to restart your node multiple times.\nWhat's the Impact of this Bug?\nThe impact of this bug would usually be relatively small, preventing affected\nstakers from receiving staking rewards until they get their nodes back in sync.\nUnfortunately, this time the issue happened during an on-chain voting period. \n\nAs a result, we expect this voting round's participation rate to be\nsignificantly lower than what we typically see in other votes because a number\nof large nodes and one staking pool were knocked off the network momentarily.\n\nStill, the current vote is already well over the required participation rate\nthreshold, meaning that its outcome won't be negatively impacted by this bug.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always and especially this time, we strongly recommend updating your Particl\nCore node(s) as soon as possible. Although this issue may be very rare, it does\nimpact the stability of the network and gets more problematic when on-chain\nvoting rounds are ongoing.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

href=\"https://twitter.com/particl_page/status/1561454904425623552?s=21&#x26;t=MKjkbzbCEsrkWC3w8O-TZQ\">one staking pool</a>, were knocked off the network and thrown into a fork.</p><p>Typically, Particl Core functions so that a block index is added for an invalid block to prevent nodes from trying to redownload the same block from other peers. The failed block index is then added to <code class=\"language-text\">m_failed_blocks</code> — a record of failed blocks maintained by the node — and remains in there even after the block index is removed from the blockchain to prevent DoS issues.</p><p>When the next valid block is staked, it is assigned the same block index as the removed block index still in <code class=\"language-text\">m_failed_blocks</code> because the blockchain only verifies <code class=\"language-text\">m_failed_blocks</code> when blocks arrive out of order, not knowing this specific block index is already in use.</p><p>Thus, after the node processes a group of blocks following an invalid block, it detects a false positive in <code class=\"language-text\">m_failed_blocks</code> and refuses to follow the valid chain, instead spawning a new fork. As <code class=\"language-text\">m_failed_blocks</code> only exists in memory when the node restarts, the chain can sync past that fork.</p><p><strong>This update fixes that issue by properly removing the block index from the <code class=\"language-text\">m_failed_blocks</code>.</strong></p><h2 id=\"how-to-check-if-my-node-was-impacted\">How to Check if my Node was Impacted?</h2><p>The best way to check if your node was impacted is to verify at what block it is currently staking. If your staking node's current block number matches that of <a href=\"https://explorer.particl.io\">Particl's explorer</a>, then your node hasn't been impacted.</p><p>If it shows a different block number, then it is likely stuck to an odd fork and isn't staking on the right chain anymore. </p><h2 id=\"how-to-fix-my-impacted-node-s-\">How to Fix my Impacted Node(s)?</h2><ul><li><strong>For individual stakers:</strong> Simply update your Particl Core version, restart your node, and run the <code class=\"language-text\">clearbanned</code> command. </li><li><strong>For staking pools: </strong>Update your Particl Core version, run a fresh syncing process in observer mode, then switch to the master branch. </li></ul><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> In some rare cases, you may need to restart your node more than once until it syncs back to the correct chain. Running <code class=\"language-text\">clearbanned</code> should, however, cleanly get you back in sync without having to restart your node multiple times.</blockquote><h2 id=\"what-s-the-impact-of-this-bug\">What's the Impact of this Bug?</h2><p>The impact of this bug would usually be relatively small, preventing affected stakers from receiving staking rewards until they get their nodes back in sync. Unfortunately, this time the issue happened during an on-chain voting period. </p><p>As a result, we expect this voting round's participation rate to be significantly lower than what we typically see in other votes because a number of large nodes and one staking pool were knocked off the network momentarily.</p><p>Still, the current vote is already well over the required participation rate threshold, meaning that its outcome won't be negatively impacted by this bug.</p><hr><p>As always and especially this time, we strongly recommend updating your Particl Core node(s) as soon as possible. Although this issue may be very rare, it does impact the stability of the network and gets more problematic when on-chain voting rounds are ongoing.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

powerful shakeup blockchain\ntechnologies brought to the internet means a lot more room for novel ideas of\norganization in this sphere. The advent of distributed autonomous organizations\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization] is a prime\nexample; while still in their early stages, DAOs lay the groundwork for\npolitical systems that are more compatible than ever with open-source products\nand services - especially truly disruptive, dissident applications of these new\ntechnologies.\n\nA decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), as we know, is a community made\nup of a multitude of participants, which functions according to the rules of\ngovernance inscribed in smart contracts as well as a democratic process of\nengagement. Management of those organizations is decentralized and democratic:\ndecisions that need to be made are made by stakeholders via an auditable,\ndistributed public vote. That is the case, for example, with the Particl\nprivacy-centric protocol, which concluded its latest development funding vote\nthis week [https://particl.news/team-funding-request-3-results/].\n\nSovereignty and Disruptive Technology\nPolitical thinker Carl Schmitt is well known for his articulation of the\n“Ausnahmezustand”, or “state of exception”, as well as its varied political\nimplications.\n\nSometimes defined as an emergency provision allowing a given government to\nsuspend the rule of law (such as martial law, or the french état de siège),\nSchmitt’s theory of Ausnahmezustand actually cuts deeper: at a deeper level,\nwhoever decides on this state of exception, or is in a position to deem it to\nexist and to remedy to it, can ultimately be defined as the “true sovereign\".\nAll other structures of power involved - whether it be a state government, a\nsupranational entity, or the governance of an organization such as Tornado Cash\n- ultimately fall under the remit of this “true sovereignty”. This has powerful,\nbroad implications; particularly on communities and projects that threaten the\ninterests, or even the existence, of genuinely sovereign power structures.\n\nOf course, a truly disruptive technology or service isn’t abstractly disruptive:\nit is disruptive with respect to a concrete power structure – oftentimes state\npower, endowed with powerful means to preserve its integrity. Such was the case\nwith the recent Tornado Cash debacle\n[https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/08/crypto-mixing-service-tornado-cash-blacklisted-by-us-treasury/]\n, a crypto mixer that became so disruptive to American national interests as to\nforce the U.S. Treasury Department to flex some of its most powerful tools to\nnearly instantly crush it out of existence. One of its main developers, Alexey\nPertsev, was arrested, jailed, and even denied bail\n[https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/24/alleged-tornado-developer-pertsev-must-stay-in-jail-dutch-judge-rules/] \nin the Netherlands, thousands of miles away from the White House. While it may\nbe too late for Tornado Cash to ever come back from this blow, several lessons\ncan be learned from this.\n\nMoving Forward: Divide AND Rule\nWhat can we learn of such a conditional governance, a governance that functions\nbecause it is allowed to? Ausnahmezustand, we can see, invokes a powerful\nparadox - but even Schmitt could not possibly have predicted the political\nrealities that offer themselves to us today.\n\nWhile still in their infancy, encrypted and truly distributed blockchain-era\ntechnologies — and the political structures they make possible — reveal\nthemselves as powerful alternatives to traditional governance. This is\nespecially true for organizations that threaten the power structures at work\nwithin the political spheres they are bound to; examples include dissident media\nentities, gray marketplace environments, currency exchange platforms, or even\nfile sharing platforms and protocols. For those rebels, distributed and\nanonymous decision making, file hosting and communications become shielded from\nthe potentially dire consequences of their resistance.\n\nWithout the unique aspects of DAOs - specifically its distributed nature, its\nprivate and pseudonymous aspects, and its utmost resistance to censorship - this\n“true sovereign” of any truly disruptive product or organization must by\ndefinition be unaccountable. This is because they either must be cloaked in\ntotal obscurity, being obligated to expertly hide themselves from power in order\nto subsist, or ultimately fall prey to the interests of higher powers.\nDistributed sovereignty, in this context, flips the old adage: divide AND rule,\nbut on the terms of the many instead of the few.\n\nDistributed Rule: A Future of Possibilities\nPrinciples of liberty, free access to information, freedom of association, and\nopen source technologies come together in such a radically distributed system of\ngovernance. With a lot of room to grow, decentralized autonomous organizational\nstructures have enormous potential to radically redefine the structuring of\neconomic activities and, at the same time, major economic, financial, and even\nlegal issues — the exploration of which has only just begun.\n\n\n\nIf you want to learn more about the revolutionary decentralized ecosystem we're\nbuilding at Particl, and if you want to contribute to the growth of online\nprivacy and liberties, then come join our awesome global community of\ncypherpunks on Discord [https://discord.me/particl], Telegram\n[https://t.me/particlOn], or Element\n[https://matrix.to/#/%23particl-project:matrix.org] — or just give one of our\ndecentralized and privacy-first apps a try here [https://particl.io/].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJoin the discussion\nWhat's your stance?

Since then, we’ve mainly\nworked on improving Particl Marketplace and Desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases] and getting BasicSwap\nready for its open beta launch\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commits/master].\n\nBasicSwap — The Fully Private Cross-Chain DEXMatch and settle cryptocurrency\ntrades in a trustless setup without any central point of failure or fee.Particl\nNewscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/]Here’s a\nbrief list of releases we’ve delivered since the start of the second funding\ncycle.\n\n * BasicSwap open beta launch (imminent\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/])\n * Successful Taproot hardfork (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/taproot-hardfork-successful/])\n * Particl Electrum release (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/particl-electrum-now-available/])\n * Six (6) Particl Desktop releases (check it out\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases])\n * Seven (7) Particl Core releases (check it out\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases])\n * Particl Core 23.x latest version (check it out\n   [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases])\n * Particl Marketplace messaging system (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-2-live-on-mainnet/])\n\nRoadmap Progress\nWe’ve also made steady progress on the completion of various development\nroadmap\nitems [https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/]. Here are the ones we’ve\ncompleted or made significant progress with during the past six months.\n\nMajor Milestones\nBasicSwap DEX We're now very close to releasing the long-anticipated open beta\nof BasicSwap, along with a user-friendly user interface. We've also massively\nimproved the DEX codebase, making it easier to use and faster to get started\nwith. \n\nAt the time of this writing, we are running a final round of tests on the\ncurrently available features and functions, as well as on the app's GUI. Once\nthat is completed and all potential issues are resolved, we will begin a final\nround of tests within our closed beta group, after which we will launch the open\nbeta. \n\nWeb framework We've made progress on the incremental deployment of an early web\nframework, notably by releasing the Particl.Store [https://www.particl.store] \ndemo. \n\nAlthough this may seem like a small step, this gateway uses a different and\nimproved marketplace codebase than Particl Desktop. It improves the coding\nefficiency and allows for greater compatibility with external access gateways —\na critical capability moving forward with Particl's next evolutionary phase. \n\nBlockchain and Coin\nConstant blockchain updates and improved zap functionality As usual, we've made\ncountless improvements to Particl Core, always keeping it up-to-date with the\nrecent versions of Bitcoin. As you can see here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master], this is no small task. \n\nNotably, we've improved its staking zap functionality by allowing for a more\ncustomizable process management. You can now choose between two zapping options;\noptimized for staking revenue or optimized for maximum privacy. \n\nParticl Electrum Back in March, we've released the Particl Electrum light wallet\n[https://particl.news/particl-electrum-now-available/]. It provides light\nblockchain services to the ecosystem on both desktop and mobile devices. \n\nParticl Electrum is expected to play a useful role in usability with the\necosystem's upcoming evolutionary phase, allowing dApps and services to connect\nto and use Particl Blockchain without having to sync it fully. \n\nTaproot Support On February 1st, the Particl Blockchain successfully hardforked to enable the\nTaproot protocol improvement [https://particl.news/taproot-hardfork-successful/]\n. Taproot is a major upgrade for Particl Blockchain, allowing for more complex\nsmart-contracts, cheaper transactions, and better privacy and scalability. \n\nMarketplace\nMessaging system During this funding cycle, the most significant feature update\nto Particl Marketplace has been the addition of a decentralized messaging system\nin which sellers, buyers, and potential buyers can discuss. \n\nThis is a critical functionality, especially when issues require to be resolved\nbefore both parties agree to finalize an escrowed marketplace transaction. \n\nProduct codes Product codes attach a unique ID to listing templates, allowing\nfor better inventory management and more efficient use of external platforms. \n\nThis feature update already embraces Particl's new modular approach by allowing\nindividual marketplace listings to interact with outside \"modules\" (i.e.,\nthird-party cross-platform inventory management system). \n\nA ton of general improvements Aside from the two feature updates mentioned\nabove, a large number of general additions, improvements, and bug fixes have\nbeen added to Particl Marketplace and the desktop application. Because there is\nway too much to mention here, we invite you to check out the full list of\nchanges available here [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/]. \n\nDesktop\nMultiple Particl Desktop improvements As part of the upcoming Particl Desktop\n3.3 release, we've begun incrementally separating Particl Core from Particl\nDesktop. \n\nAlthough it used to be a singular roadmap item at the time of the previous\nfunding cycle, this process has now become part of a wider ecosystem upgrade\nwhich we announced earlier this week here\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/]. \n\nMore user configurability We've been working, also as part of the upcoming\nParticl Desktop 3.3 release, on better client user configuration. This will give\nusers more options and control over their Particl experience. This improvement\nis partly related to the previous item regarding Core and Desktop separation and\nis a step forward in the context of Particl's upcoming new development cycle. \n\nMajor dependencies update and general improvements Throughout the second funding\ncycle, we've made a major dependencies update and applied a large number of code\nimprovements, bug fixes, and tweaks to the desktop client. You can see every\naddition to Particl Desktop by following this link\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/]. \n\nThe Announcement of Particl's Next Evolutionary Leap Forward\nOn the 2nd of August, 2022, we published the major announcement of Particl's\nnext evolutionary phase.\n\nParticl’s Next Evolutionary Leap ForwardLearn about the team’s new major\ndevelopment cycle and discover Particl’s upcoming open-source foundation for\nthe\ndevelopment and deployment of privacy-first dApps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/]The announced\ndevelopment cycle will be the biggest evolution of the Particl ecosystem since\nthe project's inception in 2017.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
