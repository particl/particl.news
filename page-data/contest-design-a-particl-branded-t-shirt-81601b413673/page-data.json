His\ngoal was to tap into the video blog genre to help promote Particl, as well as\nprivacy rights, decentralized ecommerce and financial freedom (individual\nsovereignty).\n\nWe are excited to bring Desi-Rae on to exclusively cover Particl and also\nsupport her research into other benefits blockchain tech and the space can lead\nus in the future.\n\nI had a chance to ask her some questions about her background and passions\nrecently.\n\nPS: You have an academic process by how you learn and then present your content.\nWhat is your background?\n\nDRC: My background is in scientific research and data collection, as well as\nvisual art, specifically oil painting. I studied Biology and Studio Arts in\nschool and have always been interested in many things and the process of\nlearning itself. As you can possibly tell from my videos, I enjoy encountering\nsomething new and then finding out more about it, particularly by doing research\nthat provides data to answer a question. But I am also interested in the\naesthetic environment of a presentation, in terms of visuals, tone and mood, and\nnot only the presentation of the actual information.\n\nPS: How did you get into the cryptocurrency space?\n\nDRC: I got into the cryptocurrency space through osmosis. I knew and followed\npeople who were interested in cryptocurrency. I had a minimal amount of interest\nin the technology behind it. This is in the sense that I like to understand how\nthe world around me works, and not be ignorant of the basic functioning of many\nthings that I come to rely upon and use. However, I may not know how to build\nsomething myself. I was also drawn into the cryptocurrency space through the\nappeal of investing long term for financial gain, something which is in some\nways barred from individuals who are not already in the financial world due to\nhow the law handles those kinds of scenarios.\n\nPS: What type of content do you want to bring to the Particl community and the\ncryptocurrency space in general?\n\nDRC: I want to bring content to the cryptocurrency space that makes people\ncurious, engaged, and hopefully enthusiastic about cryptocurrency. There is a\nlot of content available for anyone who wants to learn. Really, there are video\nseries and lectures, from any standpoint, such as knowing how to code,\nunderstanding how blockchains or features of a cryptocurrency work, figuring out\nhow to trade or invest, and so on. Anything. Anyone can learn anything. So, my\ninterest is in shaping how a person can interact within that space, with the\npersonalities involved and the way they receive that information. And I think my\nbigger focus would be on understanding concepts rather than the full details,\nand just having a line of communication between the official project and the\ncommunity at large or potential supporters or contributors.\n\nPS: Do you think privacy is important?\n\nDRC: With an emphatic yes, I think that privacy is very important. I possibly\ncouldn’t stress enough how much. People will pay a premium amount of money to\nhave their own space and have thicker walls in an apartment building. A person\ndoes not speak the same way in a space depending who is around. Why do we need\nto dance alone in our rooms before dancing in front of a crowd? Why are ballots\nusually secret? It’s important to be able to reflect in one’s own time too.\nPrivacy is an extension of self-ownership, to have the ability to choose how\nmuch one shares about themselves, their thoughts and feelings. As it relate to\ncryptocurrency, a privacy focused project such as Particl brings back privacy to\nan increasingly public space, due to the power of technology and the current\nneed for people in the background to make things run smoothly as one uses their\nproduct and services, such as services that help us manage our finances or\nparticipate in the global marketplace.\n\nPS: What excites you about Particl the most?\n\nDRC: This isn’t something that I really knew before, but Particl was started by\na group of people who decided to work on something together, as opposed to an\nalready established institution funding a project. I think a great thing is when\npeople see a problem, and try to solve it, or have an idea, and get to work on\nit. I know what Particl is doing in terms of implementing privacy technology is\ncool, for lack of a better word, but I think it’s even cooler that people found\na way to put their skillsets together and create a community around an idea. I\nalso think in terms of seeing an issue with marketplaces such as how centralized\nthey are, or the lack of privacy in financial dealings in general as we rely on\nbanks, it is good to actually find a path independent of simply complaining\nabout how others are not doing it the right way.\n\nPS: How did you get into doing video blogs?\n\nDRC: I got into doing video blogs first as a way to share my artwork with\nothers, bring visibility to myself, and communicate with people who were fans of\nmy work. I then also began to share my voice with others on topics I thought\nwere important as I felt the social and political climate around me shifting.\nOvertime, I found fulfillment in connecting with others through common\ninterests. I now appreciate the gift of being able to communicate with others in\na way that I did not before I was making video blogs.\n\nPS: It is nice hearing someone explain they are still learning about technology\nwhile they are also presenting it. Do you think you are just beginning,\nsomewhere in the middle or a certified blockchain expert regarding crypto?\n\nDRC: I am definitely just beginning regarding crypto and understanding\nblockchain technology! I could perhaps describe myself as an amateur. I have a\nrudimentary understanding of cryptography. I think it will be insightful and\ninteresting for people to see my development and follow along as I learn.\n\nDesi-Rae will continue building her new channel CryptoRamble\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCphRdyvqdktDRm0ruPqPRJA] on YouTube with\nParticl deep-dives and educational pieces on blockchain solutions. While she’s\nexclusive to Particl we also want to tap into the audience in the space still\nlearning.\n\nWe expect her to look deeper into blockchain trends like storage, platform\ntokens, as well as, features that are Particl core values like privacy and\nsecurity.\n\nCurrency-agnosticism is also part of our DNA so don’t be alarmed to see Desi-rae\ntalking about other privacy coins or decentralized marketplaces. While she won’t\ndo full segments on specific coins (don’t even ask ?) she will touch on\nprojects taking different approaches to this huge ecosystem just beginning to be\nbuilt.\n\nShe’s going to bring a valuable educational piece to our project and the space\nand we are excited to support that.

As it relate to cryptocurrency, a privacy focused project such as Particl brings back privacy to an increasingly public space, due to the power of technology and the current need for people in the background to make things run smoothly as one uses their product and services, such as services that help us manage our finances or participate in the global marketplace."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"PS: What excites you about Particl the most?"}]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"DRC: "}]},{"type":"text","value":"This isn’t something that I really knew before, but Particl was started by a group of people who decided to work on something together, as opposed to an already established institution funding a project. I think a great thing is when people see a problem, and try to solve it, or have an idea, and get to work on it. I know what Particl is doing in terms of implementing privacy technology is cool, for lack of a better word, but I think it’s even cooler that people found a way to put their skillsets together and create a community around an idea. I also think in terms of seeing an issue with marketplaces such as how centralized they are, or the lack of privacy in financial dealings in general as we rely on banks, it is good to actually find a path independent of simply complaining about how others are not doing it the right way."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"PS: How did you get into doing video blogs?"}]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"DRC: "}]},{"type":"text","value":"I got into doing video blogs first as a way to share my artwork with others, bring visibility to myself, and communicate with people who were fans of my work.
