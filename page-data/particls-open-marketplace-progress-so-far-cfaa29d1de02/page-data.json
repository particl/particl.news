As we are jumping into\nthis new decade with both feet\n[https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819], it’s time to\nget serious about the adoption of the marketplace. As such, the Particl team has\ncrafted a new and pretty extensive development roadmap that specifically focuses\non bringing what needs to be brought for Particl’s marketplace to be considered\n“adoption-ready”.\n\nBut before getting into it, let’s make sure we understand where the Particl\nmarketplace currently stands — what are its strengths and unique offerings, how\nfar has it come since being released, and what prevents it from getting adopted\nby more users. Once that is understood, it then becomes easier to wrap our heads\naround what needs to be done moving forward to make sure the marketplace gets\nthe success it quite frankly deserves.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat Makes Particl’s Marketplace Unique?\nParticl’s Open Marketplace is most definitely a unique offering in the eCommerce\nindustry, even still to this day. It allows online sellers and buyers to connect\ndirectly with each other, without requiring any sort of middleman assistance\n(i.e. a company operating an online marketplace), and conduct business without\nthe usual costs associated with selling and buying online such as transaction\nfees, sales commissions, marketplace subscriptions, currency conversions, and\netc.\n\nAdditionally, the marketplace is also built using various security and\nprivacy-enhancing technologies so that no data (i.e. sales data) or personal\ninformation can be collected by any outside party, a particularly important perk\nin an age where data mining, monetization, breaches, and leaks have become far\ntoo common. Equally as important, better privacy within the eCommerce industry\nundoubtedly leads to better business and competitive practices as well as a more\nfair environment for sellers.\n\nOn top of that combination of near-zero cost and superior data security, the\nmarketplace requires no sign-up, no login, no personal or business information,\nis censorship-proof, free to use, and works from any country in the world, as\nlong as you can connect to the internet.\n\nQuite simply, there is not a single marketplace on the web offering such an\nambitious and novel combination of features. The reason for it is also quite\nsimple to understand — getting this full set of features packaged into a\nmarketplace requires the use of various novel distributed and privacy-preserving\nprotocols that have only recently been made available to developers across the\nworld.\n\nA Novel, Never-Been-Done-Before Concept\nAs a very obvious example of this, let’s take just one component that makes up\nParticl’s marketplace — its automated double deposit escrow system. Particl’s\nescrow system works on smart-contract functionalities and requires a combination\nof RingCT and CT cryptocurrency transactions so that any transaction information\nbetween a buyer and seller remains only known to these two transacting parties.\nIn other words, it makes escrow transactions completely untraceable and\nunlinkable to any party not associated with a particular marketplace\ntransaction.\n\nAnd while RingCT has been available, on Monero, for a few years now, it never\nwas built in a way that it could be used in smart-contracts. Additionally, most\nof the other currently available privacy protocols simply weren’t programmable\n(can’t be used in smart-contracts) or simply weren’t realistically scalable\nenough to make sense to use as part of a marketplace product. For this reason,\nthe Particl team had to build its own custom implementation of RingCT (and\nbulletproofs) so that it could be used by decentralized applications on the\nParticl network, and that’s only been available for a few months.\n\nThis is just one isolated example of technology that became available just\nrecently. Particl’s entire platform is composed of such novel components, and so\nit’s no wonder that there is still no marketplace in existence currently\noffering the same combination of perks as Particl does.\n\nPioneering Takes Time, Efforts, and a Solid Vision\nBut being at the edge of technology also has its drawbacks. After all, Particl’s\nmarketplace is still early Beta software and isn’t really the simplest\nmarketplace to use out there. It really works, but it simply can’t realistically\nbe expected to be adopted by any sort of “mainstream” type of user.\n\nIt does provide many benefits that are very real, but the technical knowledge\nand the learning curve required to even use it is still relatively steep. That’s\none of the biggest obstacles currently standing in Particl’s way when it comes\nto the adoption of the marketplace.\n\nBut rest assured, that is perfectly normal for any new technology that’s as\ngroundbreaking as Particl’s marketplace and uses technologies that have only\nbeen made available for a short time. It takes time to disrupt an industry\nthat’s as competitive as the eCommerce sector, and it also takes time for brand\nnew types of technologies to mature up to the point where most people feel\ncomfortable using it. Remember the advent of the internet in the early '90s?\n\nThe Particl team is indeed well aware of the marketplace’s current lack of\n“mainstream” appeal. Most of the features, functions, and general user\nexperience that would actually be expected from your typical marketplace user\n(think your parents, significant other, or friends that aren’t as “crypto crazy”\nas we all are) are still being built, and they’ve been nicely incorporated into\nthe new Particl 2020 development roadmap.\n\nSome of the additions required to make the marketplace more\n“mainstream-appealing” have already been deployed since first releasing the\nmarketplace on mainnet and can be used by anyone at this very moment. They are\neither features, improvements, or important functions that help make a buyer or\nseller’s life easier. Let’s review what these improvements and additions are and\nsee how has Particl’s marketplace evolved over the last few months.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow Has the Marketplace Evolved Since Launch?\nNot only has the marketplace consistently been pushing its all-time high number\nof listings higher and higher [https://www.demarkets.io/stats], but the number\nof mainnet transactions on the Particl network has also seen a\ndramatic rise [https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/#!overview], now averaging more\nthan 200 transactions per day. These transactions include listed items, escrow\ntransactions, the flagging of items, created and votes on community proposals,\nbalance transfers, and regular currency transactions.\n\nAdditionally, and perhaps even more importantly, the Particl network has been\ngetting much more private! Indeed, the network’s “anon set”, the number of\nRingCT outputs available to anonymize transactions, has been growing\nexponentially since the launch of the Open Marketplace, averaging a steady 30%\nor more increase per month. The anon set currently stands at 5232, a whopping\n149% increase since August 2019. To observe that value goes up and down by\nyourself, just open up your Particl Desktop wallet and type anonoutput in the\nconsole window. As the Open Marketplace and the Particl network gets more\nadoption, you can expect that number to keep rising, meaning RingCT transactions\nwill keep on getting more private.\n\nMore Tools and Features Made Available\nParticl’s Open Marketplace is still Beta software, meaning it is still very much\na work-in-progress and under heavy development. As such, it is normal that some\nof the intended features for its first “final” version are still missing to this\nday. The good thing, though, is that these features and improvements are coming\nup quite quickly!\n\nEver since the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace on the 12th of August,\n2019, we’ve seen these improvements go live…\n\n * Import products (bulk listing)\n\nThis feature allows sellers to import products from outside sources such as .csv\nfiles and WooCommerce stores. It is particularly useful to manage large\ninventories and list items in bulk. This feature is ultimately designed to reach\nits full potential when used in combination with the upcoming Market Management\n[https://particl.news/market-management-is-next-3e35356d5de0] and Inventory\nManagement tools.\n\n * Public comments (Q&A)\n\nThis feature allows anyone to leave a comment, review, feedback, or question on\nany listing posted on the Open Marketplace. Leaving a post notifies the seller\nof the item which can then respond. Posts made by the seller of an item are\nclearly identified as such. This feature is intended to better help you make\nbetter shopping decisions and know more about the items you’re looking to buy. \nPublic comments will tie in nicely with future reputation models intended to be\nimplemented at a later stage during the Beta stage of development.\n\n * Cancel bids\n\nIt used to be impossible to cancel an order before the seller accepted it,\nmeaning funds could get stuck in limbo when sellers were inactive and not\nprocessing orders. While it was possible to manually unlock these coins, it did\nrequire a fair bit of technical knowledge about the Particl platform itself. Far\nfrom ideal! This is why an update was made to the marketplace to add this\nimportant functionality.\n\n * Settings page\n\nThe first iteration of the Settings page has been added a few weeks after the\nlaunch of the Open Marketplace Beta. While it currently only contains basic\nsettings such as notification management and wallet backup options, the Settings\npage will play a bigger role once Market Management and other future major\nfeatures are integrated.\n\n * In-wallet Bitcoin exchange\n\nThis major and exciting update to Particl Desktop added the ability to swap\nBitcoin for Particl right inside the wallet. This means anyone can now “top up”\ntheir Open Marketplace account using Bitcoin. No need to register on an exchange\nor give away your personal information (i.e. KYC, IP address, etc), and it works\neverywhere, even in the US!\n\nThis exchange module is currently powered by the SMSG network and connects\ndirectly to the SimpleSwap [http://simpleswap.io] exchange, but is built in such\na way that it can integrate almost any exchange or service provider as long as\nthe required APIs are provided by the third-party. This update was very\nimportant as it opens the door for Particl to be adopted outside of its own\ncommunity by accepting a varied list of currencies.\n\n * Bot Management\n\nThe Bot Management feature was introduced at the same time as the Bitcoin\nExchange module was. It is, in fact, what powers it. The Bot Management feature\nallows you to use and list SMSG bots that provide added third-party services to\nParticl Desktop. These added services can be bridges to crypto exchanges or fiat\npayment gateways, as well as many other sorts of services.\n\nHowever, because this is the first iteration of the feature, it is currently not\npossible to manually add your bot to the list of available bots. That’s because\nsecurity measures still need to be put in place to make sure people do not push\nmalicious bots on the network. The Bot Management tool is planned to be an\nintegral part of the upcoming developer SDK.\n\n * SMSG improvements\n\nSMSG is the P2P network that powers the Open Marketplace. It securely and\nprivately hosts data (i.e. listing images and descriptions) and makes several\nprocesses possible such as displaying listings, flagging items, exchanging\nBitcoin for Particl, and etc. It is the backbone of the entire Particl\necosystem.\n\nSince the marketplace’s mainnet launch, the SMSG network has seen its\nperformance vastly improved, notably with how effectively it displays listings\nand communicates between peers. Improving SMSG will be an ongoing process as we\nmove forward through the Beta phase of development.\n\n * Significantly reduced listing fees\n\nOne of the big updates that were made to the SMSG network is the ability for\nstakers to signal lower listing fees to the network. What that means is that\nanyone staking on the Particl network can have a say on how much the network\ncharges users for publishing listings on the Open Marketplace.\n\nAs a result, ever since the launch of the Beta, listing fees have been reduced\nby a big fat 53%! This is already great, making it much cheaper for sellers to\nlist items, but fees are also expected to go down even more, by at least 80%, in\nthe next SMSG update. That’s what near-zero cost eCommerce means!\n\n * Various improvements, tweaks, and fixes based on user suggestions\n\nOn top of everything mentioned above, a LOT of tweaks, fixes, and improvements\nhave been made to both the code and the user experience of Particl Desktop and\nthe Open Marketplace. A lot of these changes have been made based on user\nfeedback, and it is the one reason why the “Report bug” button has been added at\nthe bottom left of the Particl Desktop client. All user feedback is very\nimportant and really makes it easier for Particl developers to see what areas\nneed to be improved or tweaked. The more feedback is received, the faster issues\ncan be addressed. For this reason, it is highly recommended to be pro-active in\nreporting issues and making suggestions on Github.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith all of the above in mind, it is clear that Particl’s marketplace is getting\nbetter and easier to use by the day. Of course, there is still some stuff\nmissing or that could be improved, but that’s more than normal given the Beta\nnature of the product.\n\nSo what’s left to do? What is the marketplace missing? What could be improved to\nbe able to attract a wider range of users and make sure they remain users over a\nlonger period of time?\n\nThat’s what we’ll be exploring later this week in a future article published\nhere at Particl.news [http://Particl.news]. These are all questions that the\nteam has asked itself recently, along with a few community contributors, and\nwhich resulted in a brand new (and dare I say…exciting!) development roadmap. \nWatch out for next week, because that’s when the new development roadmap will be\npublicly revealed!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-Progress-So-Far/1-l9wIwdXxGp6dWHRnhXfqPQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"it-s-almost-time-for-particl-to-shine-\">It’s almost time for Particl to shine! ?</h3><p>The Beta version of Particl’s Open Marketplace has been out for a few months now, and it’s been evolving pretty nicely ever since.

As we are <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819\"><strong>jumping into this new decade with both feet</strong></a>, it’s time to get serious about the adoption of the marketplace. As such, the Particl team has crafted a new and pretty extensive development roadmap that specifically focuses on bringing what needs to be brought for Particl’s marketplace to be considered “adoption-ready”.</p><p>But before getting into it, let’s make sure we understand where the Particl marketplace currently stands — what are its strengths and unique offerings, how far has it come since being released, and what prevents it from getting adopted by more users. Once that is understood, it then becomes easier to wrap our heads around what needs to be done moving forward to make sure the marketplace gets the success it quite frankly deserves.</p><hr><h2 id=\"what-makes-particl-s-marketplace-unique\">What Makes Particl’s Marketplace Unique?</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-Progress-So-Far/1-X5zYJtOFQWkVjnOD6Zr_nA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Particl’s Open Marketplace is most definitely a unique offering in the eCommerce industry, even still to this day. It allows online sellers and buyers to connect directly with each other, without requiring any sort of middleman assistance (i.e. a company operating an online marketplace), and conduct business without the usual costs associated with selling and buying online such as transaction fees, sales commissions, marketplace subscriptions, currency conversions, and etc.</p><p>Additionally, the marketplace is also built using various security and privacy-enhancing technologies so that no data (i.e. sales data) or personal information can be collected by any outside party, a particularly important perk in an age where data mining, monetization, breaches, and leaks have become far too common. Equally as important, better privacy within the eCommerce industry undoubtedly leads to better business and competitive practices as well as a more fair environment for sellers.</p><p>On top of that combination of near-zero cost and superior data security, the marketplace requires no sign-up, no login, no personal or business information, is censorship-proof, free to use, and works from any country in the world, as long as you can connect to the internet.</p><p>Quite simply, there is not a single marketplace on the web offering such an ambitious and novel combination of features. The reason for it is also quite simple to understand — getting this full set of features packaged into a marketplace requires the use of various novel distributed and privacy-preserving protocols that have only recently been made available to developers across the world.</p><h3 id=\"a-novel-never-been-done-before-concept\">A Novel, Never-Been-Done-Before Concept</h3><p>As a very obvious example of this, let’s take just one component that makes up Particl’s marketplace — its automated double deposit escrow system. Particl’s escrow system works on smart-contract functionalities and <strong>requires a combination of RingCT and CT cryptocurrency transactions</strong> so that any transaction information between a buyer and seller remains only known to these two transacting parties. In other words, it makes escrow transactions completely untraceable and unlinkable to any party not associated with a particular marketplace transaction.</p><p>And while RingCT has been available, on Monero, for a few years now, it never was built in a way that it could be used in smart-contracts. Additionally, most of the other currently available privacy protocols simply weren’t programmable (can’t be used in smart-contracts) or simply weren’t realistically scalable enough to make sense to use as part of a marketplace product. For this reason, the Particl team had to build its own custom implementation of RingCT (and bulletproofs) so that it could be used by decentralized applications on the Particl network, and that’s only been available for a few months.</p><p>This is just one isolated example of technology that became available just recently. Particl’s entire platform is composed of such novel components, and so it’s no wonder that there is still no marketplace in existence currently offering the same combination of perks as Particl does.</p><h3 id=\"pioneering-takes-time-efforts-and-a-solid-vision\">Pioneering Takes Time, Efforts, and a Solid Vision</h3><p>But being at the edge of technology also has its drawbacks. After all, Particl’s marketplace is still early Beta software and isn’t really the simplest marketplace to use out there. It really works, but it simply can’t realistically be expected to be adopted by any sort of “mainstream” type of user.</p><p>It does provide many benefits that are very real, but the technical knowledge and the learning curve required to even use it is still relatively steep. That’s one of the biggest obstacles currently standing in Particl’s way when it comes to the adoption of the marketplace.</p><p>But rest assured, that is perfectly normal for any new technology that’s as groundbreaking as Particl’s marketplace and uses technologies that have only been made available for a short time. It takes time to disrupt an industry that’s as competitive as the eCommerce sector, and it also takes time for brand new types of technologies to mature up to the point where most people feel comfortable using it. Remember the advent of the internet in the early '90s?</p><p>The Particl team is indeed well aware of the marketplace’s current lack of “mainstream” appeal. Most of the features, functions, and general user experience that would actually be expected from your typical marketplace user (think your parents, significant other, or friends that aren’t as “crypto crazy” as we all are) are still being built, and they’ve been nicely incorporated into the new Particl 2020 development roadmap.</p><p>Some of the additions required to make the marketplace more “mainstream-appealing” have already been deployed since first releasing the marketplace on mainnet and can be used by anyone at this very moment. They are either features, improvements, or important functions that help make a buyer or seller’s life easier. Let’s review what these improvements and additions are and see how has Particl’s marketplace evolved over the last few months.</p><hr><h2 id=\"how-has-the-marketplace-evolved-since-launch\">How Has the Marketplace Evolved Since Launch?</h2><p>Not only has the marketplace <a href=\"https://www.demarkets.io/stats\">consistently been pushing its <strong>all-time high number of listings</strong> higher and higher</a>, but <a href=\"https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/#!overview\">the <strong>number of mainnet transactions on the Particl network has also seen a dramatic rise</strong></a>, now averaging more than 200 transactions per day. These transactions include listed items, escrow transactions, the flagging of items, created and votes on community proposals, balance transfers, and regular currency transactions.</p><p>Additionally, and perhaps even more importantly, <strong>the Particl network has been getting much more private</strong>! Indeed, the network’s “<strong>anon set</strong>”, the number of RingCT outputs available to anonymize transactions, has been growing exponentially since the launch of the Open Marketplace, averaging a <strong>steady 30% or more increase per month</strong>. The anon set currently stands at 5232, a whopping 149% increase since August 2019. To observe that value goes up and down by yourself, just open up your Particl Desktop wallet and type anonoutput in the console window. As the Open Marketplace and the Particl network gets more adoption, you can expect that number to keep rising, meaning RingCT transactions will keep on getting more private.</p><h2 id=\"more-tools-and-features-made-available\">More Tools and Features Made Available</h2><p>Particl’s Open Marketplace is still Beta software, meaning it is still very much a work-in-progress and under heavy development. As such, it is normal that some of the intended features for its first “final” version are still missing to this day. The good thing, though, is that these features and improvements are coming up quite quickly!</p><p>Ever since the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace on the 12th of August, 2019, we’ve seen these improvements go live…</p><ul><li><strong>Import products (bulk listing)</strong></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-Progress-So-Far/1-6OzrmrlZyD70STSd3qalJQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>This feature allows sellers to <strong>import products from outside sources</strong> such as .csv files and WooCommerce stores. It is particularly useful to <strong>manage large inventories</strong> and <strong>list items in bulk</strong>. This feature is ultimately designed to reach its full potential when used in combination with the upcoming <a href=\"https://particl.news/market-management-is-next-3e35356d5de0\"><strong>Market Management</strong></a> and <strong>Inventory Management</strong> tools.</p><ul><li><strong>Public comments (Q&#x26;A)</strong></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-Progress-So-Far/1-B_MoI8All6pasNe7Bht7CA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>This feature allows anyone to <strong>leave a comment, review, feedback, or question on any listing</strong> posted on the Open Marketplace. Leaving a post notifies the seller of the item which can then respond. Posts made by the seller of an item are clearly identified as such. This feature is intended to better help you make better shopping decisions and know more about the items you’re looking to buy. <strong>Public comments will tie in nicely with future reputation models</strong> intended to be implemented at a later stage during the Beta stage of development.</p><ul><li><strong>Cancel bids</strong></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-Progress-So-Far/1-PPj8p8kjjfVsguxanMHIJA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>It used to be impossible to cancel an order before the seller accepted it, meaning funds could get stuck in limbo when sellers were inactive and not processing orders. While it was possible to manually unlock these coins, it did require a fair bit of technical knowledge about the Particl platform itself. Far from ideal! This is why an update was made to the marketplace to add this important functionality.</p><ul><li><strong>Settings page</strong></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-Progress-So-Far/1-V2s_ynpbpUpMDqb5VTfYkw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>The first iteration of the Settings page has been added a few weeks after the launch of the Open Marketplace Beta. While it currently only contains basic settings such as notification management and wallet backup options, the Settings page will play a bigger role once Market Management and other future major features are integrated.</p><ul><li><strong>In-wallet Bitcoin exchange</strong></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-Progress-So-Far/1-DUg2gAjvJRbh6T2T0c7n9Q.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>This major and exciting update to Particl Desktop added the ability to <strong>swap Bitcoin for Particl</strong> right inside the wallet. This means anyone can now “top up” their Open Marketplace account using Bitcoin. <strong>No need to register on an exchange or give away your personal information</strong> (i.e. KYC, IP address, etc), and it works everywhere, even in the US!</p><p>This exchange module is currently powered by the SMSG network and connects directly to the <a href=\"http://simpleswap.io\"><strong>SimpleSwap</strong></a> exchange, but is built in such a way that it can integrate almost any exchange or service provider as long as the required APIs are provided by the third-party. This update was very important as it opens the door for Particl to be adopted outside of its own community by accepting a varied list of currencies.</p><ul><li><strong>Bot Management</strong></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-Progress-So-Far/1-jw4vyiR1I99aRdq_J6zaiQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>The Bot Management feature was introduced at the same time as the Bitcoin Exchange module was. It is, in fact, what powers it. The Bot Management feature allows you to<strong> use and list SMSG bots that provide added third-party services</strong> to Particl Desktop. These added services can be <strong>bridges to crypto exchanges</strong> or <strong>fiat payment gateways</strong>, as well as many other sorts of services.</p><p>However, because this is the first iteration of the feature, it is currently not possible to manually add your bot to the list of available bots. That’s because security measures still need to be put in place to make sure people do not push malicious bots on the network. The Bot Management tool is planned to be an integral part of the upcoming developer SDK.</p><ul><li><strong>SMSG improvements</strong></li></ul><p>SMSG is the P2P network that powers the Open Marketplace. It securely and privately hosts data (i.e. listing images and descriptions) and makes several processes possible such as displaying listings, flagging items, exchanging Bitcoin for Particl, and etc. It is the backbone of the entire Particl ecosystem.</p><p>Since the marketplace’s mainnet launch, the SMSG network has seen its performance vastly improved, notably with how effectively it displays listings and communicates between peers. Improving SMSG will be an ongoing process as we move forward through the Beta phase of development.</p><ul><li><strong>Significantly reduced listing fees</strong></li></ul><p>One of the big updates that were made to the SMSG network is the ability for stakers to signal lower listing fees to the network. What that means is that anyone staking on the Particl network can have a say on how much the network charges users for publishing listings on the Open Marketplace.</p><p>As a result, ever since the launch of the Beta, <strong>listing fees have been reduced by a big fat 53%</strong>! This is already great, making it much cheaper for sellers to list items, but fees are also expected to<strong> go down even more, by at least 80%</strong>, in the next SMSG update. That’s what <strong>near-zero cost eCommerce</strong> means!</p><ul><li><strong>Various improvements, tweaks, and fixes based on user suggestions</strong></li></ul><p>On top of everything mentioned above, a LOT of tweaks, fixes, and improvements have been made to both the code and the user experience of Particl Desktop and the Open Marketplace. A lot of these changes have been made based on user feedback, and it is the one reason why the “Report bug” button has been added at the bottom left of the Particl Desktop client. All user feedback is very important and really makes it easier for Particl developers to see what areas need to be improved or tweaked. The more feedback is received, the faster issues can be addressed. For this reason, it is highly recommended to be pro-active in reporting issues and making suggestions on Github.</p><hr><p>With all of the above in mind, it is clear that Particl’s marketplace is getting better and easier to use by the day. Of course, there is still some stuff missing or that could be improved, but that’s more than normal given the Beta nature of the product.</p><p>So what’s left to do? What is the marketplace missing?

There are many challenging yet\nachievable goals proposed by this company that validate the contributions\neveryone has made to Particl so far. They also give positive reinforcement to\nour short and long-term direction of building better tech and attracting more\ndaily users; aka adoption.\n\nThe “who” isn’t as important as is the fact that this is more an intriguing\nsampling of many peer reviews our products are receiving from potential\npartners, investors, services looking to join us on this ride. However — of\ncourse — it does matter “who” is really, truly looking at what is going on in\nthe De-Commerce (has a nice ring to it ?) space so I can divulge that it’s a\nlarge crypto company that touches nearly all the top projects and products in\nour space. This is a group we first reached out to about integrations for\nbroader adoption and the relationship has been nurtured for over a\nyear-and-a-half.\n\nSo what do they have to say? My first thought when I read their feedback and\nrecommendations was, “We need to share this with the community!” I’ve said it\nmany times, in the early stages our voice needs to get louder and louder for\nreal adoption to happen. That means all of us.\n\nIt got me excited about 2020 and beyond — I hope it does you as well.\n> “We can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we\ncreated them.” – Albert Einstein, Thinker\nI’ll start at the bottom and work up. First, we have things they identified as\nunsatisfactory or in need of improvements.\n\nAs a trained architect, critique like this is like gold. It’s enlightening to\nread through honest observations, and when we’re enlightened we change.\n\nReducing barriers for adoption\nPrivacy-focused products are niche, underground and nerdy. That’s cool, but\ncan’t be “good enough” and can’t be a crutch to expanding outside of the crypto\necosystem. To this end, Particl is falling into the same trap as Tor, Tails and\neven DuckDuckGo — building better alternatives that add more steps to ensure\nprivacy.\n\n * What are ways we are reducing barriers to see significant marketplace\n   adoption of the Particl Open Marketplace?\n * Is our product available where the target users will find it?\n * Mobile app vs downloadable client\n\nLow transactions using privacy features\nParticl base transactions are private by user choice. Open Marketplace\ntransactions are private by default. Privacy for senders and receivers only\nimproves as the anonymity set increases on chain. Marketplace transactions\nutilize the full suite of privacy features on Particl.\n\n * What are measurable methods to increasing the amount of transactions using\n   privacy features?\n * Are there incentives that can be built in to increase transactions using\n   privacy features?\n * Can services and exchanges be receptive to enabling private transactions with\n   PART?\n\nQuality and depth of product inventory\nCurrently we have around 500 items listed daily on the Open Marketplace. There\nis a lot of variety from games to electronics to health products. However, I\nthink this is one of the most insightful points within the review. Quantity vs\nquality can be the difference between 1,000 daily users and 10,000 daily users.\n\n * What tools to vendors need to move their inventories onto Particl Open\n   Marketplace?\n * Customers use their phone to shop while Particl only offers a downloadable\n   client, when and how does a mobile version of Open Marketplace improve the\n   quality of products available?\n * Who is the target audience?\n\nNext are three areas we actually are focused on at the moment and internally see\nas crucial to improve on. There is no question the Open Marketplace is an\nattractive product — especially compared to traditionally clunky privacy-focused\napplications and cryptocurrency clients. What can we improve upon to\nmetaphorically put some meat on the strong bones in place to take things to the\nnext level?\n\nMore awareness of the growth on the marketplace\nOur Open Marketplace has been live on the main chain for close to 6 months and\nthe small amount of measurable metrics track-able show that it has been\nrelatively successful and is growing. Being private-by-default doesn’t give\ncompanies reviewing our products much to work with to show either profitability\nor growth. It is really just 2 things, volume and transactions. A third metric\nwe can track is MAD contracts. Not the content but just the amount of them that\nget completed. Keeping things private, but finding better ways to bring\nawareness to the popularity of the Open Marketplace will take an army —who’s in?\n\n * Will private markets and private sales featured in the upcoming Market\n   Management module improve secondary/private marketplace awareness?\n * Does pegging prices to a volatile coin like PART hurt growth possibilities\n   versus introducing a stable coin/fiat pairing?\n * How do vendors promote their products?\n\nAdditional dapps featuring PART\nI think growing our development community outside the primary team is a big\nhurdle we haven’t figured out yet. All our repos are open source and there for\nimprovements by anyone at anytime.\n\n * What type of incentive structure can be established to spur on new developers\n   joining the mission of Particl?\n * Can community funding (kickstarter-like) campaigns usher in more ideas,\n   initiatives, opportunities that the team frankly hasn’t even considered or\n   thought of yet?\n * What is the timeline on a simple SDK toolset with documentation so\n   development teams looking for a solution like Particl has already built can\n   jump-start their big business idea?\n\nIncreasing the anonymity set\nPrivacy projects are always fighting among themselves as to who is the best (of\ncourse except us — of course ?). There’s pros and cons on each out there. The\nreal winners are projects that actually code, the real losers are projects that\njust copy other work and turn around an claim to be somehow better. That said,\nprivacy gets better on chain on every solution with a larger anonymity set.\nThat’s the coins in the most private state — Anon for PART. Monero potentially\nwins this battle and can lay claim to the most private coin. They can thank\nbeing private-by-default for that. It forces users to always be in the most\nprivate state of coin, thus increasing the anonymity set.\n\nThis is why, ultimately, the Open Marketplace is private-by-default. The whole\nnetwork of users, even if you never #sellstuff4crypto\n[https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23sellstuff4crypto] on the marketplace, benefits\nfrom everyone else’s private PARTs.\n\n<!-- That came out weird, but I like it, I’ll keep it in here. -->\n\n * Can staking be advanced to include fully anon PART by default?\n * Would 3rd party services be open to accepting transfers with stealth\n   addresses and private addresses?\n * Is there a future where everything on PART chain is private-by-default?\n * Is it even desirable?\n\nFinally the private review identified 3 milestones Particl should emphatically\nconsider to drive more interest from services, partners and exchanges.\n\nAgain, I think these are great goals and 1,000% achievable with an army of\npassionate users. The louder and louder we become, the simpler the path to\nadoption becomes.\n\nReach 2,500 average daily product listings for one month\n * Currently, we are around 500+ listings and growing.\n\nReach 25,000 total Particl Desktop & Desktop core downloads\n * Currently, we are around 17,000 downloads combined.\n\nPublic reviews for the Marketplace\n * These reviews can be on YouTube, Twitter, Medium, etc\n\nIf you haven’t taken the time to read the latest updates from the team, please\nadd the most recent posts from Crypto Guard [https://medium.com/u/2be55e0c3a02] \nto your reading list. There’s a lot to get excited about this year. Come along\nfor the ride! #DeCommerce\n\nThank you\nParticl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/03/1-59_jcUVvZIjWyhXxpBX0bg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/1-59_jcUVvZIjWyhXxpBX0bg.jpeg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/1-59_jcUVvZIjWyhXxpBX0bg.jpeg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2021/03/1-59_jcUVvZIjWyhXxpBX0bg.jpeg 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/03/1-59_jcUVvZIjWyhXxpBX0bg.jpeg 1920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"></figure><p>I’d like to share with you some feedback our team received back recently from a private peer review of the Open Marketplace.

As they say, the cat is out of the bag\nand there ain’t no stopping it!\n\nShortly before that moment, world-renowned security firm Quarkslab\n[https://www.quarkslab.com/en/] released the results of their audit of Particl’s\ncustom-built RingCT (MLSAG, more specifically) and Bulletproofs protocols.

Because of that, Particl was able to\ndeliver on its two biggest promised deliverables for mainnet —the Open\nMarketplace and RingCT (untraceable transactions).\n\nParticl’s Open Marketplace live on mainnet!Yes, 2019 was a development heavy\nyear. That is thanks to a passionate team of developers and contributors who\nsimply won’t give up on the idea of private, free, and borderless eCommerce.\nThey breathe and bleed Particl, and each day they help make that vision a\nreality and make it more and more accessible to everybody.\n\nTogether, let’s go through the 2019 development timeline.

Keep in mind it doesn’t even include Particl\nCore releases! ?\n\nIndeed, one particularly impressive aspect of Particl’s development is how it\nalways keeps its codebase up-to-date with the latest Bitcoin codebase version.\nThat’s to ensure Particl’s base layer benefits from all the latest Bitcoin\nimprovements so that it can remain secure and can easily integrate any\ninnovation happening in Bitcoin’s world. Put simply, an up-to-date codebase\nmeans security, reliability, performance, and compatibility.\n\nAnd while “keeping the codebase up-to-date” may initially sound like a simple\nand almost robotic task, there’s definitely a reason barely any Bitcoin-based\n“altcoin”, if any, properly keeps its codebase up-to-date — it’s a tedious and\nquite complicated task. That’s because the upstream Bitcoin code needs to be\nmade to fit and be compatible with any added component to Particl’s codebase. It\ncouldn’t further from a simple “copy-paste process”…\n\nThis year, this translated into 19 individual core releases, a true testament to\nthe constant hard work put in by Particl’s Core Developer & Cryptographic\nResearcher Tecnovert [https://github.com/tecnovert].\n\nParticl Core Releases (19 total)\n * Jan. 1, 2019 —Particl Core 0.17.1.0\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.0]\n * Feb. 6, 2019 —Particl Core 0.17.1.2\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.2]\n * Feb. 14, 2019 —Particl Core 0.17.1.3\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.3]\n * Mar. 7, 2019 —Particl Core 0.17.1.4\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.4]\n * May 9, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.0.7\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.7]\n * Jun. 4, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.0.8\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.8]\n * Jun. 24, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.0.10\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.10]\n * Jul. 2, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.0.11\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.11]\n * Jul. 18, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.0.12\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.12]\n * Aug. 4, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.0\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.0]\n * Aug. 8, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.1\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.1]\n * Aug. 12, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.2\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.2]\n * Aug. 22, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.3\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.3]\n * Sep. 3, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.4\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.4]\n * Sep. 26, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.5\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.5]\n * Oct. 29, 2019 —Particl Core 0.19.0.1 RC2 (Pre-Release)\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1rc2]\n * Oct. 31, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.6\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.6]\n * Dec. 4, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.7 (Pre-Release)\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.7]\n * Dec. 3, 2019 —Particl Core 0.19.0.1 (Pre-Release)\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Around the World\nAnother great move by Particl in 2019 was to increase its boots-on-the-ground\npresence by attending, sponsoring, and presenting at several blockchain\nconferences, events, and meetups all around the world.\n\nSome of Particl’s team after SFBW’s Epicenter conferenceBlockchain events are\nideal networking opportunities for teams to find each other, build\nrelationships, and start collaborating on multiple fronts. In that sense, they\nare the perfect “matchmakers”.\n\nAs such, the Particl team has made a lot of key connections with individuals and\nteams that will help the project make the jump from an almost exclusively\ndevelopment focused project to one putting much more focus into the user\nadoption of its platform.\n\nIt’s very important to understand one thing, though, is that these relationships\nbuilt at blockchain events can take some time until they start yielding visible\nresults. Most of the time, it takes many dozens of work hours and conference\ncalls before things fall into place and start moving ahead.

The team is currently in active talks with\nmany people and projects met at conferences and it should yield more visible\nresults later on in 2020.\n\nPut simply, some of the best decisions taken by the Particl team in 2019 was to\nattend Consensus and the San Francisco Blockchain Week (SFBW).\n\n2019 Conferences and Events\n * Feb. 4, 2019 —Particl in Paris — CoinHouse\n   [https://particl.news/particl-in-paris-presentations-at-coinhouse-a38106cdd36a] \n    ??\n * Mar. 13–14, 2019 —Particl in Hong Kong — Token2049\n   [https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b] \n    ??\n * May 11–12, 2019 —Particl in NYC — Magical Crypto Conference\n   [https://particl.news/particl-in-nyc-magical-crypto-conference-2019-459c1f868522] \n    ??\n * May 13–15, 2019 —Particl in NYC — Consensus\n   [https://particl.news/particl-in-nyc-consensus-2019-3f6671bd2aa6] ??\n * June 25–26, 2019 —Particl in San Francisco — Bitcoin2019\n   [https://particl.news/particl-in-san-francisco-bitcoin2019-571fe31fe396] ??\n * Oct. 28–29, 2019 —Particl in Vegas — Money2020\n   [https://particl.news/particl-world-tour-2019-f6e3d3c7e09c] ??\n * Oct. 30, 2019 —Particl in Vegas — World Crypto Conference\n   [https://particl.news/particl-world-tour-2019-f6e3d3c7e09c] ??\n * Oct. 28-Nov. 3, 2019 —Particl in San Francisco — SFBW\n   [https://particl.news/particl-in-san-francisco-sfbw-2019-bdaf0426349a] ??\n * Nov. 14, 2019 —Particl in Singapore — Blockshow\n   [https://particl.news/particl-world-tour-2019-f6e3d3c7e09c] ??\n * Nov. 21–22, 2019 —Particl in Finland — Slush Helsinki\n   [https://particl.news/particl-in-finland-slush-helsinki-1383c1d083c3] ??\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat Can We Take Back From 2019?\nLast year was a year of straight-up delivery with both Particl’s long-awaited\nOpen Marketplace and RingCT (with Bulletproofs) going live on mainnet. More\nimportantly, 2019 will forever be the year where private, free, and borderless\neCommerce became a reality for everyone. A very important milestone in human\ncommerce’s history when you think of it…\n\nIt’s also a year where it became obvious that simply pushing innovative and\nunique blockchain code just doesn’t cut it alone for a project to see great\nsuccess and get decent exposure. And that’s okay, even great, because it signals\nthat the industry is becoming more mature and wants to see blockchain products\nfinally get some “real-world adoption”. That’s the metaphorical “blockchain\nkiller product”, and that’s precisely why Particl is bound to shine moving\nforward!\n\nIn fact, the Open Marketplace is a unique offering — it offers unmatched privacy\nin eCommerce and allows sellers and buyers to connect directly and safely\ntransact by paying almost no fee at all. It takes third-parties (marketplace\noperator, payment processor, web host, etc) totally out of the eCommerce process\nand secures the user’s data and personal information at every step of the way, a\nperk that’s definitely becoming more and more valuable in an era of\never-increasing data mining, breaches, and identity thefts\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/08/20/data-breaches-expose-41-billion-records-in-first-six-months-of-2019/#59551d93bd54]\n.\n\nParticl’s Adoption\nYet, the level of adoption of the marketplace is still relatively low at this\nmoment, a surprising fact for some. That’s due to a few reasons both internal\nand external to Particl, and luckily none of these reasons should really sound\nthe alarm bell.\n\nSome of these reasons are directly due to Particl itself. In fact, the Open\nMarketplace is still very much an early Beta software and is simply not ready\nfor mass adoption just yet. After all, it more than clearly says so in the\nmarketplace’s header banner on Particl Desktop.\n\nAs a matter of fact, some of the processes as well as the user interface of the\nmarketplace are still relatively complicated for most people to use. The\nmarketplace also lacks a few important features usually expected by either\nbuyers or sellers on traditional online marketplaces. In reality, any\nsignificant amount of money invested towards aggressive user adoption campaigns\nwould more than likely result in a poor user adoption rates simply due to the\nearliness of Particl’s product. Getting people to peek around is one thing,\ngetting them to become Particl marketplace users is another thing entirely.\n\nSome of the reasons are also external to Particl. For example, the more than\ntwo-year-long cryptocurrency “bear market” surely hasn’t really encouraged\nlong-term cryptocurrency holders to spend their coins the same way a “bull\nmarket” would…\n\nA New Roadmap is on the Way\nThe very good news is that the Particl team is very aware of its marketplace’s\nbottlenecks! With Market Management, a very major marketplace update, coming out\nin a few weeks, it will mark the completion of a very high-level overview of\nwhat the marketplace was initially imagined to be — an open eCommerce network\npopulated by an infinite amount of markets. In other words, the release of\nMarket Management marks the end of a very particular development phase for the\nproject.\n\nThat being said, that also means that it marks the very beginning of a new\ndevelopment phase, one that will be all about building the right features and\ntools for its targeted users. This new phase will also be all about increasing\nthe marketplace’s accessibility, ease of use, and user interface as much as\npossible. In simple terms, this new phase is all about eliminating any reason\nwhy most people would not buy and/or sell on Particl.\n\nBuckle Up!\nIn the next few days, multiple blog posts will be published on Particl.news\n[http://Particl.news]. They will be a deep dive into the marketplace’s current\nstatus, its level of adoption, and current bottlenecks. They will also explain,\nin detail, the reasoning behind the Particl team’s strategy moving forward as it\njumps in this new decade with both feet. This mini blog post series will\nultimately culminate with the exciting reveal of the new Particl roadmap! Get\nready, as the new roadmap is more than likely to blow a few people’s minds! ?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Particl team would love to thank you all for being part of this very special\nproject and wishes you a very fruitful new decade.

Keep in mind it doesn’t even include Particl Core releases! ?</p><p>Indeed, one particularly impressive aspect of Particl’s development is how <strong>it always keeps its codebase up-to-date with the latest Bitcoin codebase version</strong>. That’s to ensure Particl’s base layer benefits from all the latest Bitcoin improvements so that it can remain secure and can easily integrate any innovation happening in Bitcoin’s world. Put simply, an up-to-date codebase means <strong>security</strong>, <strong>reliability</strong>, <strong>performance</strong>, and <strong>compatibility</strong>.</p><p>And while “keeping the codebase up-to-date” may initially sound like a simple and almost robotic task, there’s definitely a reason barely any Bitcoin-based “altcoin”, if any, properly keeps its codebase up-to-date — it’s a tedious and quite complicated task. That’s because the upstream Bitcoin code needs to be made to fit and be compatible with any added component to Particl’s codebase. It couldn’t further from a simple “copy-paste process”…</p><p>This year, this translated into <strong>19 individual core releases</strong>, a true testament to the constant hard work put in by Particl’s Core Developer &amp; Cryptographic Researcher <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert\"><strong>Tecnovert</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"particl-core-releases-19-total-\">Particl Core Releases (19 total)</h3><ul><li>Jan. 1, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.0\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.0</strong></a></li><li>Feb. 6, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.2\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.2</strong></a></li><li>Feb. 14, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.3\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.3</strong></a></li><li>Mar. 7, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.4\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.4</strong></a></li><li>May 9, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.7\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.7</strong></a></li><li>Jun. 4, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.8\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.8</strong></a></li><li>Jun. 24, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.10\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.10</strong></a></li><li>Jul. 2, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.11\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.11</strong></a></li><li>Jul. 18, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.12\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.12</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 4, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.0\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.0</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 8, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.1\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.1</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 12, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.2\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.2</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 22, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.3\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.3</strong></a></li><li>Sep. 3, 2019 —<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.4\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.4</strong></a></li><li>Sep. 26, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.5\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.5</strong></a></li><li>Oct. 29, 2019 —<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1rc2\"> <strong>Particl Core 0.19.0.1 RC2 (Pre-Release)</strong></a></li><li>Oct. 31, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.6\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.6</strong></a></li><li>Dec. 4, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.7\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.7 (Pre-Release)</strong></a></li><li>Dec. 3, 2019 —<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1\"><strong>Particl Core 0.19.0.1 (Pre-Release)</strong></a></li></ul><hr><h2 id=\"particl-around-the-world\">Particl Around the World</h2><p>Another great move by Particl in 2019 was to increase its boots-on-the-ground presence by attending, sponsoring, and presenting at several blockchain conferences, events, and meetups all around the world.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-s-2019-Year-in-Review/1-Gbg9aHfYJ9bhiThjAvvKwQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Some of Particl’s team after SFBW’s Epicenter conference</figcaption></figure><p>Blockchain events are ideal networking opportunities for teams to find each other, build relationships, and start collaborating on multiple fronts.

More importantly, 2019 will forever be the year where private, free, and borderless eCommerce became a reality for everyone. A very important milestone in human commerce’s history when you think of it…</p><p>It’s also a year where it became obvious that simply pushing innovative and unique blockchain code just doesn’t cut it alone for a project to see great success and get decent exposure. And that’s okay, even great, because it signals that the industry is becoming more mature and wants to see blockchain products finally get some “real-world adoption”. That’s the metaphorical “blockchain killer product”, and <strong>that’s precisely why Particl is bound to shine moving forward!</strong></p><p>In fact, the Open Marketplace is a unique offering — it offers <strong>unmatched privacy in eCommerce</strong> and <strong>allows sellers and buyers to connect directly and safely transact by paying almost no fee at all</strong>. It takes third-parties (marketplace operator, payment processor, web host, etc) totally out of the eCommerce process and secures the user’s data and personal information at every step of the way, a perk that’s definitely becoming more and more valuable in <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/08/20/data-breaches-expose-41-billion-records-in-first-six-months-of-2019/#59551d93bd54\"><strong>an era of ever-increasing data mining, breaches, and identity thefts</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"particl-s-adoption\">Particl’s Adoption</h3><p>Yet, the level of adoption of the marketplace is still relatively low at this moment, a surprising fact for some. That’s due to a few reasons both internal and external to Particl, and luckily none of these reasons should really sound the alarm bell.</p><p><strong>Some of these reasons are directly due to Particl itself</strong>. In fact, the Open Marketplace is still very much an <strong>early Beta software</strong> and is simply not ready for mass adoption just yet. After all, it more than clearly says so in the marketplace’s header banner on Particl Desktop.</p><p>As a matter of fact, some of the processes as well as the user interface of the marketplace are still relatively complicated for most people to use. The marketplace also lacks a few important features usually expected by either buyers or sellers on traditional online marketplaces. In reality, any significant amount of money invested towards aggressive user adoption campaigns would more than likely result in a poor user adoption rates simply due to the earliness of Particl’s product. Getting people to peek around is one thing, getting them to become Particl marketplace users is another thing entirely.</p><p><strong>Some of the reasons are also external to Particl</strong>. For example, the more than two-year-long cryptocurrency “bear market” surely hasn’t really encouraged long-term cryptocurrency holders to spend their coins the same way a “bull market” would…</p><h2 id=\"a-new-roadmap-is-on-the-way\">A New Roadmap is on the Way</h2><p>The very good news is that the Particl team is very aware of its marketplace’s bottlenecks! With Market Management, a very major marketplace update, coming out in a few weeks, it will mark the completion of a very high-level overview of what the marketplace was initially imagined to be — an open eCommerce network populated by an infinite amount of markets. In other words, the release of Market Management marks the end of a very particular development phase for the project.</p><p>That being said, that also means that it marks the very beginning of a new development phase, one that will be all about building the right features and tools for its targeted users. This new phase will also be all about increasing the marketplace’s accessibility, ease of use, and user interface as much as possible. <strong>In simple terms, this new phase is all about eliminating any reason why most people would not buy and/or sell on Particl.</strong></p><h3 id=\"buckle-up-\">Buckle Up!</h3><p>In the next few days, multiple blog posts will be published on <a href=\"http://Particl.news\"><strong>Particl.news</strong></a>. They will be a deep dive into the marketplace’s current status, its level of adoption, and current bottlenecks. They will also explain, in detail, the reasoning behind the Particl team’s strategy moving forward as it jumps in this new decade with both feet. <strong>This mini blog post series will ultimately culminate with the exciting reveal of the new Particl roadmap! </strong>Get ready, as the new roadmap is more than likely to blow a few people’s minds! ?</p><hr><p>The Particl team would love to thank you all for being part of this very special project and wishes you a very fruitful new decade.

Keep in mind it doesn’t even include Particl Core releases! ?</p><p>Indeed, one particularly impressive aspect of Particl’s development is how <strong>it always keeps its codebase up-to-date with the latest Bitcoin codebase version</strong>. That’s to ensure Particl’s base layer benefits from all the latest Bitcoin improvements so that it can remain secure and can easily integrate any innovation happening in Bitcoin’s world. Put simply, an up-to-date codebase means <strong>security</strong>, <strong>reliability</strong>, <strong>performance</strong>, and <strong>compatibility</strong>.</p><p>And while “keeping the codebase up-to-date” may initially sound like a simple and almost robotic task, there’s definitely a reason barely any Bitcoin-based “altcoin”, if any, properly keeps its codebase up-to-date — it’s a tedious and quite complicated task. That’s because the upstream Bitcoin code needs to be made to fit and be compatible with any added component to Particl’s codebase. It couldn’t further from a simple “copy-paste process”…</p><p>This year, this translated into <strong>19 individual core releases</strong>, a true testament to the constant hard work put in by Particl’s Core Developer &#x26; Cryptographic Researcher <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert\"><strong>Tecnovert</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"particl-core-releases-19-total-\">Particl Core Releases (19 total)</h3><ul><li>Jan. 1, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.0\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.0</strong></a></li><li>Feb. 6, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.2\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.2</strong></a></li><li>Feb. 14, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.3\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.3</strong></a></li><li>Mar. 7, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.4\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.4</strong></a></li><li>May 9, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.7\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.7</strong></a></li><li>Jun. 4, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.8\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.8</strong></a></li><li>Jun. 24, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.10\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.10</strong></a></li><li>Jul. 2, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.11\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.11</strong></a></li><li>Jul. 18, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.12\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.12</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 4, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.0\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.0</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 8, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.1\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.1</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 12, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.2\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.2</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 22, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.3\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.3</strong></a></li><li>Sep. 3, 2019 —<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.4\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.4</strong></a></li><li>Sep. 26, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.5\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.5</strong></a></li><li>Oct. 29, 2019 —<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1rc2\"> <strong>Particl Core 0.19.0.1 RC2 (Pre-Release)</strong></a></li><li>Oct. 31, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.6\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.6</strong></a></li><li>Dec. 4, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.7\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.7 (Pre-Release)</strong></a></li><li>Dec. 3, 2019 —<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1\"><strong>Particl Core 0.19.0.1 (Pre-Release)</strong></a></li></ul><hr><h2 id=\"particl-around-the-world\">Particl Around the World</h2><p>Another great move by Particl in 2019 was to increase its boots-on-the-ground presence by attending, sponsoring, and presenting at several blockchain conferences, events, and meetups all around the world.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-2019-Year-in-Review/1-Gbg9aHfYJ9bhiThjAvvKwQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Some of Particl’s team after SFBW’s Epicenter conference</figcaption></figure><p>Blockchain events are ideal networking opportunities for teams to find each other, build relationships, and start collaborating on multiple fronts.

More importantly, 2019 will forever be the year where private, free, and borderless eCommerce became a reality for everyone. A very important milestone in human commerce’s history when you think of it…</p><p>It’s also a year where it became obvious that simply pushing innovative and unique blockchain code just doesn’t cut it alone for a project to see great success and get decent exposure. And that’s okay, even great, because it signals that the industry is becoming more mature and wants to see blockchain products finally get some “real-world adoption”. That’s the metaphorical “blockchain killer product”, and <strong>that’s precisely why Particl is bound to shine moving forward!</strong></p><p>In fact, the Open Marketplace is a unique offering — it offers <strong>unmatched privacy in eCommerce</strong> and <strong>allows sellers and buyers to connect directly and safely transact by paying almost no fee at all</strong>. It takes third-parties (marketplace operator, payment processor, web host, etc) totally out of the eCommerce process and secures the user’s data and personal information at every step of the way, a perk that’s definitely becoming more and more valuable in <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/08/20/data-breaches-expose-41-billion-records-in-first-six-months-of-2019/#59551d93bd54\"><strong>an era of ever-increasing data mining, breaches, and identity thefts</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"particl-s-adoption\">Particl’s Adoption</h3><p>Yet, the level of adoption of the marketplace is still relatively low at this moment, a surprising fact for some. That’s due to a few reasons both internal and external to Particl, and luckily none of these reasons should really sound the alarm bell.</p><p><strong>Some of these reasons are directly due to Particl itself</strong>. In fact, the Open Marketplace is still very much an <strong>early Beta software</strong> and is simply not ready for mass adoption just yet. After all, it more than clearly says so in the marketplace’s header banner on Particl Desktop.</p><p>As a matter of fact, some of the processes as well as the user interface of the marketplace are still relatively complicated for most people to use. The marketplace also lacks a few important features usually expected by either buyers or sellers on traditional online marketplaces. In reality, any significant amount of money invested towards aggressive user adoption campaigns would more than likely result in a poor user adoption rates simply due to the earliness of Particl’s product. Getting people to peek around is one thing, getting them to become Particl marketplace users is another thing entirely.</p><p><strong>Some of the reasons are also external to Particl</strong>. For example, the more than two-year-long cryptocurrency “bear market” surely hasn’t really encouraged long-term cryptocurrency holders to spend their coins the same way a “bull market” would…</p><h2 id=\"a-new-roadmap-is-on-the-way\">A New Roadmap is on the Way</h2><p>The very good news is that the Particl team is very aware of its marketplace’s bottlenecks! With Market Management, a very major marketplace update, coming out in a few weeks, it will mark the completion of a very high-level overview of what the marketplace was initially imagined to be — an open eCommerce network populated by an infinite amount of markets. In other words, the release of Market Management marks the end of a very particular development phase for the project.</p><p>That being said, that also means that it marks the very beginning of a new development phase, one that will be all about building the right features and tools for its targeted users. This new phase will also be all about increasing the marketplace’s accessibility, ease of use, and user interface as much as possible. <strong>In simple terms, this new phase is all about eliminating any reason why most people would not buy and/or sell on Particl.</strong></p><h3 id=\"buckle-up-\">Buckle Up!</h3><p>In the next few days, multiple blog posts will be published on <a href=\"http://Particl.news\"><strong>Particl.news</strong></a>. They will be a deep dive into the marketplace’s current status, its level of adoption, and current bottlenecks. They will also explain, in detail, the reasoning behind the Particl team’s strategy moving forward as it jumps in this new decade with both feet. <strong>This mini blog post series will ultimately culminate with the exciting reveal of the new Particl roadmap! </strong>Get ready, as the new roadmap is more than likely to blow a few people’s minds! ?</p><hr><p>The Particl team would love to thank you all for being part of this very special project and wishes you a very fruitful new decade.

In\nfact, they often fare worse than traditional fiat currencies in preserving\nfinancial confidentiality. Indeed, fiat systems typically handle fund transfers\nthrough secured channels designed to safeguard users' financial data from\nunauthorized public exposure.\n\nIn stark contrast, all Bitcoin transactions are permanently recorded on a public\nledger, openly exposing the entirety of one's financial details to any curious\nobserver. While Bitcoin's pseudonymous nature may foster a sense of anonymity in\nlimited contexts, this perception is increasingly recognized as a dangerous\nillusion.\n\nIn fact, transaction tracing capabilities have advanced significantly in the\npast few years, driven in part by regulatory requirements like\nKnow-Your-Customer (KYC) compliance that have necessitated increased transaction\nmonitoring by financial services.\n\nHistorically, only regulatory bodies and financial institutions had access to\ndetailed reports of users' on-chain financial histories through partnerships\nwith blockchain analytics firms however, the ability to effectively deanonymize\ntransactions and map them to real-world identities is rapidly proliferating to\nnew actors — most concerningly, criminals, hackers, and other malicious entities\nintent on exploiting this data for financial gain at the expense of unsuspecting\nvictims — thanks to the rapid evolution of large language models and artificial\nintelligence that have spawned widely accessible tracing protocols.\n\nThese escalating privacy vulnerabilities underscore the paramount importance of\ndeveloping robust privacy-preserving solutions for cryptocurrencies across the\nglobe, such as, among others, ”privacy coins”. Maintaining financial\nconfidentiality is not merely a luxury but an essential capability to safeguard\nusers operating in these systems.\n\nBitcoin and eCommerce\nHowever, when it comes to decentralized commerce – the logical evolution beyond\ndecentralized currencies – merely utilizing privacy coins is not sufficient.\nWhile on-chain transactions may be inherently private, the platforms\nfacilitating purchases and sales represent another significant attack vector\nthat must be addressed.\n\nAs regulatory obligations evolve, businesses operating centralized\ncryptocurrency platforms may be compelled to collect extensive user information,\nincluding transaction histories, associated identities, IP addresses, shipping\ndetails from buyers, sales data from sellers, and more. While one could\nreasonably expect regulatory bodies to handle such information responsibly, the\nsame assurances cannot be extended to the platforms themselves, as highlighted\nin our previous articles on the imperatives of privacy here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/] \nand here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-the-need-to-own-your-data-19bc31b0ec74/]\n.\n\nBut even if all platforms always acted in good faith, this centralized\naggregation of sensitive data becomes an enticing target for hackers and other\nmalicious actors seeking to exploit personal and financial information for\nillicit gains.\n\nThe Inherent Safety Risks of DeCommerce\nThe logical solution, therefore, is to develop an eCommerce platform that is as\ndecentralized as cryptocurrencies themselves. Such a platform would operate in a\npurely peer-to-peer manner, built upon a truly decentralized architecture devoid\nof single points of failure or centralized components. The objective is to offer\nservices akin to centralized eCommerce giants like eBay or Amazon, but without\nany central entity, thus eliminating the associated costs, fees, and frictions\ninherent to intermediaries. A \"decentralized online marketplace\", embodying\nBitcoin's ethos, and providing a clear user experience improvement over\ncentralized counterparts without data collection.\n\nHowever, while recent advancements in blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies\nenable such decentralized eCommerce platforms, they also introduce new\nchallenges in preserving users' financial data privacy and safety.\n\nPicture this scenario: You open a decentralized marketplace, hoping to purchase\na new computer online. You browse available listings from sellers worldwide and\nfind a suitable item. You proceed to add it to your cart and checkout, providing\nthe seller with your shipping address. Herein lies a significant safety concern;\nif you've paid using pseudonymous cryptocurrencies, you've likely revealed your\nphysical location alongside your entire financial history, including balances\nand past transactions.\n\nIn most cases, such disclosures may be innocuous, however, over an extended\nperiod, you or someone else may inadvertently expose critical details to\nmalicious actors, which could be used to identify and target the potential\nvictim. This risk vector is particularly concerning for high net-worth\nindividuals, as every purchase they make could effectively paint a target on\ntheir backs, making this situation simply unsustainable.\n\nCentralized platforms like eBay or Amazon typically circumvent this issue, as\npayments are facilitated through highly regulated centralized providers like\nPayPal, among others. While these entities face valid criticisms, they at least\navoid exposing users' complete financial histories on pseudonymous ledgers.\n\nHowever, a decentralized platform, by its very nature, does not rely on payment\nprocessors. Instead, it enables direct peer-to-peer trade between buyers and\nsellers. Consequently, an alternative solution must be implemented to preserve\nusers' financial privacy and security.\n\nThe Need for Privacy in DeCommerce\nParticl Marketplace addresses these concerns with its decentralized and secure\nonline marketplace, often touted as a privacy-first eCommerce solution. It\nensures user safety by providing robust privacy safeguards in two critical\nareas.\n\nTransactional Privacy\nFirst, it facilitates complete transactional privacy for counterparties through\nthe use of PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, which integrates advanced\non-chain privacy protocols. Two specific protocols are instrumental in\npreserving financial confidentiality: Confidential Transactions (\"CT\") and ring\nsignatures (\"RingCT\").\n\nCT transactions conceal the transfer amounts between parties, while RingCT\nobfuscates both transaction amounts and participant identities. However, RingCT\ntransactions lack programmable outputs, rendering them incompatible with\ndecentralized applications like Particl Marketplace. To address this limitation,\nRingCT inputs can be mapped to CT outputs, which possess programmable\ncapabilities. By chaining these protocols, Particl Marketplace effectively\nharnesses RingCT's enhanced privacy while facilitating seamless integration,\nproviding users with safety — which is otherwise entirely absent without\ntransactional privacy — and the assurance that their financial data remains\nconfidential during transactions.\n\nData-free Marketplace Activity\nSecondly, Particl Marketplace addresses the concerns surrounding excessive data\ncollection practices by centralized eCommerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, and\nEtsy, which have faced criticism for undermining user privacy. Some platforms\nhave even exploited user data to directly compete with their own sellers, as\nexemplified by AmazonBasics products and other Amazon sub-brands – an issue we\nhave previously explored in depth here\n[https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/].\n\nMoreover, while platforms claim to harvest data to enhance user experiences,\ntracking shopping habits can inadvertently expose sensitive information without\nconsent. A notable example is the Target pregnancy prediction case, in which an\nunsuspecting father learned of his daughter's pregnancy due to ad targeting – a\nscenario we’ve also previously discussed here\n[https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/].\n\nTo safeguard against such privacy infringements and data misuse, Particl\nMarketplace is designed to eliminate data generation, collection, storage, or\ndistribution entirely – encompassing both financial and non-financial metadata.\nAll marketplace activity data is stored locally, and all data transmitted (such\nas buyer-seller communications or shipping details) is conveyed through\nend-to-end encrypted messages via SMSG, a peer-to-peer data and messaging\nplatform (\"mixnet\") operating alongside Particl Core nodes\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/].\n\nThis privacy-first architecture ensures user safety and guarantees complete data\nownership and control, while preventing malicious data extraction through hacks,\nexploits, or the simple act of buying or selling online.\n\nConclusion\nWhile various accessibility, usability, and user-experience improvements are\nstill needed, the end result is a decentralized online marketplace that\neliminates fees and associated frictions inherent to third-party intermediaries\nwithin the eCommerce domain.\n\nHowever, beyond these benefits, it primarily serves as a secure platform for\ncryptocurrency users to engage in direct peer-to-peer trade without compromising\ntheir safety by exposing financial information to potentially malicious\nstrangers.\n\nAs we have aimed to clarify with this blog post, privacy in the context of\ncryptocurrency usage transcends a luxury or edge case. In scenarios such as\neCommerce/deCommerce, it is an absolute necessity to ensure the safety and\nwell-being of users transacting with unknown counterparties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

Indeed, fiat systems typically handle fund transfers through secured channels designed to safeguard users' financial data from unauthorized public exposure.</p><p>In stark contrast, all Bitcoin transactions are permanently recorded on a public ledger, openly exposing the entirety of one's financial details to any curious observer.

Maintaining financial confidentiality is not merely a luxury but an essential capability to safeguard users operating in these systems.</p><h1 id=\"bitcoin-and-ecommerce\">Bitcoin and eCommerce</h1><p>However, when it comes to decentralized commerce – the logical evolution beyond decentralized currencies – merely utilizing privacy coins is not sufficient.

Such a platform would operate in a purely peer-to-peer manner, built upon a truly decentralized architecture devoid of single points of failure or centralized components. The objective is to offer services akin to centralized eCommerce giants like eBay or Amazon, but without any central entity, thus eliminating the associated costs, fees, and frictions inherent to intermediaries. A \"decentralized online marketplace\", embodying Bitcoin's ethos, and providing a clear user experience improvement over centralized counterparts without data collection.</p><p>However, while recent advancements in blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies enable such decentralized eCommerce platforms, they also introduce new challenges in preserving users' financial data privacy and safety.</p><p>Picture this scenario: You open a decentralized marketplace, hoping to purchase a new computer online. You browse available listings from sellers worldwide and find a suitable item. You proceed to add it to your cart and checkout, providing the seller with your shipping address. Herein lies a significant safety concern; if you've paid using pseudonymous cryptocurrencies, you've likely revealed your physical location alongside your entire financial history, including balances and past transactions.</p><p>In most cases, such disclosures may be innocuous, however, over an extended period, you or someone else may inadvertently expose critical details to malicious actors, which could be used to identify and target the potential victim. This risk vector is particularly concerning for high net-worth individuals, as every purchase they make could effectively paint a target on their backs, making this situation simply unsustainable.</p><p>Centralized platforms like eBay or Amazon typically circumvent this issue, as payments are facilitated through highly regulated centralized providers like PayPal, among others. While these entities face valid criticisms, they at least avoid exposing users' complete financial histories on pseudonymous ledgers.</p><p>However, a decentralized platform, by its very nature, does not rely on payment processors.

It ensures user safety by providing robust privacy safeguards in two critical areas.</p><h2 id=\"transactional-privacy\">Transactional Privacy</h2><p>First, it facilitates complete transactional privacy for counterparties through the use of PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, which integrates advanced on-chain privacy protocols. Two specific protocols are instrumental in preserving financial confidentiality: Confidential Transactions (\"CT\") and ring signatures (\"RingCT\").</p><p>CT transactions conceal the transfer amounts between parties, while RingCT obfuscates both transaction amounts and participant identities. However, RingCT transactions lack programmable outputs, rendering them incompatible with decentralized applications like Particl Marketplace. To address this limitation, RingCT inputs can be mapped to CT outputs, which possess programmable capabilities. By chaining these protocols, Particl Marketplace effectively harnesses RingCT's enhanced privacy while facilitating seamless integration, providing users with safety — which is otherwise entirely absent without transactional privacy — and the assurance that their financial data remains confidential during transactions.</p><h2 id=\"data-free-marketplace-activity\">Data-free Marketplace Activity</h2><p>Secondly, Particl Marketplace addresses the concerns surrounding excessive data collection practices by centralized eCommerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, and Etsy, which have faced criticism for undermining user privacy.

for seamless and\npractical decentralized commerce solutions remains a driving force. Although\nthis is a self-evident use case for crypto, comprehensive solutions to use\ndecentralized money as money, without relying on heavily centralized\narchitecture, is lacking.\n\nWhile achieving this goal has proven challenging, this article explores how\nintegrating BasicSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) that offers Litecoin\npairs, into Particl Marketplace, a decentralized e-commerce platform, offers a\nsolution to overcome many user experience obstacles that have come to hinder the\nevolution of cryptocurrencies as a medium of payment.\n\nBy providing multi-currency support\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-integration-unlocking-currency-agnostic-commerce-on-particl/] \nto the decentralized e-commerce ecosystem, this upcoming integration offers a\ntangible path forward for many coins, unlocking the potential for widespread\ncryptocurrency usage in everyday retail transactions.\n\nWith this in mind, Litecoin, with its focused push as a payment currency, serves\nas the perfect candidate to illustrate this transformative potential, allowing\nanyone to use Litecoin for shopping.\n\nLitecoin; Faster and Cheaper Transactions\nLitecoin has garnered significant attention for its faster transaction times and\nlower fees compared to Bitcoin – a stark contrast to the latter's reputation for\nsluggish and costly processing. This, from the beginning, has positioned\nLitecoin as an ideal cryptocurrency for payments and commerce. Recognizing its\nstrengths in speed and affordability, the Litecoin community has been actively\npromoting its adoption as a practical and viable payment solution for years now.\n\nLitecoin MWEB and Privacy: Solidifying Litecoin as True Digital Cash\nLitecoin's MWEB (MimbleWimble Extension Blocks) introduces a significant\nimprovement to an already payment-friendly digital currency: transactional\nprivacy. This brings confidential transactions and privacy features to the\nLitecoin network, a pivotal development poised to solidify its positioning as\ntrue digital cash and a viable currency for payments.\n\nPrivacy is, of course, a crucial aspect in the realm of digital payments, as it\nsafeguards users' and businesses' financial information and promotes fungibility\n– a fundamental characteristic of sound money.\n\nParticl Marketplace: Redefining Decentralized E-Commerce\nWhile transactional privacy is paramount, it is also crucial for the platform\nfacilitating such payments to uphold privacy as well.\n\nEnvision this scenario: you send a private payment using Litecoin MWEB or even\nMonero to purchase an item online. However, you later discover that this\nplatform has been collecting user data and subsequently fell victim to a data\nbreach, exposing your shipping information, shopping history, along with\naddresses and payment details to an attacker. An absolute nightmare, even if the\ninitial payment was conducted through a private transaction.\n\nThis underscores the fact that private payments alone are insufficient to\ncompletely safeguard your shopping habits and selling history. This fact stands\nas a premise for the design of Particl Marketplace.\n\nParticl Marketplace is a decentralized, privacy-focused e-commerce platform\nbuilt using blockchain and peer-to-peer technology. Unlike traditional\ne-commerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, Etsy, or Alibaba, Particl Marketplace\noperates without intermediaries, ensuring secure and private transactions\nbetween users, free from fees or restrictions. Buyers and sellers transact\ndirectly, benefiting from a two-party escrow system that protects both parties\nand keeps all trade information private to the involved parties only.\n\nUsing Litecoin for Shopping on Particl Marketplace Soon to be AvailableWhile the\nplatform's unapologetically decentralized nature and privacy features make it an\nattractive alternative to centralized e-commerce platforms (which often face\ncensorship, data breaches, and other vulnerabilities), it is currently limited\nto using PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, as the settlement currency. This\nis due to PART’s unique technology being an integral component in enabling some\nof the marketplace's unique features in the first place.\n\nBasicSwap DEX: Enabling Multi-Currency Payments\nLitecoin MWEB Balances and Conversions Live on BasicSwap DEXLitecoin\nMimbleWimble balances and balance conversions are now live on BasicSwap DEX, a\nfirst step towards full MWEB swaps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/litecoin-mweb-balances-and-conversions-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\nBasicSwap DEX is a decentralized exchange protocol and platform powered by\natomic swaps and SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a distributed data and\nmessaging protocol (often referred to as a “mixnet”). It offers a non-custodial\nand privacy-first trading experience, enabling trustless cross-chain swaps\nbetween different cryptocurrencies across various blockchains. And just like\nParticl Marketplace, it imposes no fees, restrictions, or data collection\npractices.\n\nAnd while it has always included Litecoin since its inception, it recently\nintegrated MWEB balances, paving the way for full MWEB swaps once Litecoin's\nupcoming core update — which will detect incoming Litecoin transactions using\nonly the viewkey without requiring the spendkey — goes live.\n\nTrade Litecoin on BasicSwap DEX (Litecoin DEX)By integrating BasicSwap into\nParticl Marketplace, alternative payment options are introduced at the time of\ncheckout, allowing users to seamlessly pay for items using their preferred\ncryptocurrency, a prime candidate of which being the fast and private Litecoin\nMWEB token.\n\nThis synergy aligns perfectly with Litecoin's vision of becoming a viable and\npractical form of digital cash, providing an additional real-world use case that\nfurther solidifies its position.\n\nBuilding Bridges Between Cryptocurrencies\nThe upcoming integration of BasicSwap and Litecoin MWEB on Particl Marketplace\nexemplifies BasicSwap's broader mission of forging bridges between diverse\ncryptocurrency communities and projects through its cross-chain functionality.\nThis synergy unites our efforts toward a shared vision of building a global\neconomy that prioritizes sovereignty and interoperability - the great promise of\ncrypto.\n\nBy enabling the use of Litecoin on Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap fosters a\nsymbiotic relationship that holds immense promise. Cultivating interoperability\nbetween the two ecosystems will accelerate the adoption of Litecoin as a\npractical, decentralized, and privacy-focused payment solution, while further\npositioning Particl as an enabler of financial activities beyond simple\npeer-to-peer transactions.\n\nIf you share this vision, we invite you to join the Particl and BasicSwap\ncommunity as we build towards a sovereign future and contribute to the mission,\nwhether through code or spreading awareness within the Litecoin community\nitself. As the economy is fundamentally a social phenomenon, every contribution,\nbig or small, propels us forward.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

This is the future\nof BasicSwap, the atomic swap-based decentralized exchange that promises to be a\ncornerstone of the Particl ecosystem, and a catalyst for the growth of\ndecentralized commerce.\n\nThe Particl Ecosystem: A Beacon of Privacy Against Fiat\nParticl, through a multitude of modular privacy apps, can be understood as an\necosystem designed to respect individuals’ rights, freedoms, and privacy without\ncompromise. \n\nAt the core of the Particl project is the Particl Marketplace, a decentralized\ne-commerce platform that allows buyers and sellers to transact directly without\nintermediaries. This platform is complemented by a suite of privacy-focused\nprotocols that enable users to conduct various activities without relying on\nthird-party service providers.\n\nHowever, as Particl seeks to establish itself as a truly independent and\nself-sustaining ecosystem, a glaring issue has been a lack of avenues for\ninteracting effectively with the Marketplace, and the accessibility shortcomings\nthis represents. \n\nUntil recently, users have had to rely on centralized exchanges or unprotected\nover-the-counter (OTC) deals to acquire PART, the native currency of Particl\nMarketplace settlements, which undermines the platform's core principles of\nprivacy and autonomy.\n\nBridging the Gap: Bringing Decentralized Commerce to All Crypto\nWhile BasicSwap currently functions as an open-source decentralized exchange\napplication designed to facilitate trustless and anonymous trading of digital\nassets for all, its essence transcends that of a mere application; it is\nprimarily a protocol. This distinction, though seemingly minor on the surface,\ncarries profound implications for the future usage and purpose of BasicSwap.\n\nBy integrating it with the Particl Marketplace, thus providing to it\nBasicSwap-powered swap services such as a multi-currency payment option during\ncheckout, it promises to bridge the gap between privacy and decentralized\ncommerce, enabling users to interact with the Particl Marketplace using their\npreferred currency, while seamlessly converting the payment into PART in order\nto interact with certain aspects of the marketplace itself, such as Particl’s\nunique two-party escrow system\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-marketplace/marketplace_escrow.html]\n. The end result is a smooth experience where customers can pay for items in\ntheir preferred currency, which is then converted into PART in the background,\nproviding value to both the end-user and the Particl community of holders.\n\nBenefits that Extend Beyond the Usefulness of Multi-Currency Payments\nOne of the key advantages of BasicSwap is its ability to leverage atomic swap\ntechnology, specifically adaptor signatures, to allow users to exchange\ndifferent cryptocurrencies privately and without the need for a centralized\nintermediary. This not only enhances user security, it also opens up new\npossibilities for inter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects\nand their unique benefits.\n\nImagine a scenario where you wish to purchase an item on the Particl Marketplace\nusing Firo, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that employs the Lelantus protocol\nfor anonymity. With BasicSwap, you can initiate the transaction by sending your\nFiro to a designated address provided by the DEX. \n\nThe coins are then \"burned,\" and the Firo redeem token is exchanged for\nanonymous PART using BasicSwap, which is then used to complete the purchase on\nthe Particl Marketplace. Of course, all of this would happen behind the scenes,\nthe end-user being left with an easy-to-follow and comprehensive user experience\nakin to choosing a “checkout option” on traditional marketplaces.\n\nThis simple act demonstrates the power of atomic swap technology, effectively\ncombining the unique benefits of whatever coin is used as the checkout payment\noption (Firo, Monero, Litecoin MWEB, etc) and RingCT (the privacy protocol used\nby PART) in a single transaction. \n\nBy enabling such inter-compatibility between privacy technologies, BasicSwap\nunlocks a world of possibilities for users seeking to maintain their financial\nprivacy while engaging in decentralized commerce.\n\nThe Implications of a Truly Decentralized and Agnostic Payment System\nWhile the focus of BasicSwap is on bridging privacy projects and privacy coins,\nits true potential extends far beyond this scope. By offering a truly\ndecentralized and agnostic payment system, the BasicSwap protocol opens the door\nto a wide range of use cases and possibilities.\n\nOne exciting prospect is the integration of stablecoins, which could provide a\nmore stable and predictable means of value transfer within the Particl\necosystem. This could be particularly beneficial for e-commerce transactions,\nwhere price volatility can be a concern when cryptocurrency is involved.\n\nMoreover, the potential for anonymous stablecoins, or of anonymous swaps of\nexisting stablecoins, raises intriguing possibilities for enhancing financial\nprivacy while maintaining the benefits of price stability. As the technology\nevolves, BasicSwap's agnostic nature positions it to seamlessly integrate and\nfacilitate the use of such innovative financial instruments within the Particl\nMarketplace and beyond.\n\nConclusion: A Cornerstone for Decentralized Commerce\nThe integration of BasicSwap with the Particl Marketplace represents a\nsignificant milestone in our journey towards financial sovereignty. By providing\na robust and decentralized platform for trading PART and facilitating\ninter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects, BasicSwap is\npoised to become a cornerstone of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nAs the world increasingly recognizes the importance of privacy and autonomy in\nfinancial transactions, platforms like Particl and BasicSwap are poised to lead\nthe way in fostering a truly decentralized and privacy-focused economic\nenvironment. \n\nWith its commitment to agnosticism and its ability to adapt to emerging\ntechnologies, BasicSwap has the potential to revolutionize the way we think\nabout decentralized commerce, paving the way for a future where individuals can\ntransact freely, securely, and without the need for trusted third parties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
