an\nupdate to its user interface, now at version 3.1.\n\nThis substantial update represents weeks of dedicated effort, incorporating\nnumerous improvements, bug fixes, and new features. The changes stem from\nextensive testing by both contributors and community members, resulting in a\nsignificant step forward for user experience and platform stability.\n\nThis update welcomes Bitcoin Cash and implements several key improvements across\nall aspects of the platform, including changes to the codebase, the user\ninterface, and to individual coin integrations such as Monero.\n\nNotably, a key technical change is the complete replacement of SQLAlchemy with\nmanbearpigSQL, our custom-built hybrid database system. This transition\nsimplifies BasicSwap's data management processes while solidifying security by\neliminating potential vulnerabilities.\n\nWe extend special thanks to Ofrnxmr, Mbacoinin, and mainnet_pat for their code\ncontributions this month, as well as to our dedicated community members who have\nhelped identify bugs and areas for improvement through thorough testing and\nfeedback.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week has been a continuation of the work we've mentioned in last week's\nupdate, though we've got exciting and exclusive news to share.\n\nBitcoin Cash Integration Update ?\nAs announced earlier today on X by mainnet_pat\n[https://x.com/mainnet_pat/status/1857335162125648102], one of the main\ncontributors to the BCH <> XMR atomic swap protocol, the integration of Bitcoin\nCash on BasicSwap DEX has been extensively tested on mainnet and is now ready\nfor release.\n\nWe have thus merged a substantial series of commits\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commits/dev/?before=732c87b0130b57062a9693a203f96c50a6413555+35] \nto the dev branch (more specifically, commits dated today November 15th),\nenabling users to test the Bitcoin Cash integration on mainnet. We anticipate\nbringing this integration to the master branch during our next dev -> master \nmerge.\n\nCommits · basicswap/basicswapBasic Atomic Swap Proof of Concept. Contribute to\nbasicswap/basicswap development by creating an account on GitHub.GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commits/dev/?before=732c87b0130b57062a9693a203f96c50a6413555+35]\nWe extend our sincere gratitude to mainnet_pat for his exceptional work on this\nintegration. This valuable community contribution strengthens BasicSwap's\ndecentralized approach and represents another significant step toward achieving\nour mission.\n\nBasicSwap Codebase Improvements ✅\nAlong with today's large array of commits that have been added to the dev \nbranch, we've included a number of general codebase improvements and code\nclean-ups.\n\nNotably, we've resolved an issue with Monero wallets which should resolve a\nlong-standing issue that made BasicSwap become slower the longer you had been\nrunning your instance. This fix is a combination of BasicSwap improvements and\naccompanying fixes that have been published as pull requests to Monero earlier\ntoday (1 [https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/9571], 2\n[https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/9570]).\n\nOther updates, committed on November 15th\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commits/dev], include:\n\n * Large code formatting update, including tests (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/732c87b0130b57062a9693a203f96c50a6413555]\n   , 2\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/7b03ce476997ceee5f6b227c8a1b028175ed5b74]\n   )\n * Allow setting reserve below increment for market making script (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/373525b364249c493cc4dbd90fcfd62c38f009ff]\n   )\n * basicswap-prepare: don't start daemon if coin config exists in basicswap.json\n   (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/6be9a14335ac5b7893b231fd33983462bf90a93c]\n   )\n * Bypass Tor for .local domains (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/b484827c15fdc306a9dc8b6ce52117371142dcc0]\n   )\n * Fix error when txid is unknown (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/51c11793265045edce7239372748dc74cfea2664]\n   )\n * Fix unbound error when no wallet data is cached (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/b5f6eb65262fed1b731003b8248e34db57a32b45]\n   )\n * Adjust wallet name for Particl anon and blind interfaces (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/e28d41ed0caf4c3c28e6fbbf4d3385b48f7f38d6]\n   )\n * Add display_name to chainparams (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/00d70f8cc72096f6f132d108a453d0512ad22c47]\n   )\n\nBasicSwap Windows Installer ?‍♂️\nWhile we have completed the majority of work on the new Windows installer as\nreported last week, we've chosen to focus this week's front-end efforts on\nBasicSwap GUI updates. These updates will begin rolling out to the dev branch in\ngreater numbers over the next few days.\n\nThe installer release remains imminent. However, we want to clarify that this\ninstaller is simply a tool to facilitate building BasicSwap DEX from source on\nWindows. For Windows users, we continue to recommend using the Docker version,\nwhich remains our only officially supported Windows implementation.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nMulti-Net Support ?\nMultinet by tecnovert · Pull Request #311 · basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
