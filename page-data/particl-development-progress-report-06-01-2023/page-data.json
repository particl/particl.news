So let's quickly see what progress has been made in the past\nfew days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nOver the past week, our team has been focused on testing and executing minor\nadjustments for Particl Desktop 3.3. We have also been preparing for the\ncommencement of the upcoming development cycle and carefully assessing the most\neffective transition strategy to ensure a smooth process.\n\nWe are pleased to report that no significant issue has been found so far. As\nsuch, we are confident that the release will be ready for launch in the near\nfuture although we cannot communicate a precise mainnet release date yet.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. \n\nThis week, we have been working on a complex Bitcoin merge which has been\nrequiring a significant amount of time. \n\nAs highlighted in our yearly recap on Particl News, it is critical to maintain\nup-to-date upstream updates from Bitcoin in order to benefit from the entire\npool of talent and associated security, usability, and other improvements.\n\nThis is evident from CryptoMiso rankings [https://www.cryptomiso.com], where\nParticl Core currently ranks 11th out of all the coins listed. Additionally, the\nvisualisation below shows the code updates made to Particl Core in 2022, and the\nnumber of developers working on the project, directly or indirectly. \n\nYou can monitor these changes by visiting this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week's more intricate Bitcoin merges have required a significant amount of\ntime.\n\nNonetheless, we have managed to address a few issues, particularly with the\nDocker-based configurations when executing BasicSwap in an isolated environment.\nAdditionally, we have remedied a bug that was causing the DEX to sometimes fail\nto validate the Bitcoin snapshot against its corresponding public key.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nWe have seen significant progress in regards to updating the user interface this\nweek. A wide array of fixes, optimizations, and enhancements have been included,\nand the offer table has been restructured to be more comprehensive and\nuser-friendly. This adds to the current ongoing tasks, which are the following:\n\n * Integrating the new subfee feature to make coin withdrawals and offer posting\n   easier (no need to manually calculate fees) into the GUI.\n * Addition of a dark mode.\n * Addition of a \"simple\" mode for the GUI in which the user interface is\n   slimmed down. This aims at simplifying the user experience but still allowing\n   for more advanced options via a \"simple/advanced\" toggler.\n * Addition of a new price charting system. The current chart style will still\n   be available and it'll be possible to select which one you want to use via\n   the settings page.\n * Introduction of a wide variety of GUI improvements, tweaks, and changes based\n   on feedback from our beta testers.\n\nWe anticipate deploying the changes shortly, allowing all users to update their\nlocal BasicSwap instances and take advantage of the new features.\n\nYear 2022 in Recap ?\n2022 in Review and What’s Coming in 2023Taking a look back at all the progress\nmade in 2022 and a glimpse of the future.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/2022-in-review/]Earlier this week, we proudly published a\ncomprehensive overview of the year 2022 and a glimpse of what's to come in 2023\nand beyond.

the Particl project, we'd like\nto take a moment to look back on 2022 and review all the exciting releases,\nnews, and surprises it brought with it.\n\nBut that's not all! We are pleased to offer a sneak peek into the future and\ngive a glimpse of what to expect marching through what is sure to be an even\nmore exciting year for the project!\n\nLet’s not waste a second more and dive right into it!\n\nTable of Contents\n * Particl Core\n * Particl Desktop\n * BasicSwap DEX\n * Particl Electrum\n * Particl Stories\n * What to Expect in 2023\n * Roadmap\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe year 2022 was a tumultuous one in the world of cryptocurrency, with a number\nof dramatic events occurring within the industry.\n\nFortunately, the Particl project managed to remain largely unaffected by these\ndevelopments, instead making significant progress towards its mission of\nproviding an ecosystem with unrivaled levels of privacy and decentralization.\n\nIndeed, all throughout the year, we have seen considerable development and code\nreleases on the project's Github [https://github.com/particl]. What's more, in\nJune, we unveiled our new vision for the platform's infrastructure, one designed\nto be fully open, modular, and incorporate a multitude of new and cutting-edge\ncapabilities. This strategic refocus is essential in advancing Particl and\nfacilitating its adoption by a broader audience.\n\nBut before we continue to discuss what's in store for the future, let us take a\nstep back and recognize the accomplishments that have been achieved throughout\nthe year.\n\nParticl Core\nGitHub - particl/particl-core: Particl Core integration/staging treeParticl\nCore\nintegration/staging tree. Contribute to particl/particl-core development by\ncreating an account on GitHub.GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core]Particl Core, the platform’s\nblockchain, is precisely what its name implies; it is the backbone of the PART\ncryptocurrency and powers safe and private currency transactions using the PART\ncoin — complete with a wide range of features like private transactions,\nsmart-contracts, and advanced financial capabilities to be used in intricate\ndecentralized applications.\n\nOne important particularity of the Particl blockchain is that it is forked from\nBitcoin and is actively maintained up-to-date with all its upstream updates —\nproviding you with the assurance that your funds are secure and that the\nplatform has the necessary capabilities to provide all the modern, enhanced\nfunctionality of Bitcoin.\n\nThe significance of this cannot be overstated. By leveraging the Bitcoin\ndeveloper community, the Particl ecosystem directly benefits from its entire\ntalent pool. This can be easily seen by simply examining blockchain Github\nrankings, like CryptoMiso [https://www.cryptomiso.com/] for example, where the\nParticl Core repository currently ranks 11th out of all the coins listed.\n\nThis is a testament to the strength of open-source development and its global\ncollective of dedicated contributors embodying its vision in their everyday\nlives.\n\nReleases\n * Jan 9, 2022 — Particl Core 0.21.2.6\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.6]\n * Jan 17, 2022 — Particl Core 0.19.2.19\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.19]\n * Feb 1, 2022 — Taproot goes live on mainnet (Particl Core 0.19.2.18\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.18]) *\n * Feb 8, 2022 — Particl Core 0.19.2.19\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.19]\n * Feb 24, 2022 — Particl Core 0.19.2.19\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.19]\n * Apr 13, 2022 — Particl Core 0.19.2.20\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.20]\n * Apr 15, 2022 — Particl Core 0.21.2.8\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.8]\n * Apr 15, 2022 — Particl Core 22.0.2\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v22.0.2.0]\n * Apr 16, 2022 — Particl Core 23.0.2.0\n   [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v23.0.2.0]\n * Apr 25, 2022 — Particl Core 0.21.2.9\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.9]\n * Aug 4, 2022 — Particl Core 0.19.2.21\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.21]\n * Aug 4, 2022 — Particl Core 0.21.2.10\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.10]\n * Aug 20, 2022 — Particl Core 0.19.2.22\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.22]\n * Aug 21, 2022 — Particl Core 0.21.2.11\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.11]\n * Aug 21, 2022 — Particl Core 22.0.3\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v22.0.3.0]\n * Oct 2, 2022 — Particl Core 24.0.1.0 RC1\n   [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v24.0.1.0rc1]\n * Nov 12, 2022 — Particl Core 23.0.3\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v23.0.3.0]\n\n* Particl Core 0.19.2.18 was released on December 13, 2021, but the Taproot\nhardfork was pre-scheduled to go live on the 1st of February, 2022.\n\nParticl Desktop\nGitHub - particl/particl-desktop: The GUI application for Particl Markeplace\nand\nPART coin wallet.

A decentralized peer to peer marketplace –free, secure, private,\nuntraceable. - GitHub - particl/particl-desktop: The GUI applicatio...GitHub\nparticl [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/]This year's recap is also a\ngreat reminder that Particl is far more than a 'privacy coin.' It is, indeed, a\ncomprehensive ecosystem of privacy-first dApps that prioritize privacy and\ndecentralization above all else.\n\nAs such, the ecosystem requires user-oriented gateways, or user interfaces,\nthrough which you can interact with applications like the Particl Marketplace.\nWithout it, you would be limited to only a command-line or basic Qt-like\ninterfaces, both of which being less-than-optimal user experiences.\n\nThat’s where Particl Desktop comes in. It is a desktop client which provides\nusers with a unified and user-friendly interface for interacting with a suite of\napplications. Its current functions include acting as a cryptocurrency wallet\nmanagement, a decentralized marketplace, and a decentralized autonomous\norganization (DAO) governance portal. In 2023 and beyond, its scope will expand\nto include a multitude of additional features and capabilities, becoming more\nakin to a \"dApp OS\", but more on that further down below this article.\n\nThere’s no denying. Particl Desktop is a vital element within the Particl\necosystem, and, similar to Particl Core, it has been improved multiple times\nthroughout 2022.\n\nReleases\n * Jan 4, 2022 — v3.1.0\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.0]\n * Feb 4, 2022 — v3.1.1\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.1]\n * Apr 12, 2022 — v3.1.2\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.2]\n * Apr 14 2022 — v3.1.3\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.3]\n * May 9, 2022 — v3.2.0\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0]\n * Jun 29, 2022 — v3.2.1\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.1]\n * Jul 1, 2022 — v3.2.2\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.2]\n * Dec 24, 2022 — v3.3.0-RC001\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0-testing-RC001] \n    (testnet ongoing) *\n\n* Particl Desktop 3.3 is a transitory release into the new development cycle\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/].\n\nBasicSwap DEX\nGitHub - tecnovert/basicswap: Basic Atomic Swap Proof of ConceptBasic Atomic\nSwap Proof of Concept. Contribute to tecnovert/basicswap development by\ncreating\nan account on GitHub.GitHubtecnovert [https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap]\nPerhaps the most exciting release of the year, BasicSwap is Particl’s brand new\ndApp. Indeed, the simultaneous failure of the FTX scam exchange and the release\nof the BasicSwap DEX proved to be an opportune moment for Particl, as it brought\nconsiderable attention to the platform and its mission.\n\nIt is a peer-to-peer (P2P) trading exchange that offers a secure, private, and\ncompletely decentralized trading platform. It eliminates the need for central\npoints of failure or third-party interferences, allowing you to freely swap\ncryptocurrencies with full confidence and in total privacy. This groundbreaking\ndApp is sure to revolutionize the way people trade cryptocurrencies, and is a\nmajor milestone in the evolution of both the Particl project and the broader\ncryptocurrency industry.\n\nBasicSwap was released to the public, on the 7th of December, 2022, as an open\nbeta. The DEX, which functions over mainnet networks, is fully functional for a\nvariety of coins [https://basicswapdex.com/markets] (including Monero).\n\nHowever, it’s important to keep in mind that BasicSwap is still in its early\nstages and is currently better geared for more experienced users.

Indeed, we’ve achieved numerous milestones that have\npositioned us well for the coming year, and we are eager to share what comes\nnext with you.\n\nA New Development Cycle Begins\nIt may have been a few months since we’ve announced Particl’s upcoming\ndevelopment cycle\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/], but with the\nimminent mainnet release of Particl Desktop 3.3, the time has finally come for\nit to start taking form.\n\nParticl's upcoming development cycle is set to revolutionize the ecosystem's\narchitecture, making it modular in design and more open to external\ncontributors. In summary, it bases itself on four pillars:\n\n1- SMSG 2.0 — A Decentralized & Private Internet Protocol\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#1-smsg-2-0-a-decentralized-and-private-internet-protocol]\n:\n\nA major deliverable of Particl’s upcoming development cycle is a new, enhanced\nversion of the SMSG network — Particl’s privacy-first peer-to-peer data network\npowering its dApps like Particl Marketplace or BasicSwap DEX.\n\nThis update intends to make the network faster, but also much more scalable and\nable to sustain consumer-levels of traffic, as well as provide additional\nfunctionality such as hosting, directly on its network, applications, web pages,\nand other types of data or content.\n\n2- A New Modular Architecture\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#2-giving-particl-a-modular-dimension]\n:\n\nPerhaps the most important aspect of this development cycle is the breaking down\nof Particl components into independent modules that can interact with each\nother, but without depending on one another.\n\nThis will facilitate greater contributions to the ecosystem, and will reduce the\noverhead of upkeep for each application or initiative, regardless of whether\nthey are developed by the Particl team or community contributors.\n\nAdditionally, the introduction of a developer SDK and a more streamlined\ndevelopment process for the entire ecosystem will enable improved\ninteroperability of the modules, allowing developers to leverage the\ncontributions of others to incorporate functionality into their own dApps or\nservices.\n\n3- Access Gateways and dApp Accessibility\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#3-a-greater-focus-on-access-gateways-and-dapp-accessibility]\n:\n\nOne of the main benefits of implementing a modular and open architecture is the\nease of integration into third-party applications. For instance, BasicSwap could\nbe readily integrated into popular cryptocurrency wallets, drastically improving\nthe exposure of the ecosystem as a whole by exposing it to an entirely new\naudience.\n\nBut the reverse is equally true: it also makes it simpler to incorporate\nthird-party services, such as advanced eCommerce inventory management systems,\ninto Particl dApps like Particl Marketplace.\n\nThis will, notably, enable a broader range of gateways to interact with\ndecentralized applications. These can include web and mobile frameworks,\nallowing users to access the marketplace, for example, from any location as long\nas they can get an internet connection and access to a web browser.\n\nThe changes brought by this new development cycle will bring an unprecedented\nlevel of accessibility, user-friendliness, and intuitive design while\nmaintaining a high degree of privacy and decentralization. This will position\nthe platform perfectly for adoption, as people will now be able to enjoy the\nbenefits of a secure and decentralized system without sacrificing too much\nconvenience.\n\n4- Currency and Protocol Agnosticism\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#4-a-commitment-to-agnosticism]\n:\n\nIt is well established that any technology-based platform that fails to embrace\nthe ever-evolving nature of the industry it inhabits will not be able to sustain\nitself in the long run. As technology advances at an accelerated rate, platforms\nmust be able to adapt to the changing landscape in order to remain viable.\n\nAs such, Particl’s upcoming development cycle will introduce a much larger\ndegree of agnosticism with the currencies that can be used on the platform, but\nalso with the protocols that can power its dApps.\n\nCurrently, Particl dApps only work using either the Particl blockchain, the SMSG\nnetwork, or some combination of both. While this is a viable solution in many\nways, it hinders the platform's ability to gain traction beyond its existing\nuser base, and overlooks the potential advantages that alternative protocols may\nbe able to provide.\n\nThis is why we want to move ahead as a truly open project, embracing various\ncryptocurrencies and protocols with the aim of providing the best levels of\nprivacy, freedom, and self-empowerment to the greatest number of humans as\npossible.\n\nBut don’t be afraid! PART will continue to play a central role in the coming\ncycle. It offers capabilities that are not available with other\ncryptocurrencies, particularly in terms of its unique ability to combine privacy\nand flexibility. We also fully expect that many future decentralized\napplications will require PART and its unique capabilities in order to simply\nfunction.\n\nAdditionally, the proposed changes will greatly facilitate the development of\napplications and services, many of which can be creatively monetized by their\ncreators to the benefit of the network. We anticipate that these changes will\nresult in a net and significant increase in PART usage, while bringing real\nvalue to other cryptocurrencies as well.\n\nCurrent Roadmap\nTo adequately map out the path forward as we progress through the upcoming\ndevelopment cycle, we’ve published a roadmap which marks the most important\nmilestones. It is separated into two main phases: the foundational phase and the\ndeployment phase.\n\nThe foundational phase is dedicated to constructing a modular and open\narchitecture for the ecosystem. The deployment phase, on the other hand,\ninvolves integrating the new foundation design into existing dApps, integrating\nthem into new gateways (i.e., web access), and developing new applications and\nservices (or variants of current ones) as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we reach the deployment phase of the roadmap, the Particl ecosystem will be\nfully open and modular; primed to receive a wide range of contributions from the\ncommunity. This will enable the integration of dApps into third-party platforms,\nwhich is likely to result in a significant snowball or domino effect on all\nfronts.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd there we have it, the full review of 2022 and a glimpse of what to expect in\n2023 and beyond.\n\nWith the project maturing into an ever-more useful and integrated ecosystem, it\nis clear that it is becoming increasingly relevant and pivotal in the face of\nthe new challenges our world faces.\n\nWe'd like to express our most sincere gratitude to you all in the community for\nyour passion, contributions, and trust. We promise to always  keep pushing\nboundaries and give everything we've got to make 2023 the most exciting year for\nParticl yet!\n\nCheers to all of you in this awesome community — the power to change the world\nfor the better lies in our collective hands! ?\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

It is, indeed, a comprehensive ecosystem of privacy-first dApps that prioritize privacy and decentralization above all else.</p><p>As such, the ecosystem requires user-oriented gateways, or user interfaces, through which you can interact with applications like the Particl Marketplace. Without it, you would be limited to only a command-line or basic Qt-like interfaces, both of which being less-than-optimal user experiences.</p><p>That’s where Particl Desktop comes in. It is a desktop client which provides users with a unified and user-friendly interface for interacting with a suite of applications. Its current functions include acting as a cryptocurrency wallet management, a decentralized marketplace, and a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance portal. In 2023 and beyond, its scope will expand to include a multitude of additional features and capabilities, becoming more akin to a \"dApp OS\", but more on that further down below this article.</p><p>There’s no denying.

Additionally, you must ensure that the blockchains of the coins you have enabled are synced locally on your device.</p><p>But don’t despair, this is merely the first step in a more comprehensive and end-user friendly vision for the DEX, which we will expound upon in the second half of this blog post.</p><h3 id=\"releases-2\">Releases</h3><ul><li><strong>Nov 30, 2022 — </strong><a href=\"https://BasicSwapDEX.com/\">BasicSwap.com Website Release</a></li><li><strong>Dec 7, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://particl.news/basicswap-open-beta-is-now-live/\">BSX Open Beta</a></li></ul><h2 id=\"particl-electrum\">Particl Electrum</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/particl/electrum\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">GitHub - particl/electrum: Electrum Particl Wallet</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Electrum Particl Wallet.

Indeed, we’ve achieved numerous milestones that have positioned us well for the coming year, and we are eager to share what comes next with you.</p><h3 id=\"a-new-development-cycle-begins\">A New Development Cycle Begins</h3><p>It may have been a few months since we’ve announced <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/\">Particl’s upcoming development cycle</a>, but with the imminent mainnet release of Particl Desktop 3.3, the time has finally come for it to start taking form.</p><p>Particl's upcoming development cycle is set to revolutionize the ecosystem's architecture, making it modular in design and more open to external contributors. In summary, it bases itself on four pillars:</p><p>1- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#1-smsg-2-0-a-decentralized-and-private-internet-protocol\"><strong>SMSG 2.0 — A Decentralized &amp; Private Internet Protocol</strong></a>:</p><p>A major deliverable of Particl’s upcoming development cycle is a new, enhanced version of the SMSG network — Particl’s privacy-first peer-to-peer data network powering its dApps like Particl Marketplace or BasicSwap DEX.</p><p>This update intends to make the network faster, but also much more scalable and able to sustain consumer-levels of traffic, as well as provide additional functionality such as hosting, directly on its network, applications, web pages, and other types of data or content.</p><p>2- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#2-giving-particl-a-modular-dimension\"><strong>A New Modular Architecture</strong></a>:</p><p>Perhaps the most important aspect of this development cycle is the breaking down of Particl components into independent modules that can interact with each other, but without depending on one another.</p><p>This will facilitate greater contributions to the ecosystem, and will reduce the overhead of upkeep for each application or initiative, regardless of whether they are developed by the Particl team or community contributors.</p><p>Additionally, the introduction of a developer SDK and a more streamlined development process for the entire ecosystem will enable improved interoperability of the modules, allowing developers to leverage the contributions of others to incorporate functionality into their own dApps or services.</p><p>3- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#3-a-greater-focus-on-access-gateways-and-dapp-accessibility\"><strong>Access Gateways and dApp Accessibility</strong></a>:</p><p>One of the main benefits of implementing a modular and open architecture is the ease of integration into third-party applications. For instance, BasicSwap could be readily integrated into popular cryptocurrency wallets, drastically improving the exposure of the ecosystem as a whole by exposing it to an entirely new audience.</p><p>But the reverse is equally true: it also makes it simpler to incorporate third-party services, such as advanced eCommerce inventory management systems, into Particl dApps like Particl Marketplace.</p><p>This will, notably, enable a broader range of gateways to interact with decentralized applications. These can include web and mobile frameworks, allowing users to access the marketplace, for example, from any location as long as they can get an internet connection and access to a web browser.</p><p>The changes brought by this new development cycle will bring an unprecedented level of accessibility, user-friendliness, and intuitive design while maintaining a high degree of privacy and decentralization. This will position the platform perfectly for adoption, as people will now be able to enjoy the benefits of a secure and decentralized system without sacrificing too much convenience.</p><p>4- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#4-a-commitment-to-agnosticism\"><strong>Currency and Protocol Agnosticism</strong></a>:</p><p>It is well established that any technology-based platform that fails to embrace the ever-evolving nature of the industry it inhabits will not be able to sustain itself in the long run. As technology advances at an accelerated rate, platforms must be able to adapt to the changing landscape in order to remain viable.</p><p>As such, Particl’s upcoming development cycle will introduce a much larger degree of agnosticism with the currencies that can be used on the platform, but also with the protocols that can power its dApps.</p><p>Currently, Particl dApps only work using either the Particl blockchain, the SMSG network, or some combination of both. While this is a viable solution in many ways, it hinders the platform's ability to gain traction beyond its existing user base, and overlooks the potential advantages that alternative protocols may be able to provide.</p><p>This is why we want to move ahead as a truly open project, embracing various cryptocurrencies and protocols with the aim of providing the best levels of privacy, freedom, and self-empowerment to the greatest number of humans as possible.</p><p>But don’t be afraid! PART will continue to play a central role in the coming cycle. It offers capabilities that are not available with other cryptocurrencies, particularly in terms of its unique ability to combine privacy and flexibility. We also fully expect that many future decentralized applications will require PART and its unique capabilities in order to simply function.</p><p>Additionally, the proposed changes will greatly facilitate the development of applications and services, many of which can be creatively monetized by their creators to the benefit of the network. We anticipate that these changes will result in a net and significant increase in PART usage, while bringing real value to other cryptocurrencies as well.</p><h3 id=\"current-roadmap\">Current Roadmap</h3><p>To adequately map out the path forward as we progress through the upcoming development cycle, we’ve published a roadmap which marks the most important milestones. It is separated into two main phases: the foundational phase and the deployment phase.</p><p>The foundational phase is dedicated to constructing a modular and open architecture for the ecosystem. The deployment phase, on the other hand, involves integrating the new foundation design into existing dApps, integrating them into new gateways (i.e., web access), and developing new applications and services (or variants of current ones) as well.</p><p></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CbSmkQORjugImKLG964tdEtrP3JCH-zXg-DxpO43cM9b5m5-3i7IduM5aeIIXFdnPXXJKQ-TilmOddX2yHqnTjYlczHTZfsjTrpod-ZNVWw06gHCT1E_sXVkD-WNFVe_GVaKUSkmlEprhu6pJGsaeSc9ic9zUODTNIHLGENu2n80GpAtFhlL_WNGiOWmiA\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p></p><p>Once we reach the deployment phase of the roadmap, the Particl ecosystem will be fully open and modular; primed to receive a wide range of contributions from the community. This will enable the integration of dApps into third-party platforms, which is likely to result in a significant snowball or domino effect on all fronts.</p><hr><p>And there we have it, the full review of 2022 and a glimpse of what to expect in 2023 and beyond.</p><p>With the project maturing into an ever-more useful and integrated ecosystem, it is clear that it is becoming increasingly relevant and pivotal in the face of the new challenges our world faces.</p><p>We'd like to express our most sincere gratitude to you all in the community for your passion, contributions, and trust. We promise to always  keep pushing boundaries and give everything we've got to make 2023 the most exciting year for Particl yet!</p><p>Cheers to all of you in this awesome community — the power to change the world for the better lies in our collective hands! ?</p><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

It is, indeed, a comprehensive ecosystem of privacy-first dApps that prioritize privacy and decentralization above all else.</p><p>As such, the ecosystem requires user-oriented gateways, or user interfaces, through which you can interact with applications like the Particl Marketplace. Without it, you would be limited to only a command-line or basic Qt-like interfaces, both of which being less-than-optimal user experiences.</p><p>That’s where Particl Desktop comes in. It is a desktop client which provides users with a unified and user-friendly interface for interacting with a suite of applications. Its current functions include acting as a cryptocurrency wallet management, a decentralized marketplace, and a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance portal. In 2023 and beyond, its scope will expand to include a multitude of additional features and capabilities, becoming more akin to a \"dApp OS\", but more on that further down below this article.</p><p>There’s no denying. Particl Desktop is a vital element within the Particl ecosystem, and, similar to Particl Core, it has been improved multiple times throughout 2022.</p><h3 id=\"releases-1\">Releases</h3><ul><li><strong>Jan 4, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.0\">v3.1.0</a></li><li><strong>Feb 4, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.1\">v3.1.1</a></li><li><strong>Apr 12, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.2\">v3.1.2</a></li><li><strong>Apr 14 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.3\">v3.1.3</a></li><li><strong>May 9, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0\">v3.2.0</a></li><li><strong>Jun 29, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.1\">v3.2.1</a></li><li><strong>Jul 1, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.2\">v3.2.2</a></li><li><strong>Dec 24, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0-testing-RC001\">v3.3.0-RC001</a> <em>(testnet ongoing) *</em></li></ul><p><em>* Particl Desktop 3.3 is a transitory release into </em><a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/\"><em>the new development cycle</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2 id=\"basicswap-dex\">BasicSwap DEX</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">GitHub - tecnovert/basicswap: Basic Atomic Swap Proof of Concept</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Basic Atomic Swap Proof of Concept.

It eliminates the need for central points of failure or third-party interferences, allowing you to freely swap cryptocurrencies with full confidence and in total privacy. This groundbreaking dApp is sure to revolutionize the way people trade cryptocurrencies, and is a major milestone in the evolution of both the Particl project and the broader cryptocurrency industry.</p><p>BasicSwap was released to the public, on the 7th of December, 2022, as an open beta. The DEX, which functions over mainnet networks, is fully functional for <a href=\"https://basicswapdex.com/markets\">a variety of coins</a> (including Monero).</p><p>However, it’s important to keep in mind that BasicSwap is still in its early stages and is currently better geared for more experienced users. To use it today, you must manually compile the Python code, which should only take a few minutes. Additionally, you must ensure that the blockchains of the coins you have enabled are synced locally on your device.</p><p>But don’t despair, this is merely the first step in a more comprehensive and end-user friendly vision for the DEX, which we will expound upon in the second half of this blog post.</p><h3 id=\"releases-2\">Releases</h3><ul><li><strong>Nov 30, 2022 — </strong><a href=\"https://BasicSwapDEX.com/\">BasicSwap.com Website Release</a></li><li><strong>Dec 7, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://particl.news/basicswap-open-beta-is-now-live/\">BSX Open Beta</a></li></ul><h2 id=\"particl-electrum\">Particl Electrum</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/particl/electrum\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">GitHub - particl/electrum: Electrum Particl Wallet</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Electrum Particl Wallet.

Indeed, we’ve achieved numerous milestones that have positioned us well for the coming year, and we are eager to share what comes next with you.</p><h3 id=\"a-new-development-cycle-begins\">A New Development Cycle Begins</h3><p>It may have been a few months since we’ve announced <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/\">Particl’s upcoming development cycle</a>, but with the imminent mainnet release of Particl Desktop 3.3, the time has finally come for it to start taking form.</p><p>Particl's upcoming development cycle is set to revolutionize the ecosystem's architecture, making it modular in design and more open to external contributors. In summary, it bases itself on four pillars:</p><p>1- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#1-smsg-2-0-a-decentralized-and-private-internet-protocol\"><strong>SMSG 2.0 — A Decentralized &#x26; Private Internet Protocol</strong></a>:</p><p>A major deliverable of Particl’s upcoming development cycle is a new, enhanced version of the SMSG network — Particl’s privacy-first peer-to-peer data network powering its dApps like Particl Marketplace or BasicSwap DEX.</p><p>This update intends to make the network faster, but also much more scalable and able to sustain consumer-levels of traffic, as well as provide additional functionality such as hosting, directly on its network, applications, web pages, and other types of data or content.</p><p>2- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#2-giving-particl-a-modular-dimension\"><strong>A New Modular Architecture</strong></a>:</p><p>Perhaps the most important aspect of this development cycle is the breaking down of Particl components into independent modules that can interact with each other, but without depending on one another.</p><p>This will facilitate greater contributions to the ecosystem, and will reduce the overhead of upkeep for each application or initiative, regardless of whether they are developed by the Particl team or community contributors.</p><p>Additionally, the introduction of a developer SDK and a more streamlined development process for the entire ecosystem will enable improved interoperability of the modules, allowing developers to leverage the contributions of others to incorporate functionality into their own dApps or services.</p><p>3- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#3-a-greater-focus-on-access-gateways-and-dapp-accessibility\"><strong>Access Gateways and dApp Accessibility</strong></a>:</p><p>One of the main benefits of implementing a modular and open architecture is the ease of integration into third-party applications. For instance, BasicSwap could be readily integrated into popular cryptocurrency wallets, drastically improving the exposure of the ecosystem as a whole by exposing it to an entirely new audience.</p><p>But the reverse is equally true: it also makes it simpler to incorporate third-party services, such as advanced eCommerce inventory management systems, into Particl dApps like Particl Marketplace.</p><p>This will, notably, enable a broader range of gateways to interact with decentralized applications. These can include web and mobile frameworks, allowing users to access the marketplace, for example, from any location as long as they can get an internet connection and access to a web browser.</p><p>The changes brought by this new development cycle will bring an unprecedented level of accessibility, user-friendliness, and intuitive design while maintaining a high degree of privacy and decentralization. This will position the platform perfectly for adoption, as people will now be able to enjoy the benefits of a secure and decentralized system without sacrificing too much convenience.</p><p>4- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#4-a-commitment-to-agnosticism\"><strong>Currency and Protocol Agnosticism</strong></a>:</p><p>It is well established that any technology-based platform that fails to embrace the ever-evolving nature of the industry it inhabits will not be able to sustain itself in the long run. As technology advances at an accelerated rate, platforms must be able to adapt to the changing landscape in order to remain viable.</p><p>As such, Particl’s upcoming development cycle will introduce a much larger degree of agnosticism with the currencies that can be used on the platform, but also with the protocols that can power its dApps.</p><p>Currently, Particl dApps only work using either the Particl blockchain, the SMSG network, or some combination of both. While this is a viable solution in many ways, it hinders the platform's ability to gain traction beyond its existing user base, and overlooks the potential advantages that alternative protocols may be able to provide.</p><p>This is why we want to move ahead as a truly open project, embracing various cryptocurrencies and protocols with the aim of providing the best levels of privacy, freedom, and self-empowerment to the greatest number of humans as possible.</p><p>But don’t be afraid! PART will continue to play a central role in the coming cycle. It offers capabilities that are not available with other cryptocurrencies, particularly in terms of its unique ability to combine privacy and flexibility. We also fully expect that many future decentralized applications will require PART and its unique capabilities in order to simply function.</p><p>Additionally, the proposed changes will greatly facilitate the development of applications and services, many of which can be creatively monetized by their creators to the benefit of the network. We anticipate that these changes will result in a net and significant increase in PART usage, while bringing real value to other cryptocurrencies as well.</p><h3 id=\"current-roadmap\">Current Roadmap</h3><p>To adequately map out the path forward as we progress through the upcoming development cycle, we’ve published a roadmap which marks the most important milestones. It is separated into two main phases: the foundational phase and the deployment phase.</p><p>The foundational phase is dedicated to constructing a modular and open architecture for the ecosystem. The deployment phase, on the other hand, involves integrating the new foundation design into existing dApps, integrating them into new gateways (i.e., web access), and developing new applications and services (or variants of current ones) as well.</p><p></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CbSmkQORjugImKLG964tdEtrP3JCH-zXg-DxpO43cM9b5m5-3i7IduM5aeIIXFdnPXXJKQ-TilmOddX2yHqnTjYlczHTZfsjTrpod-ZNVWw06gHCT1E_sXVkD-WNFVe_GVaKUSkmlEprhu6pJGsaeSc9ic9zUODTNIHLGENu2n80GpAtFhlL_WNGiOWmiA\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p></p><p>Once we reach the deployment phase of the roadmap, the Particl ecosystem will be fully open and modular; primed to receive a wide range of contributions from the community. This will enable the integration of dApps into third-party platforms, which is likely to result in a significant snowball or domino effect on all fronts.</p><hr><p>And there we have it, the full review of 2022 and a glimpse of what to expect in 2023 and beyond.</p><p>With the project maturing into an ever-more useful and integrated ecosystem, it is clear that it is becoming increasingly relevant and pivotal in the face of the new challenges our world faces.</p><p>We'd like to express our most sincere gratitude to you all in the community for your passion, contributions, and trust. We promise to always  keep pushing boundaries and give everything we've got to make 2023 the most exciting year for Particl yet!</p><p>Cheers to all of you in this awesome community — the power to change the world for the better lies in our collective hands! ?</p><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nMulti-Net Support ?\nMultinet by tecnovert · Pull Request #311 · basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
