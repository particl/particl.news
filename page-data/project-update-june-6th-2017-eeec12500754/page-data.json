updated the exchange portal on particl.io since you last logged in.\nIn anticipation of Mainnet launch we need to prepare your account, each\ncontributor will be greeted with a page containing 4 sections:\n\n 1. Donate to a Good Cause. (community initiative #1)\n 2. Public Key Generation. (offline wallet generator)\n 3. Accept Terms.\n 4. I’m Ready. (submit)\n\n> To help everyone work through these steps we’ve created 2 guides; a video\nwalk-thru of the offline wallet generator and a written guide below.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVideo Tutorial link: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSjLsCkabEk&feature=youtu.be\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSjLsCkabEk&feature=youtu.be]\n\nGetting Started:\n * Login to your account on the Particl Token Exchange site: https://particl.io\n\n * Open a new tab in your browser and navigate to: \n   https://particl.github.io/genesis-wallet-generator/bip39-standalone.html\n * You can choose to run this Genesis Wallet Generation procedure either on\n\n 1. Local Computer or\n 2. Offline (via livecd/airgapped computer)\n\nLocal Computer\n * In your browser, select File → Save As… and save this page on your local\n   computer.\n * Double-click that file to open it in a browser\n\nOffline (LIVECD/AIRGAPPED) — Recommended!\n * In your browser, select File → Save As… and save this page on a USB stick.\n * Boot your preferred LIVECD / AIRGAPPED setup with Networking DISABLED\n * Insert USB and double-click the downloaded file to open it in a browser\n\n> NOTE: If you are using Offline method during Steps 3 and 4 below copy the\ninformation into a new text file on the USB Stick. You can then swap the USB\nStick back to your computer running Particl Dashboard and copy + paste the\nrelevant information into the Particl Dashboard.\nNow you’re in the Particl — Offline Genesis Wallet Generator Tool and ready for\nthe next steps!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Generate Wallet Recovery Phrase\n * Click on the GENERATE button to generate your mnemonic recovery phrase OR you\n   can alternatively enter an existing mnemonic recovery phrase that you have\n   already generated. More words will provide greater security\n\n> Typing your own words will probably not work how you expect, since the words\nrequire a particular structure (the last word is a checksum).\nThis recovery phrase is the key to your wallet, similar to the key to your home\nor car. Be sure to write these down, copy it and store them somewhere safe. \nWithout it, you will not be able to access your wallet. Do not share these with\nanyone.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. Securing Your Wallet\n * This step is optional but recommended. If you enter a passphrase here be sure\n   to write it down, copy it and store it somewhere safe. Without it, you will\n   not be able to access your wallet. Do not share these with anyone.\n * If you setup a passphrase here you will require both “RECOVERY PHRASE” from\n   Step 1 AND “PASSPHRASE” from Step 2 to access your wallet at launch.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3. Your Public Key\n * Copy this text and go back to the open tab within your Particl Dashboard.\n * Paste this text into YOUR PUBLIC KEY field.\n\n> You do not need to store this information once you have entered it into the\nParticl Portal\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4. Your Address\n * Navigate back to the tab with the Particl — Offline Genesis Wallet Generator\n   open\n * Copy this text and return to the Particl Portal\n * Paste this text into FIRST ADDRESS field\n\n> You do not need to store this information once you have entered it into the\nParticl Portal\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlmost Done\nYou’re now a proud owner of:\n\n * a brand new Particl Wallet ready to receive your Particl tokens\n * a Public Key that will be used to send your Particl tokens to\n * a Recovery Phrase so that you can access your new Wallet (once the main net\n   is live) and in the future in case you need to restore access to your Wallet\n * and ideally a Passphrase to secure your Recovery Phrase\n\n> If you forgot something, now is a good time to go back and save all the\nimportant information. If you think you made a mistake somewhere, don’t\nworry — you can start over as many times as you want.\nPlease remember to safely write down or print:\n * the Recovery Phrase\n * the optional Passphrase\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nComplete the final step\nBe sure to complete the remaining Section #3 and Section #4 in the portal. \nPlease take the time to read and understand the Terms and double-check all your\ninformation before clicking the “SUBMIT” button.\n\n> In case you need some help, our Particl Team and Community will be glad to help!\nCome and join us on Reddit [https://reddit.com/r/particl], Slack\n[https://particl.slack.com/] (get invite here [http://slack.particl.io/]) or \nRiot [https://riot.im/app/#/room/#particl:matrix.org].","html":"<h3 id=\"we-ve-updated-the-exchange-portal-on-particl-io-since-you-last-logged-in-\">We’ve updated the exchange portal on particl.io since you last logged in.</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Guide--How-to-Generate-your-Particl-Wallet/0-VGrKdEVXQBWyh6MH.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>In anticipation of Mainnet launch we need to prepare your account, each contributor will be greeted with a page containing 4 sections:</p><ol><li>Donate to a Good Cause.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
