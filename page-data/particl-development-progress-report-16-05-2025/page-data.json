Rather than a setback,\nthis represents valuable R&D progress that has clarified how to address the\nspecific issues we faced.\n\nFollowing this hurdle, we've been able to make much faster progress and are\npleased to announce that automated tests using Simplex as an alternative\nmessaging network for relaying swap and offer data now pass successfully. This\nmarks a significant milestone in the development of multi-net functionality and\nbrings us much closer to merging this feature into the dev branch for mainnet\nimplementation.\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nWe've also made excellent progress this week integrating the automated market\nmaking script into the user interface. While some work and testing remain, this\nnew functionality is nearly ready to be merged into the dev branch as well.\n\nThe new BasicSwap page connects directly with the automated market making\ncompanion script, allowing you to interact with it directly from the user\ninterface. This means you can deploy it, edit its configuration, and post offers\nusing advanced trading options—such as automatic republishing, automatic fiat\nspread adjustment, price pegging, and more—straight from the user interface.\n\nNote that while this page will likely be released soon, the script remains\nexperimental. After sufficient community testing, we plan to integrate some of\nits advanced order management capabilities directly into the standard flow for\nposting new offers. This will radically improve the user experience for market\nmakers on BasicSwap, making the platform much more accessible to a wider\naudience.\n\nGeneral Updates and Maintenance ⚙️\nIn addition to the major items mentioned above, we plan to investigate and\nimplement a wide variety of general improvements, tweaks, and bug fixes over the\nnext few weeks.\n\nDr. Kap at the Litecoin Summit in May ?️\nDr. Kap will be representing Particl and BasicSwap DEX at this year's edition of\nthe Litecoin Summit on the 29th and 30th of May, 2025\n[https://litecoin.com/summit-2025].\n\nOn the 29th, he'll give a presentation on BasicSwap DEX which will delve into\nour current short-to-medium term objective of making atomic swaps more\naccessible and intuitive for everyone to use and how we intend to leverage\nBasicSwap's current and upcoming pioneering technology to further the level of\ndecentralization in crypto and eCommerce by reducing reliance on central\nparties.\n\nOn the next day, he will participate on a panel focused on privacy with other\ngreat speakers and figures from the scene, including SethForPrivacy (Cake\nWallet), Justin Berman (Monero dev), Joël Valenzuela (Dash), and Paul Puey\n(Edge).\n\n * More information: https://litecoin.com/summit-2025\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nMulti-Net Support ?\nThe integration of Simplex as the first alternative to SMSG using the platform's\nnew multi-net capability is now mostly complete. We're currently focused on\ntesting the integration and implementing quality-of-life improvements and code\nclean-up.\n\nWe're targeting a full release of this new capability for late May or early June\n2025.\n\nFollowing this release, our backend development will shift toward implementing\nseveral minor improvements and fixes, after which we'll begin work on SPV\nwallets and offline signing functionality.\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nEarlier this week, we submitted a pull request for the alpha version of the\nautomated market making tool integration into BasicSwap. While it hasn't been\nmerged into the dev branch yet, eager users can test it by pulling the PR into\ntheir local BasicSwap instance.\n\nFollowing preliminary testing and feedback from contributors, we've already\nimplemented numerous improvements to the pull request since its initial\npublication. The changelog includes:\n\n * Added full functional AMM web GUI in BSX,\n * Added adjust_rates_based_on_market, which adjust rates based on existing\n   market offers,\n * The control host/port is now queried from the basicswap.json and only shown\n   under debug_ui,\n * The Files section is only visible when debug is enabled,\n * The AMM Logs section is only visible when debug_ui is enabled,\n * The buffering warning is fixed when starting the AMM process,\n * Moved the following settings to only be visible when debug_ui is enabled: Min\n   Seconds Between Bids, Max Seconds Between Bids, Prune State Delay (seconds),\n   and Prune State After (seconds),\n * Bug where editing an offer or bid always shows \"Particl Particl\" instead of\n   the correct coin_from and coin_to values from the table,\n * Removed auto_accept_offers for bids,\n * Removed auto_accept_bids from the GUI (already the default behavior),\n * Made Adjust Rates Based on Market Per-Offer,\n * Removed the global adjust_rates_based_on_market setting,\n * Added adjust_rates_based_on_market checkbox to the offer form (both add and\n   edit)\n * Added a note that it respects the rate tweak percent,\n * Updated the FAQ Section,\n * Updated the default JSON,\n * All fields from the default JSON configuration are now available in the UI,\n * The amount_variable field is always set to true by default and not exposed in\n   the UI,\n * The swap_type, min_swap_amount, and amount_step fields are properly handled,\n * Updated swap_type with drop-down (Adaptor Sig, Secret Hash) based on what\n   coins you select,\n * Fixed the PART/PART_ANON/PART_BLIND rate lookup issue. Also using the coin\n   ID's and not the names,\n * Added get rate lookup button @ min rate,\n * Renamed and set \"active\" column hidden,\n * Offer valid seconds, use min val of 600,\n * Moved all related bids functions for now under debug,\n * Fixed small typo in unlock page,\n * Fixed decimal separator issue in modals,\n * Added option to prune/clear the state file,\n * Fixes small bug in header page,\n * AMM when debug (on) smaller logs / spam,\n * Fixed linting, code formatting, and additional clean up.\n\nThe AMM tool is nearly ready to be merged into the dev branch for broader\ncommunity testing, so watch for an announcement blog post on this development\nsoon!\n\nDr. Kap at the Litecoin Summit in May ?️\nDr. Kap will be representing Particl and BasicSwap DEX at this year's edition of\nthe Litecoin Summit on the 29th and 30th of May, 2025\n[https://litecoin.com/summit-2025].\n\nOn the 29th, he'll give a presentation on BasicSwap DEX which will delve into\nour current short-to-medium term objective of making atomic swaps more\naccessible and intuitive for everyone to use and how we intend to leverage\nBasicSwap's current and upcoming pioneering technology to further the level of\ndecentralization in crypto and eCommerce by reducing reliance on central\nparties.\n\nOn the next day, he will participate on a panel focused on privacy with other\ngreat speakers and figures from the scene, including SethForPrivacy (Cake\nWallet), Justin Berman (Monero dev), Joël Valenzuela (Dash), and Paul Puey\n(Edge).\n\n * More information: https://litecoin.com/summit-2025\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

BasicSwap Bug FixesThere is a new mandatory Firo\ncore update on BasicSwap DEX.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/mandatory-firo-core-update-may2025/]Earlier this week, we\nreleased a new BasicSwap update that includes various improvements and bug\nfixes. This update is mandatory for users who trade Firo on the platform, as it\nenables you to easily update your Firo core in preparation for their upcoming\nhardfork scheduled for approximately May 28, 2025.\n\nPlease note that updating BasicSwap is only the first step in preparing for the\nhardfork; you must also update your Firo core after completing the BasicSwap\nupdate.\n\nFor the complete changelog and detailed instructions on how to properly update\nyour Firo node, please visit the release blog post here: \nhttps://particl.news/mandatory-firo-core-update-may2025/\n\nBasicSwap Progress ⚙️\nWe've pushed, to the dev branch, a commit that checks for the minimum sqlite\ndatabase version\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/7df2f1b29080e4c95fe36d173551c57c7abd5e50] \nand also have a pull request ready for merge\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/307], which includes the following\nchanges:\n\n * Price tiles to display accurate BTC/satoshi per-coin conversion,\n * Resolved volume display issue for BCH and Firo currencies,\n * Upgrade and fix memory-manager, tooltip-manager, and cleanup-manager\n   JavaScript modules,\n * Memory: Eliminated redundant console.log() statements across multiple pages,\n   preventing log accumulation on network offers page when developer tools are\n   active,\n * Add a new \"All Bids\" tab and table in the Bids page,\n * Improved header navigation: clicking on bids now directs to the ALL tab, with\n   bid counters properly routing to sent/received tabs,\n * Export function of the Bids page now exports \"All Bids\",\n * Minor fixes to .csv bids export function,\n * Various minor GUI fixes and optimizations.\n\nOn top of these minor commits, we've continued our work on the previously\nmentioned major deliverables for this current development cycle:\n\nMulti-Net Support ?\nWhile we've implemented a significant portion of what's required to provide\nBasicSwap with multi-net support (the ability for BasicSwap to relay data\nmessages such as offers, swap data, or identities using networks other than\nSMSG), this new functionality is not yet fully operational.\n\nWe're continuing development in this area and expect to complete a proof of\nconcept using Simplex as the first integrated network relatively soon. As a\nreminder, this implementation standardizes messages and encrypts them using\nSMSG's methodology, allowing almost any data or messaging network to relay\nBasicSwap messages such as Telegram, IRC, Torrent/P2P networks, and others. As a\nsignificant plus, all messages are encrypted before broadcast, meaning that this\napproach presents minimal privacy compromises.\n\nLight Wallets ?\nAfter completing multi-net support, our next focus will likely be implementing\nsupport for light wallets or remote nodes for most coins available on BasicSwap.\nThis will allow you to set up BasicSwap without syncing a full node or storing\nthe entire blockchain on your device, significantly improving setup time and\nconvenience.\n\nNote that this feature will be offered as an option, allowing you to still set\nup the DEX using full nodes for maximum security and privacy if preferred.\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nIntegrating the current market making tools into BasicSwap's GUI is now this\nmonth's main front-end focus. While we intended to make more progress on it last\nmonth, a lot of time was spent refactoring the UI's back-end code which will pay\noff in the long-term and make BasicSwap better structured and easier for\ncontributors to jump in.\n\nAdvanced Order Book Display ?\nAnother area we plan to advance during the next development cycle is the\naddition of advanced data visualization in the order book, notably depth charts\nfor each trading pair and split order book displaying buy and sell offers on\nseparate sides\n\nThese improvements will bring BasicSwap's order book experience closer to what\nusers expect when interacting with centralized exchanges, bridging the gap\nbetween traditional platforms and decentralized trading—allowing users to enjoy\nconvenience benefits without the typical security trade-offs.\n\nGeneral Updates and Maintenance ⚙️\nIn addition to the major items mentioned above, we plan to investigate and\nimplement a wide variety of general improvements, tweaks, and bug fixes over the\nnext few weeks.\n\nDr. Kap at the Litecoin Summit in May ?️\nDr. Kap will be representing Particl and BasicSwap DEX at this year's edition of\nthe Litecoin Summit on the 29th and 30th of May, 2025\n[https://litecoin.com/summit-2025].\n\nOn the 29th, he'll give a presentation on BasicSwap DEX which will delve into\nour current short-to-medium term objective of making atomic swaps more\naccessible and intuitive for everyone to use and how we intend to leverage\nBasicSwap's current and upcoming pioneering technology to further the level of\ndecentralization in crypto and eCommerce by reducing reliance on central\nparties.\n\nOn the next day, he will participate on a panel focused on privacy with other\ngreat speakers and figures from the scene, including SethForPrivacy (Cake\nWallet), Justin Berman (Monero dev), Joël Valenzuela (Dash), and Paul Puey\n(Edge).\n\n * More information: https://litecoin.com/summit-2025\n\nPART in MEXC Assessment Zone ⚠️\nA few days ago, MEXC placed the PART trading pair in its Assessment Zone due to\nlow order book liquidity and insufficient total value of PART coins deposited on\nthe platform.\n\nWhile this does not constitute a formal delisting yet, the exchange has\ncommunicated that the community must increase both liquidity and the total\nnumber of PART coins held on the exchange to maintain the listing.\n\nTherefore, we invite community members who wish to preserve PART's presence on\nMEXC to consider contributing to order book liquidity and depositing some of\ntheir coins on the exchange.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
