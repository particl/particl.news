The team has been\nworking on some exciting stuff that is yet to be announced. Stay tuned as more\nwill be revealed during the Particl World Tour.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop\nParticl Desktop is the network’s flagship client and the most user-friendly way\nto use the available features and Dapps offered by Particl such as the Open\nMarketplace, for example.\n\nGlobal Wallet Settings\nRead more: Particl Desktop Settings\n[https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b#c8cb]\nThe lowest hanging fruit for improving Particl's user experience is by making\nseveral tweaks to the user interface of…\n[https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b#c8cb]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b#c8cb]\n\nThe upcoming Settings feature of Particl Desktop is pretty much\nself-explanatory — it allows you to manage your settings and preferences right\nfrom Particl Desktop and without having to modify configuration files.\n\nWhat’s not yet common knowledge, though, is that the settings and preferences\nwill be separated into two categories. The first category, Global Settings, are\nclient-wide settings that regulate the entire Particl Desktop client. These\nsettings are effective for all wallets and contain options like enable UPnP,\nconnect clients via proxy, or choose the client’s language (for those who prefer\ntheir client not to display text in English).\n\nThe second type of settings, Wallet Settings, are parameters that are effective\nonly within the specific wallet on which they have been set up. What it means is\nthat when changing preferences within the Wallet Settings page, the changes only\napply to the wallet you’re currently in. Changes will not affect other wallets\nand each one can have its independent parameters. An example of wallet-specific\nsettings would be Notifications Settings, where you can specify what you want to\nbe notified of (payment received, pending orders, staking rewards, new\nproposals, etc).\n\nAs it stands today, all the technical changes that were required for the Global\nSettings are now completed. The team is now busy with tweaking the GUI/front-end\nto display the new changes correctly and to easily allow for the updating of\nthese parameters as well as the addition of new options, in the future.\n\nOpen Marketplace\nThe Open Marketplace is Particl’s first official Dapp. It is a decentralized and\nprivate-by-default marketplace where anyone can buy and sell stuff for crypto at\nnear-zero cost and without leaving a trace.\n\nMarket Management\nRead More: Market Management Tool\n[https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b#7168]\nThe lowest hanging fruit for improving Particl's user experience is by making\nseveral tweaks to the user interface of…\n[https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b#7168]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b#7168]\n\nMarket Management is the Open Marketplace’s tool which allows anyone to create a\nshop or a personal market. This is a key component for the Open Marketplace and\nwill be a cornerstone for its adoption as it will allow more customization and\ntools for sellers (i.e. promoting listings, shops, or markets).\n\nAt this moment, the development team is working on the creation and integration\nof seller profiles. Seller profiles are a major addition coming along with\nMarket Management. They allow users to create “profiles” for each wallet. Each\nprofile has its very own “identity” and the client will offer a lot of options\nto manage profiles (i.e. a profile can be manually selected, per wallet, and can\nalso be associated with multiple markets at once). To better understand the\ndistinction between Markets, Profiles, and Identities, as introduced by the\nMarket Management tool, there’s no better explanation than the image below that\nwas put together by Juha Kovanen [https://github.com/xludx], Lead Open\nMarketplace Developer.\n\nA breakdown of Profiles, Markets, and IdentitiesAdditionally, because the Market\nManagement tool is such a big feature, and because it touches most of the Open\nMarketplace’s components, the team’s going through a significant marketplace\nrefactoring process so that the new changes can seamlessly be integrated.\n\nMystery Feature (Will be Revealed at SFBW)\nThe team has been quietly working on a secret feature which will be a major\ndriver to adoption. This feature will only be revealed on Friday the 1st of\nNovember at 11:30 am at SFBW’s Epicenter during Dr. Kapil Amarasinghe’s talk. Of\ncourse, it will be mentioned at the conferences, even before the speech, so if\nyou’re coming to SFBW or are in Vegas, you might get an exclusive scoop! This\nfeature will be a major driver to adoption for the Particl Open Marketplace and\nhas been a long-awaited addition.\n\nThe back-end code for this feature is now almost complete, with the front-end\nintegration beginning this week, if all goes well. Particl’s development team\nplans on starting the internal testing by the end of the week. While it’s likely\nthat the feature won’t be ready for release during SFBW, it will still be\nannounced regardless, even if that means that it will be released a short time\nafter the conference.\n\nOnce the feature is announced, a blog post will be published on Particl.news\nwith all the details!\n\nParticl Core\nParticl Core is the underlying blockchain protocol on which the Particl\necosystem runs.\n\nParticl’s Lightning Network\nParticl Lightning Network Now Available on Testnet\n[https://particl.news/particl-lightning-network-now-available-on-testnet-eb87a5ab65cd]\n⚡️First Testnet Particl LND Transaction Successful⚡️ Last week, Particl's Core\nDeveloper and Cryptographer, Tecnovert …\n[https://particl.news/particl-lightning-network-now-available-on-testnet-eb87a5ab65cd]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-lightning-network-now-available-on-testnet-eb87a5ab65cd]\n\nTo make sure the Particl network can handle as many transactions as possible,\nParticl’s Lead Core Developer and Cryptographer, Tecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert], has re-enabled Bitcoin-style Segwit scripts\ncompatibility with Particl Core and reverted Particl’s Lightning Network to a\nsimpler implementation that’s closer to Bitcoin’s. This will allow for a much\nsimpler implementation of Particl’s Lightning Network on mainnet and also make\nPART easier to integrate to PSBT hardware wallets\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0174.mediawiki].\n\nWhile it’s probably going to be some time until the Lightning Network is\nrequired for Particl to handle more transactions on its network (it’s estimated\nthat the Particl network can do about 70–80 public transactions per second),\nthis is a good pre-emptive measure to ensure that the protocol is ready as soon\nas it needs to be used.\n\nIt’s important to note that the Lightning Network can be used for more than just\nscaling a blockchain network. It can, for example, be used to facilitate and\nimprove the performance of atomic swaps or conduct swaps directly on LND,\nwithout even using atomic swaps. It is expected that LND will be used, in the\nfuture, to facilitate PART swaps.\n\nParticl Core 0.19.0.1 RC1 Pre-Released\nAlways with keeping with the latest Bitcoin Core development in mind, Particl\nCore 0.19.0.1 RC1\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1rc1] has been\npre-released on testnet and mainnet. While this isn’t particularly the biggest\nor most exciting update of Particl Core ever, it is important to keep these\nupdates coming as it makes sure Particl’s version doesn’t drift away from the\n“mother code”.\n\nIn reality, the longer you wait to update a Bitcoin-based codebase to Bitcoin’s\nlatest version, the more complicated and time-consuming it gets to update it\nlater. Additionally, it ensures that the chain benefits from all the same\nusability, performance, and security updates that Bitcoin gets.\n\nIf you feel like helping out, you can download Particl Core 0.19.0.1 RC1\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1rc1] today and\nreport any bug you find on Github, that is, if you find any, of course! As\nalways, it is recommended to hunt for bugs using testnet, not mainnet.\n\n> Download Particl Core 0.19.0.1 RC1 here: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1rc1\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Particl team is full steam ahead into the path to adoption for Particl and\nits Open Marketplace! With the most urgent items required to be integrated into\nParticl Desktop clearly laid down and planned out, the Open Marketplace is\ninching closer, every day, to reach the point where adoption can be made very\neasy.\n\nFor now, make sure you stay alert for when the Particl team will be in San\nFrancisco for SFBW’s Epicenter conference as the mystery feature will then be\nrevealed. That, too, will be a major driver to the adoption of the Open\nMarketplace!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Development-Update/1-G124MsOhBbu_p0gq7kj9-Q.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>As a portion of the Particl team is readying up for the <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-world-tour-2019-f6e3d3c7e09c\"><strong>Particl World Tour</strong></a>, the developers haven’t stopped a second tirelessly working on bringing some exciting features to <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core\"><strong>Particl Core</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/\"><strong>Particl Desktop</strong></a>, and the <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-market\"><strong>Open Marketplace</strong></a>.</p><p>As a reminder, the development team is currently focused on <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b\"><strong>eliminating as many barriers to adoption for its Open Marketplace</strong></a> as possible.

This “Particl World\nTour” series of conferences that’s coming within the next few days is when those\nsolutions will start being revealed. And the gears are already turning!\n\nThe announcements that are coming up for the project will likely change\nParticl’s game and kickstart the adoption of its network in significant ways.\nSome of the solutions being worked on at the moment are expected to be major\ndrivers for adoption and aim at bringing many transactions per day on the\nParticl blockchain.

Both Particl and this team has grown closer to each other ever\nsince meeting at Consensus 2019. Money20/20 is a fintech and financial\nconference uniting some of the biggest names in these industries. While it isn’t\na cryptocurrency or blockchain conference at all, it is a perfect opportunity\nfor the project to be introduced to various key players in the eCommerce and\nfinancial industry as well as get to know businesses and help them reduce their\noperational costs through the Particl platform.\n\nThe team that’s inviting Particl to this conference wishes to introduce the\nParticl protocol to many of its partners, clients, and friends. The objective\nbehind these meetings is to help these businesses to reduce their costs and\nincrease their security and privacy by using the Particl protocol in multiple\nways.\n\n> Note: Money20/20 is part of Las Vegas’ Blockchain Week, meaning many\nafter-parties and side-events will be happening throughout the week.

It’s the premier global event on the industry\ncalendar where C-Level Executives, renowned speakers, innovators and disruptors\nfrom across the world unite to drive change in the future of money. It’s a truly\nunique experience that facilitates the right conversations, enabling individuals\nand organizations of all sizes to achieve their goals and grow.Money20/20 is\nproud of the incredible growth they’ve experienced since the inaugural 2012\nevent, and they’re maintaining that momentum as the industry continues to\nconsolidate around on Money20/20.\n\nWorld Crypto & Blockchain Conference Vegas [https://worldcryptocon.com/] \n(October 25–31)\nVegas’ World CryptoCon (WCC), one of the major US-based blockchain conferences\nof the year and the main event of the Vegas Blockchain Week, is happening just a\nday after Particl’s presence at Money20/20. It’s also in the same city (Las\nVegas). The Particl team is going to seize this opportunity and have its team\nmembers that went to Money20/20 to continue their networking at WCC.\n\nSome of the companies and businesses present at Money20/20 are expected to also\nattend WCC, which will allow the team to continue some of the discussions\nstarted the day before and set follow-up meetings with different parties. It’ll\nbe a great opportunity to meet people that are also going to be at SFBW and get\nthem to pass by the Particl booth at SFBW’s Epicenter event and attend Dr. Kapil\nAmarasinghe’s (Josky/Kapoor) talk on Particl.\n\n> Note: WCC is part of Las Vegas’ Blockchain Week, meaning many after-parties and\nside-events will be happening throughout the week.

Executives, enthusiasts, and professionals\nfrom global enterprise companies, financial service providers, investment firms,\ntraders, advisory & auditing institutions, Blockchain focused startups, academic\ninstitutions, government policy advisors, and application developers will all\ndescend on Las Vegas to learn and network with you.WCC 2019 is 3 days of intense\ntraining & discussions, product demos, expert keynote addresses, panel\ndiscussions with top industry thought leaders and announcements from the best\nand brightest in the game…showcasing new products, ideas, and the best\ncommercially viable applications of Blockchain technology.\n\nSan Francisco Blockchain Week 2019 [https://www.sfblockchainweek.io/] (October\n28 to November 3)\nThe San Francisco Blockchain Week (SFBW) is one of the most important blockchain\nevents of 2019 and, for this reason, around 12 Particl representatives will be\npresent to attend. And if a lesson can be learned from previous conferences\nwhere Particl had a booth, there will be little to no rest time for any of these\nteam members. It’s no secret, San Francisco is the world’s biggest incubator of\ntech companies, and so this Blockchain Week is going to be attracting an\nimpressive number of people and companies looking for new and innovative\nblockchain opportunities to leverage.\n\nFor this year’s edition of SFBW’s Epicenter, Particl is going to be having a\nlarge booth for a duration of two days. The team is also going to give a talk\nits Open Marketplace and breakdown all of its benefits for individuals and\nbusinesses alike on the “Industry Stage” at 11:30 am on the 1st of November.\nDon’t miss this talk as it is expected to contain a few…crunchy insights and\ninformation. Fortunately, you shouldn’t worry too much about missing it if you\ncan’t make it to the conference as the full video of the talk will be published\nonline shortly after.\n\nNot only is the entire San Francisco Blockchain Week, with all of its events,\nside-events, and after-parties, the ideal opportunity to show Particl to all\nsorts of individuals (B2C and C2C users), but it’s also the perfect moment to\nget it in front of the right businesses that are hungry about leveraging new\ninnovations to optimize what they have to offer.\n\nFor more information, read this blog post published earlier this month on\nParticl’s blog: \nhttps://particl.news/particl-in-san-francisco-sfbw-2019-bdaf0426349a\n\nParticl in San Francisco - SFBW 2019\n[https://particl.news/particl-in-san-francisco-sfbw-2019-bdaf0426349a]\nParticl is excited to announce that 12 Particl representatives will be going to\nthe 2019 San Francisco Blockchain Week…\n[https://particl.news/particl-in-san-francisco-sfbw-2019-bdaf0426349a]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-in-san-francisco-sfbw-2019-bdaf0426349a]\n\n> Note: Epicenter is part of the San Francisco Blockchain Week (SFBW), meaning\nmany after-parties and side-events will be happening throughout the week.\nParticl will seek out the most logical and worthy events to attend to depending\non its needs and obligations at the time.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> San Francisco Blockchain Week [https://sfblockchainweek.io/partners] brings\ntogether blockchain startups, enterprise initiatives, academics, developers, and\ninvestors together in a single space.

Not only is this the intersection between the Asian and\nEuropean FinTech industries, but the country is also seeking to push new\nregulations that would eliminate any taxes for purchases and sales made using\ncryptocurrencies. This, combined with the Open Marketplace’s near-zero costs,\nwill create a huge opportunity for businesses, allowing them to dramatically\nreduce their costs in a way that simply wouldn’t be possible if using\ntraditional payment methods (as in…not using cryptocurrencies).\n\nOn top of that, Singaporeans and Singaporean businesses are known for being\nparticularly tech-savvy and at the forefront of innovations. The strong benefits\nof the Open Marketplace, combined with the new crypto-friendly tax regulations\nthat are being proposed within the country, make a very strong case for using\nParticl.\n\nFor this reason, the team is going to send Particl’s advisor Miguel Cuneta to\ntouch base with various Singapore-based businesses and demonstrate how they\ncould dramatically optimize their entire business models. While individuals\nstand to save a lot of money per sale selling on Particl, Miguel’s presence at\nthis conference will mostly be focused on reaching out to businesses.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> BlockShow Asia 2019 is one of the major international platforms for showcasing\ninnovative Blockchain solutions revealing hottest industry trends & sensations\nand bringing together Blockchain enthusiasts and experts from all over the world\n(powered by Cointelegraph).The conference will take place on November, 14–15 in\nSingapore, Marina Bay Sands Expo — the city that has earned the distinction as\none of the world’s top destinations for blockchain meetings.\n\nSlush Helsinki — Finland [https://www.slush.org/events/helsinki/] (November\n21–22)\nSlush is a world-renowned startup focused conference. Like Money20/20, it is not\na cryptocurrency or blockchain conference, but it’s an event designed to help\nand propel early startups by connecting them to strategic partners, advisors,\nand experts in various industries. In other words, the entire purpose of this\nconference is to guide new projects to the right path and provide them access to\nkey resources so that they can thrive.\n\nThis year, Particl is going to be participating in the Helsinki’s edition, in\nFinland, by having a booth and also by taking part in the Slush100 pitching\ncompetition (more information on Slush’s website).\n[https://www.slush.org/events/helsinki/#/concepts=&dayFilters=&industries=&sideEventId=&targetAudience=]\n\nWhat’s very interesting about Slush is the altruistic “help each other out”\nmindset behind the event, its partners, and its attendees. To maximize its\npresence at the event, Particl will be able to pre-schedule meetings with\nvarious businesses, advisors, investors, and more. This will tie in nicely with\nthe progress and new connections that Particl will have made during the Particl\nWorld Tour, especially those made at Money20/20.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> Slush brings together 25,000 tech enthusiasts ranging from investors and\nstartups to international media and executives from Fortune 500 companies.

The xmrswap protocol\nis based on the work of Joël Gugger (h4sh3d [https://github.com/h4sh3d]) from\nthe Monero community. You can read Joël’s extensive whitepaper by following \nthis\nlink\n[https://github.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap/blob/master/whitepaper/xmr-btc.pdf]\n.\n\nTo make a Monero to Particl (or the other way around) atomic swap on mainnet,\nyou’ll first need to find another peer that also wants to do a swap, agree on\nswap parameters (how many Coin A for how many Coin B), and then simply follow\nthese step-by-step instructions here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/demo.md].\n\n * Step-by-step guide on how to make a XMR — PART atomic swap\n   [https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/demo.md]\n\n> Note: xmrswap is a fully-functioning Proof-of-Concept for a protocol that allows\nswapping Monero to Particl without any third-party at all. It is only available\nin CLI (command-line interface) for the moment.Although the protocol is safe and\nhas been tested extensively, it should still be considered as experimental\nsoftware. Its usage is reserved for advanced users only and no immediate support\nwill be provided from the Particl team or Tecnovert.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s an Atomic Swap\nIf you’re unfamiliar with the term, an “atomic swap” is a special type of \ncross-chain exchange that allows two parties that don’t know each other to\nexchange a currency for another without involving a third-party like an exchange\nor escrow service provider. The process is entirely trustless, meaning that you\ndon’t need to trust the other party to know for certain you won’t get scammed.\nThe integrity of each swap is guaranteed by cryptography.\n\nIn the specific case of this blog post, the “atomic swap” refers to the process\nof safely exchanging Monero for Particl, or Particl for Monero, without the help\nof any third-party.\n\nMonero and Particl Atomic Swap Use Cases\nAlthough this Proof-of-Concept is still only available as a command-line tool\nand reserved for advanced users only, it sets the foundation for future and\ndeeper integrations into the Particl ecosystem. Here are just some of the\nuse-cases the xmrswap protocol enables.\n\nShop online using XMR\nMonero is the world’s most private cryptocurrency. Particl has the world’s most\nprivate marketplace. Both are unstoppable. Then why not combine them and get the\nworld’s most private, unstoppable eCommerce ecosystem?\n\nThe xmrswap protocol can be integrated in such a way that lets you easily swap\nXMR for PART to privately buy anything on the Particl Marketplace without\nleaving any digital footprint. This same integration can be applied to easily\ncash out marketplace sales revenue into Monero and get that extra privacy layer\nwhen leaving the Particl ecosystem.\n\nIncreases Particl’s resiliency\nAdding a more user-friendly interface that easily allows to swap Monero, and\nother cryptocurrencies, for Particl will also increase Particl’s resiliency and\nmake it unstoppable.\n\nThat’s because atomic swaps, other than simply being great tools for privacy,\nsecurity, decentralization, and freedom, also act as a solid fallback solution\nin case of exchange delisting, geographical bans, and other types of restrictive\nmeasures. It reduces the overall influence some third-parties may have over the\nnetwork and allows it to be accessible in perpetuity.\n\nPrivately acquire PART\nA deeper integration into Particl Desktop would allow you to privately acquire\nPART straight from the Particl wallet and without having to forfeit your data to\nanyone, including exchanges, ISPs, and etc.\n\nThis is a particularly strong use-case if you take your privacy seriously as it\nnot only protects your personal information when using the marketplace, but also\nbefore and after using it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Next?\nIntegration of the xmrswapprotocol into Particl Desktop is an entirely separate\ntask and requires other Particl developers other than just Tecnovert to get\ninvolved. As they are currently busy with the Particl V3 release as well as\nother tasks, it is currently not possible to estimate when it will be ready.\n\nThere is, however, some mock ups in the works of how an xmrswap integration may\nlook like in Particl Desktop. Here’s one!\n\nTake note that this mock up is purely a work-in-progress and would most\ndefinitely look a bit different when it’ll be ready for release. It does,\nhowever, gives a good visual representation of how it may look like.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis news announcement is only part of some more major announcements coming\nsoon. Yes, it’s been a long road to the launch of V3, but it’s given the time\nfor the Particl team to prepare very exciting stuff for the “after-V3” era.\n\nStay tuned, the best is yet to come!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Monero-and-Particl-Atomic-Swaps/1-lx6zvR-f6pN7G9RmKx9otw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"swap-part-and-xmr-on-mainnet-without-any-3rd-party-\">Swap PART and XMR on Mainnet Without Any 3rd Party ?</h3><p>As we head towards the long-awaited <a href=\"https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813\"><strong>Particl V3 release</strong></a>, the Particl developers have been wrapping up the last few pieces required for its launch.</p><p>Particl V3 is Particl’s biggest update to date and it introduces a brand new desktop application as well as greatly improved marketplace experience.
