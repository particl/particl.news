Most of the screenshots are not in their\nfinal version and will be tweaked/polished before going live.\nRecently Completed and Released Items\nParticl Desktop 2.3.4\nThe Particl team released Particl Desktop 2.3.4\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.4]. This update\nadded new coin icons for use with the current in-app swap engine implementation.\nThis kind of update won’t be required with the new swap engine implementation\ncoming for Particl Desktop V3.0.\n\nParticl Desktop 2.3.5\nParticl Desktop 2.3.5The Particl team released Particl Desktop 2.3.5\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.5]. This update\nprovides a new validation to ensure that the SMSG local address used in the\nmarketplace is still registered in core. This fixes the issue where some users\ncouldn’t decrypt SMSG messages addressed to them anymore, making it impossible\nto progress in escrow without manual commands being entered in the debug window.\n\nThis update also included a visual indicator in the menu bar of the ‘market’\nwallet notifying the user that bid messages (new orders, escrow progression,\netc) cannot be processed while the wallet is locked (clicking on the indicator\nprompts for the wallet to be unlocked).\n\nImproved Discord Tipbot\nParticl developer Ludx worked on an improved Discord tipbot built from scratch.\nThis improves on the previous bot’s performance and adds features such as user\nand pool accounts, user authorization, commands to check balances, deposit and\nwithdraw, tip, giveaway, and rain. The tipbot is currently enabled on Discord.\nJust join Particl’s server [http://discord.me/particl] and type %help to get\nstarted.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProgress Report\nSell Section Layout Update (In Progress)\nIn the previous update, we mentioned that we had to make changes around how in\nthe ‘sell’ section the publishing of listings to single and multiple markets\nneeded some modifications. A rework of the layout was done for us to make the\nflow on the GUI feel seamless, where the backend needed to distinguish between\nBase templates and Market specific templates. This ensures that one could edit a\nmarket template specific to a market and save the details to be posted at a\nlater stage. The implementation of the re-worked layout is in progress.\n\nPull to Push Websocket Connection (Complete)\nIn order to improve the performance of the new 3.0 desktop application, a\nwebsocket connection to the marketplace engine allows for the Particl Desktop to\nreceive various push event notifications rather than polling for updates every\nfew seconds.\n\nMarket User Dashboard Improvements (Mostly Complete)\nMarket User Dashboard Preview (WIP)The Overview page of the market module has been recently improved on, ensuring\nall wallet info is displayed correctly. As the Sell and Buy sections of the\ndesktop application are completed, their respected section will be added to the\nOverview page. These include information like Sell and Buy page filters, new\nquestions on listings, funds locked in escrow, and various visual badges\nindicated your attention is needed somewhere.\n\nLink Listings to User Identity Instead of User Profile (Complete)\nWhile working on the Cart and Checkout integration we did pick up an issue where\nthe listings displayed in the cart were being identified at the profile level\nand this needed to be changed to the Identity level.\n\nWith the Profile as listing identifier, listings added to the cart from all\nsubscribed markets across all Identities would be displayed. This would mean\nthat continuing with the checkout, a buyer would need to pay for all items and\nmultiple wallets would need to be unlocked at a single time. For example, if the\nbuyer is browsing with Identity “A”, we ideally would want to only display\nlistings linked to that identity’s markets. This has been successfully changed\nand completed.\n\nListing Browser (In Progress)\nListings are now being created and displayed correctly with the correct\nCategories and Markets linked to them. All filtering and processing around the\nlistings are working as expected. There is still some integration left to be\ndone as other components get completed.\n\nNew Shipping Profiles section (Complete)\nEdit Shipping Profiles Page Preview (WIP)A new Shipping Profiles section for the\nmanaging of shipping addresses outside of the cart/checkout process has been\nadded to the new desktop application. This item is now complete.\n\nRefactored Market Functionalities (Complete)\nMarket Browser Preview (WIP)A bunch of core market functionalities have been\nrefactored and successfully integrated into the new desktop application. This\nincludes the display of listings, the flagging and voting of listing items,\nadding items to the cart and the checkout process, the favoriting of items, and\nthe managing of shipping profiles. These have all been marked as complete.\n\nNew Updated Place Bid Modal (Complete)\nIn the Cart section of the desktop application, the Place Bid modal has been\nredesigned to provide more information to the user and fit with the updated look\nof Particl Desktop.\n\nBug Fixes and General Improvements (Constantly in progress)\nWallet Encryption Modal Preview (WIP)A significant number of bug fixes and improvements to functionalities across the\nGUI implementation of the marketplace has been made. This, of course, is an\nongoing process and is always something on which the Particl developers are\nworking on at every release.\n\nUser Interface and User Experience Improvements (Constantly in progress)\nNew Batch Listing Modal Preview (WIP)As development goes on, numerous changes are being made to the design and layout \nof the desktop application to ensure the user has the best possible flow and\ninteraction within the GUI. This is an ongoing process and is always being\nworked on at every release.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNew Changes to the Market Codebase\nSince the last Development Update, a lot of changes have been successfully\nimplemented into the new market codebase (the underlying “backend” code of the\nmarketplace).\n\nHere’s a detailed list of all the recent changes:\n\n * Changes in ListingItemTemplates with market specific ListingItemTemplate and\n   versioning support.\n * Added additional validations for all marketplace messages.\n * All search commands refactored, added more validations.\n * Changes in ListingItemAdd/Vote message signing.\n * ShoppingCart linked to Identity rather than Profile.\n * Identity Vote calculations fixed.\n * Added push notifications for new Proposals.\n * Market specific ItemCategory support.\n * Market specific Proposals.\n * Bug fixes related to ListingItem/Image message separation.\n * Added Default Market and Profile commands.\n * OMP Library changes/bug fixes.\n * Smaller and larger API changes in ~45 of ~115 RPC commands.\n * Fixed some issues running the market with node v12.\n * Fixed/changed/added around 900 automated and integration test cases.\n * A number of changes all around as a result of the test case results.\n * Marketplace 0.2.10 bugfix release.\n\n> Note: Automating the build/upload into a more regular process is planned to be\nlooked into again soon after the v3.0 release.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDirect Buyer/Seller Communications Coming to V3.0\nA new and highly anticipated functionality is making its way onto Particl\nDesktop 3.0 — buyer and seller communications.\n\nNew Buyer/Seller Communications Section Preview (WIP)Whether you are a seller or\na buyer, this major improvement to the Question and Answer feature will let you\ncommunicate with the party you’re transacting with in case there is a need for\nit. It uses the same system as the Question and Answer section and is integrated\ndirectly as part of the escrow process.\n\nCommunication is vital for any mistake or issue to be resolved. But it also\nopens up the door to fraud, blackmail, and scam. For this reason, all messages\nsent between the two parties are publicly recorded directly in the Question and\nAnswer section. The system is directly linked to the user market dashboard and\nnotifies you whenever you receive a question or answer.\n\n> Note: This communication module is different than the encrypted instant\nmessaging app being worked on by DeMarkets.io. Keep reading for more details on\nit.\nThis completely transparent solution is to keep both parties in check and ensure\nthat they do not use this communications module to blackmail or threaten the\nother party which would then weaken the game-theory behind Particl’s two-party\nescrow system. Of course, it doesn’t prevent two users from exchanging contact\ninformation (i.e. sharing their Particl chat keys with each other or using a\nthird-party messaging app like Telegram), but it provides a great level of\ntransparency that can be used for vendors to build a reputation for themselves.\nBut more importantly than anything, it simply provides the ability for two\ntransacting users to touch base and resolve issues.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdates From DeMarkets.io\nDeMarkets.ioOver the last few weeks, the DeMarkets.io [http://DeMarkets.io] developers have\nbeen quite active. If you don’t know about DeMarkets.io already, a web browser\nfor decentralized marketplaces with additional features to come and have been\ncontributing to the Particl project for the last several months. Their website\ncurrently displays Particl Marketplace statistics and provides a listing browser\nthat lets you see marketplace listings from the web, without having to download\nParticl Desktop.\n\nDeMarkets.io has recently been working on two items that will be major\ncontributors to the Particl ecosystem. Here’s an update on each of them.\n\nNew DeMarkets.io Website\nThe DeMarkets team has been working on a major update to its website that\nchanges most of it. This update is planned to be released shortly and adds the\nability to view and share individual listings. It also lets you create shops on\nthe website so that you can aggregate and easily showcase your listings as a\nvendor. DeMarkets estimates the update will go live within the next 1 to 2 weeks\n.\n\nEncrypted Instant Messaging App (Particl Desktop)\nTheir team has also been working on an encrypted instant messaging application\nthat will be integrated as a new Particl Desktop module. The app is powered by\nSMSG and lets users safely communicate without worrying about any third-party\nbeing able to intercept and read messages.\n\nThe encrypted instant messaging app is still under development and has taken a\nsecond priority, behind the release of DeMarkets.io’s new website. It is\ncurrently scheduled to go live shortly after Particl V3.0.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt’s All Coming Together Nicely\nAs you can see, the Particl developers have been putting the pedal to the metal\nfor the last few weeks so that they can complete the remaining items required\nfor launching Particl V3.0 as fast as possible.\n\nThe great majority of the core components required for it to be ready are now\ncomplete or are well on their way to being ready. This leaves fewer and fewer\nitems left to integrate into the new desktop application and brings us closer to\nthe release every day.\n\nKeep in mind, Particl V3.0 is Particl’s biggest update to date. It not only\nsignificantly changes the marketplace codebase but also the desktop application\nas a whole. For this reason, this particular update has taken much longer to be\nready than other past releases, but the difference in user experience will\nabsolutely speak for itself.\n\nParticl V3 is going to be much faster, lightweight, easier to use, and\nfeature-complete than it has ever been.","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Development-Update--10-08-2020-/1-sHXTBG2Awq9mmhexu0LdzA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"particl-v3-0-updates-and-more\">Particl V3.0 Updates and More</h3><p>In the past few weeks, the development of Particl V3.0 has been going particularly smoothly which has allowed the Particl developers to make a lot of progress on every front.</p><p>Here is the latest development progress report from Particl’s Development Manager Henk Swardt.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> All screenshots included in this update are work-in-progress and subject to change before the mainnet release.

This update provides a new validation to ensure that the SMSG local address used in the marketplace is still registered in core. This fixes the issue where some users couldn’t decrypt SMSG messages addressed to them anymore, making it impossible to progress in escrow without manual commands being entered in the debug window.</p><p>This update also included a visual indicator in the menu bar of the ‘market’ wallet notifying the user that bid messages (new orders, escrow progression, etc) cannot be processed while the wallet is locked (clicking on the indicator prompts for the wallet to be unlocked).</p><h3 id=\"improved-discord-tipbot\">Improved Discord Tipbot</h3><p>Particl developer Ludx worked on an improved Discord tipbot built from scratch. This improves on the previous bot’s performance and adds features such as user and pool accounts, user authorization, commands to check balances, deposit and withdraw, tip, giveaway, and rain. The tipbot is currently enabled on Discord. Just join <a href=\"http://discord.me/particl\"><strong>Particl’s server</strong></a> and type %help to get started.</p><hr><h2 id=\"progress-report\">Progress Report</h2><h3 id=\"sell-section-layout-update-in-progress-\">Sell Section Layout Update (In Progress)</h3><p>In the previous update, we mentioned that we had to make changes around how in the ‘sell’ section the publishing of listings to single and multiple markets needed some modifications. A rework of the layout was done for us to make the flow on the GUI feel seamless, where the backend needed to distinguish between Base templates and Market specific templates. This ensures that one could edit a market template specific to a market and save the details to be posted at a later stage. The implementation of the re-worked layout is in progress.</p><h3 id=\"pull-to-push-websocket-connection-complete-\">Pull to Push Websocket Connection (Complete)</h3><p>In order to improve the performance of the new 3.0 desktop application, a websocket connection to the marketplace engine allows for the Particl Desktop to receive various push event notifications rather than polling for updates every few seconds.</p><h3 id=\"market-user-dashboard-improvements-mostly-complete-\">Market User Dashboard Improvements (Mostly Complete)</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Development-Update--10-08-2020-/1-QXCxonxyXy9kQzg7HQS_1g.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Market User Dashboard Preview (WIP)</figcaption></figure><p>The <strong>Overview page of the market module has been recently improved on</strong>, ensuring all wallet info is displayed correctly. As the Sell and Buy sections of the desktop application are completed, their respected section will be added to the Overview page. These include information like Sell and Buy page filters, new questions on listings, funds locked in escrow, and various visual badges indicated your attention is needed somewhere.</p><h3 id=\"link-listings-to-user-identity-instead-of-user-profile-complete-\">Link Listings to User Identity Instead of User Profile (Complete)</h3><p>While working on the Cart and Checkout integration we did pick up an issue where the listings displayed in the cart were being identified at the profile level and this needed to be changed to the Identity level.</p><p>With the Profile as listing identifier, listings added to the cart from all subscribed markets across all Identities would be displayed. This would mean that continuing with the checkout, a buyer would need to pay for all items and multiple wallets would need to be unlocked at a single time. For example, if the buyer is browsing with Identity “A”, we ideally would want to only display listings linked to that identity’s markets. <strong>This has been successfully changed and completed.</strong></p><h3 id=\"listing-browser-in-progress-\">Listing Browser (In Progress)</h3><p>Listings are now being created and displayed correctly with the correct Categories and Markets linked to them.

It uses the same system as the Question and Answer section and is integrated directly as part of the escrow process.</p><p>Communication is vital for any mistake or issue to be resolved. But it also opens up the door to fraud, blackmail, and scam. For this reason, all messages sent between the two parties are publicly recorded directly in the Question and Answer section. The system is directly linked to the user market dashboard and notifies you whenever you receive a question or answer.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> This communication module is different than the encrypted instant messaging app being worked on by DeMarkets.io. Keep reading for more details on it.</blockquote><p>This completely transparent solution is to keep both parties in check and ensure that they do not use this communications module to blackmail or threaten the other party which would then weaken the game-theory behind Particl’s two-party escrow system. Of course, it doesn’t prevent two users from exchanging contact information (i.e. sharing their Particl chat keys with each other or using a third-party messaging app like Telegram), but <strong>it provides a great level of transparency that can be used for vendors to build a reputation for themselves</strong>. But more importantly than anything, it simply provides the ability for two transacting users to touch base and resolve issues.</p><hr><h2 id=\"updates-from-demarkets-io\">Updates From DeMarkets.io</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Development-Update--10-08-2020-/1-tVYCToZmqa0ead7Geqe41A.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>DeMarkets.io</figcaption></figure><p>Over the last few weeks, the <a href=\"http://DeMarkets.io\"><strong>DeMarkets.io</strong></a> developers have been quite active. If you don’t know about DeMarkets.io already, a web browser for decentralized marketplaces with additional features to come and have been contributing to the Particl project for the last several months. Their website currently displays Particl Marketplace statistics and provides a listing browser that lets you see marketplace listings from the web, without having to download Particl Desktop.</p><p>DeMarkets.io has recently been working on two items that will be major contributors to the Particl ecosystem. Here’s an update on each of them.</p><h3 id=\"new-demarkets-io-website\">New DeMarkets.io Website</h3><p>The DeMarkets team has been working on a major update to its website that changes most of it. This update is planned to be released shortly and <strong>adds the ability to view and share individual listings</strong>. It also lets you <strong>create shops on the website </strong>so that you can aggregate and easily showcase your listings as a vendor. DeMarkets estimates the update will go live within the next<strong> 1 to 2 weeks</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"encrypted-instant-messaging-app-particl-desktop-\">Encrypted Instant Messaging App (Particl Desktop)</h3><p>Their team has also been working on an encrypted instant messaging application that will be integrated as a new Particl Desktop module. The app is powered by SMSG and lets users safely communicate without worrying about any third-party being able to intercept and read messages.</p><p>The encrypted instant messaging app is still under development and has taken a second priority, behind the release of DeMarkets.io’s new website. It is currently <strong>scheduled to go live shortly after Particl V3.0.</strong></p><hr><h2 id=\"it-s-all-coming-together-nicely\">It’s All Coming Together Nicely</h2><p>As you can see, the Particl developers have been putting the pedal to the metal for the last few weeks so that they can complete the remaining items required for launching Particl V3.0 as fast as possible.</p><p>The great majority of the core components required for it to be ready are now complete or are well on their way to being ready. This leaves fewer and fewer items left to integrate into the new desktop application and brings us closer to the release every day.</p><p>Keep in mind, <strong>Particl V3.0 is Particl’s biggest update to date</strong>. It not only significantly changes the marketplace codebase but also the desktop application as a whole. For this reason, this particular update has taken much longer to be ready than other past releases, but the difference in user experience will absolutely speak for itself.</p><p>Particl V3 is going to be much faster, lightweight, easier to use, and feature-complete than it has ever been.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Development-Update--10-08-2020-/1-PKL5OeedHxpyFNSPt7X2-A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":["kg-card","kg-image-card","kg-width-wide"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"/glink/downloaded_images/Development-Update--10-08-2020-/1-sHXTBG2Awq9mmhexu0LdzA.jpeg","className":["kg-image"],"alt":""},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"particl-v3-0-updates-and-more"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Particl V3.0 Updates and More"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In the past few weeks, the development of Particl V3.0 has been going particularly smoothly which has allowed the Particl developers to make a lot of progress on every front."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Here is the latest development progress report from Particl’s Development Manager Henk Swardt."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"blockquote","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Note:"}]},{"type":"text","value":" All screenshots included in this update are work-in-progress and subject to change before the mainnet release.

Particl V3\nThe upcoming Particl V3.0 update is just about to take everything you know about\nParticl to the next level — it vastly improves the marketplace on all fronts,\nintroduces a brand new modular desktop application, enables multi-markets, and\nso much more! Check out the link below to know everything about the massive\nParticl V3.0 update.\n\nStepping Things Up Again With Particl Desktop 3.0\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\nA New Breakthrough for Privacy and eCommerce ?particl.news\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nImproved Swap Engine Coming on V3 Release\nOne of the main components that’s getting a big makeover with the Particl V3\nrelease is the in-app swap engine. This module, which is available right inside\nthe Particl Desktop application, lets you easily swap other cryptocurrencies for\nPART so that you can anonymously buy or sell anything on the marketplace. This\ncan be done, without ever leaving the Particl Desktop client, by using the\nstandalone swap module which is currently being powered by partners such as \nStealthEX [https://stealthex.io] and SimpleSwap [https://simpleswap.io/].\n\nImprovements Through Better Bot Management Support\nTo explain more precisely what improvements Particl V3 will bring to the swap\nengine, Particl developer Arnold Bansemer takes the time to elaborate on the\ntopic.\n\n“The biggest part of the in-app swap engine changes is better bot management.\nBots will increasingly drive traffic onto the network and will end up playing a\nnon-trivial role in getting some external functionality into the Particl\necosystem.\n\nWhat we’re aiming to do with the ongoing changes being made to the swap engine\nis to create a set of defined functionalities and requirements for how bot info\nis received and processed which will push towards a standardized way of creating\n“legitimate” bots.\n\nUsing these requirements, the bot manager in PD will then effectively act as a\n“processing plant” for bots. The bot manager UI in the desktop will provide the\nuser with a way to manage different bots (add/remove/view details/etc). Other\napps (i.e. the marketplace) wanting to use a bot of a certain type, or provide\nbot management for a particular bot type, will interact directly with the bot\nmanager to obtain those details.”\n\nMore Robust Framework\nParticl developer Arnold Bansemer continues: “The bot manager will help ensure\nthat only those bots meeting a particular standard set of functionality are\navailable. For example, in the case of Particl’s swap module, it would only\ninquire about EXCHANGE type of bots and display the relevant information based\non context.\n\nWhen receiving a message on the bot listener address, the bot manager probes the\nbot to find out its commands, and argument types, etc. Once this is known\n(assuming we get valid data back), Particl apps (i.e. the marketplace) can start\ndoing all sorts of things like show upgrade changes, allow apps to use specific\nversions of bots, receive specific requests or data, and etc.”\n\nList of Swap Engine Improvements\nIn addition to the back-end changes being made to the bot manager, a few\nadditional improvements and goodies are being added to the swap engine itself.\n\nThe main improvements it’s receiving with the V3 release are as follow:\n\n * More coins being made available to swap\n * Completely new user interface\n * More dynamic and responsive process\n * More built-in security measures\n * Aggregated display of available offers\n\nThe sum of all these changes makes Particl’s in-app swap engine as smooth to use\nas ever. A special mention is worth giving to whoever pushed a prediction market\nSMSG bot onto the network a few weeks ago, prompting the Particl team to develop\na more robust and efficient framework for community bot management and\ndeployment.\n\nNew Coins Getting Listed on V3 Release\nParticl’s in-app swap engine (WIP and subject to change before release)To\nsupport the mainnet launch of Particl V3 along with its improved in-app swap\nengine, new coins will be added and ready to swap on the day of the release.\n\n * Monero [https://www.getmonero.org/] (XMR)\n * DAI [https://makerdao.com/en/] (MakerDAO’s stablecoin)\n * NIX [https://nixplatform.io/] (Flare Wallet)\n * USDt [https://tether.to/] (Tether stablecoin)\n * USDC [https://www.centre.io/usdc] (Circle & Coinbase stablecoin)\n\nThese coins not only make Particl as accessible as before by extending the\nnumber of cryptocurrencies that can be used on the platform, but they also\nprovide new valuable functionalities by either adding an additional privacy\nlayer (i.e. Monero) to the mix or by allowing stablecoin payments to be made\n(i.e. DAI).\n\nKeep an Eye Out for More Coins to Come\nThis is only a beginning. Following the Particl V3 mainnet release, new coins\nwill start getting added more regularly to the improved in-app swap module. This\nwill create a cascading effect of added utility, network effect, as well as\nincrease the pool of potential marketplace shoppers and sellers.\n\nThis will create a perfect storm scenario — the combination of (1) all the new\ncoins getting added to Particl, (2) the improved in-app swapping experience, and\n(3) the major impact on the overall user experience caused by the V3 release\nwill make it as easy as ever to get new people to try on Particl.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIs there any coin you’d like to see added on Particl? Then let the Particl know\nby on the Discord server [https://discord.me/particl] or Telegram channel\n[https://t.me/particlproject]!

Along with Bitcoin, Zcoin has recently been added to Particl\nDesktop and will be followed shortly by MakerDAO’s DAI stablecoin.\n\nThis ability to add new coins to Particl has opened new doors and allowed\nParticl to work more closely with other blockchain projects. One such example is\nwith the Flare Wallet team.\n\nAs such, we are excited to announce that Flare Wallet has successfully\nintegrated cold staking for Particl on mobile and will be going live with the\nupdate somewhere next week. In exchange, Particl will be adding NIX to Particl\nDesktop V3.0, making it possible to easily swap NIX for PART to buy anything on\nthe Particl Marketplace without leaving any digital footprint behind.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Cold Staking on the Flare Wallet\nIn the next Flare Wallet update, you’ll be able to securely stake your PART\nusing their brand new integration of Particl’s cold staking protocol. You’ll be\nable to set it up by either connecting to a staking node or a staking pool\n[https://particl.wiki/learn/staking/pools#available-staking-pools]!\n\nThis update is scheduled for in a few days!\n\nWhat is Cold Staking?\nCold staking is, in simple terms, the ability to delegate the staking power of\nyour coins to an external staking node that contains no coin.

to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
