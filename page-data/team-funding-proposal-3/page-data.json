Since then, we’ve mainly\nworked on improving Particl Marketplace and Desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases] and getting BasicSwap\nready for its open beta launch\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commits/master].\n\nBasicSwap — The Fully Private Cross-Chain DEXMatch and settle cryptocurrency\ntrades in a trustless setup without any central point of failure or fee.Particl\nNewscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/]Here’s a\nbrief list of releases we’ve delivered since the start of the second funding\ncycle.\n\n * BasicSwap open beta launch (imminent\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/])\n * Successful Taproot hardfork (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/taproot-hardfork-successful/])\n * Particl Electrum release (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/particl-electrum-now-available/])\n * Six (6) Particl Desktop releases (check it out\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases])\n * Seven (7) Particl Core releases (check it out\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases])\n * Particl Core 23.x latest version (check it out\n   [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases])\n * Particl Marketplace messaging system (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-2-live-on-mainnet/])\n\nRoadmap Progress\nWe’ve also made steady progress on the completion of various development\nroadmap\nitems [https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/]. Here are the ones we’ve\ncompleted or made significant progress with during the past six months.\n\nMajor Milestones\nBasicSwap DEX We're now very close to releasing the long-anticipated open beta\nof BasicSwap, along with a user-friendly user interface. We've also massively\nimproved the DEX codebase, making it easier to use and faster to get started\nwith. \n\nAt the time of this writing, we are running a final round of tests on the\ncurrently available features and functions, as well as on the app's GUI. Once\nthat is completed and all potential issues are resolved, we will begin a final\nround of tests within our closed beta group, after which we will launch the open\nbeta. \n\nWeb framework We've made progress on the incremental deployment of an early web\nframework, notably by releasing the Particl.Store [https://www.particl.store] \ndemo. \n\nAlthough this may seem like a small step, this gateway uses a different and\nimproved marketplace codebase than Particl Desktop. It improves the coding\nefficiency and allows for greater compatibility with external access gateways —\na critical capability moving forward with Particl's next evolutionary phase. \n\nBlockchain and Coin\nConstant blockchain updates and improved zap functionality As usual, we've made\ncountless improvements to Particl Core, always keeping it up-to-date with the\nrecent versions of Bitcoin. As you can see here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master], this is no small task. \n\nNotably, we've improved its staking zap functionality by allowing for a more\ncustomizable process management. You can now choose between two zapping options;\noptimized for staking revenue or optimized for maximum privacy. \n\nParticl Electrum Back in March, we've released the Particl Electrum light wallet\n[https://particl.news/particl-electrum-now-available/]. It provides light\nblockchain services to the ecosystem on both desktop and mobile devices. \n\nParticl Electrum is expected to play a useful role in usability with the\necosystem's upcoming evolutionary phase, allowing dApps and services to connect\nto and use Particl Blockchain without having to sync it fully. \n\nTaproot Support On February 1st, the Particl Blockchain successfully hardforked to enable the\nTaproot protocol improvement [https://particl.news/taproot-hardfork-successful/]\n. Taproot is a major upgrade for Particl Blockchain, allowing for more complex\nsmart-contracts, cheaper transactions, and better privacy and scalability. \n\nMarketplace\nMessaging system During this funding cycle, the most significant feature update\nto Particl Marketplace has been the addition of a decentralized messaging system\nin which sellers, buyers, and potential buyers can discuss. \n\nThis is a critical functionality, especially when issues require to be resolved\nbefore both parties agree to finalize an escrowed marketplace transaction. \n\nProduct codes Product codes attach a unique ID to listing templates, allowing\nfor better inventory management and more efficient use of external platforms. \n\nThis feature update already embraces Particl's new modular approach by allowing\nindividual marketplace listings to interact with outside \"modules\" (i.e.,\nthird-party cross-platform inventory management system). \n\nA ton of general improvements Aside from the two feature updates mentioned\nabove, a large number of general additions, improvements, and bug fixes have\nbeen added to Particl Marketplace and the desktop application. Because there is\nway too much to mention here, we invite you to check out the full list of\nchanges available here [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/]. \n\nDesktop\nMultiple Particl Desktop improvements As part of the upcoming Particl Desktop\n3.3 release, we've begun incrementally separating Particl Core from Particl\nDesktop. \n\nAlthough it used to be a singular roadmap item at the time of the previous\nfunding cycle, this process has now become part of a wider ecosystem upgrade\nwhich we announced earlier this week here\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/]. \n\nMore user configurability We've been working, also as part of the upcoming\nParticl Desktop 3.3 release, on better client user configuration. This will give\nusers more options and control over their Particl experience. This improvement\nis partly related to the previous item regarding Core and Desktop separation and\nis a step forward in the context of Particl's upcoming new development cycle. \n\nMajor dependencies update and general improvements Throughout the second funding\ncycle, we've made a major dependencies update and applied a large number of code\nimprovements, bug fixes, and tweaks to the desktop client. You can see every\naddition to Particl Desktop by following this link\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/]. \n\nThe Announcement of Particl's Next Evolutionary Leap Forward\nOn the 2nd of August, 2022, we published the major announcement of Particl's\nnext evolutionary phase.\n\nParticl’s Next Evolutionary Leap ForwardLearn about the team’s new major\ndevelopment cycle and discover Particl’s upcoming open-source foundation for\nthe\ndevelopment and deployment of privacy-first dApps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/]The announced\ndevelopment cycle will be the biggest evolution of the Particl ecosystem since\nthe project's inception in 2017.

The failed block index is then added to m_failed_blocks — a record of\nfailed blocks maintained by the node — and remains in there even after the block\nindex is removed from the blockchain to prevent DoS issues.\n\nWhen the next valid block is staked, it is assigned the same block index as the\nremoved block index still in m_failed_blocks because the blockchain only\nverifies m_failed_blocks when blocks arrive out of order, not knowing this\nspecific block index is already in use.\n\nThus, after the node processes a group of blocks following an invalid block, it\ndetects a false positive in m_failed_blocks and refuses to follow the valid\nchain, instead spawning a new fork. As m_failed_blocks only exists in memory\nwhen the node restarts, the chain can sync past that fork.\n\nThis update fixes that issue by properly removing the block index from the \nm_failed_blocks.\n\nHow to Check if my Node was Impacted?\nThe best way to check if your node was impacted is to verify at what block it is\ncurrently staking. If your staking node's current block number matches that of \nParticl's explorer [https://explorer.particl.io], then your node hasn't been\nimpacted.\n\nIf it shows a different block number, then it is likely stuck to an odd fork and\nisn't staking on the right chain anymore. \n\nHow to Fix my Impacted Node(s)?\n * For individual stakers: Simply update your Particl Core version, restart your\n   node, and run the clearbanned command. \n * For staking pools: Update your Particl Core version, run a fresh syncing\n   process in observer mode, then switch to the master branch. \n\n> Note: In some rare cases, you may need to restart your node more than once until\nit syncs back to the correct chain. Running clearbanned should, however, cleanly\nget you back in sync without having to restart your node multiple times.\nWhat's the Impact of this Bug?\nThe impact of this bug would usually be relatively small, preventing affected\nstakers from receiving staking rewards until they get their nodes back in sync.\nUnfortunately, this time the issue happened during an on-chain voting period. \n\nAs a result, we expect this voting round's participation rate to be\nsignificantly lower than what we typically see in other votes because a number\nof large nodes and one staking pool were knocked off the network momentarily.\n\nStill, the current vote is already well over the required participation rate\nthreshold, meaning that its outcome won't be negatively impacted by this bug.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always and especially this time, we strongly recommend updating your Particl\nCore node(s) as soon as possible. Although this issue may be very rare, it does\nimpact the stability of the network and gets more problematic when on-chain\nvoting rounds are ongoing.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

And\nalthough it’s been mentioned a few times before in the weekly progress reports\n[https://particl.news/tag/progress/] or in community chatter, it hasn’t yet been\nofficially announced in detail.\n\nToday changes that.\n\nSummary\nIn this comprehensive blog post, we will reveal all the details of Particl’s\nupcoming major development cycle, what makes it such a big deal, and discover\nhow it’s going to propel the project into its next major evolutionary phase.\n\nIndeed, what’s coming up is the biggest improvement to the Particl ecosystem\nsince the inception of the project in 2017 and the most ambitious undertaking\nthe team has ever planned. It will improve the ecosystem from all angles, making\nit more accessible, user-friendly, and flexible than ever.\n\nThis will result in a suite of easy-to-use and very accessible privacy-first\napplications that anybody can use — bringing uncompromising privacy, liberty,\nand independence into the lives of as many people as ever.\n\nIn many ways, calling this new cycle a major leap forward for Particl would be\nan understatement.

With the web now having\nsuch a prevalent place in our society, this crisis ends up bleeding into every\nsingle aspect of our lives — it affects not only our finances but also our\nprivate communications, our personal and professional lives, and our ability to\ndo almost anything online.\n\nGone are the days of what once was a free and open web. Instead, as we’ve\nrecently explored in various Particl Stories [https://particl.news/tag/stories/]\n, there is a worryingly increasing trend in the rate of censorship, \ngeo-political meddling\n[https://particl.news/unhosted-wallets-and-the-fight-against-out-of-touch-policies/]\n, big tech abuses\n[https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/], \nreckless data mining\n[https://particl.news/the-need-for-an-open-source-revolution/], and various\nagenda-driven actions by the Internet’s largest platform operators.\n\nUndoubtedly, we, as individuals, need to stand up to this takeover and take back\ncontrol of our web. We need to reassert and safeguard our rights to an open,\nfree, and private web environment, as it was originally intended to be, and be\nthe change we want to see in this world!\n\nWhereas certain governments, corporations, or other types of organizations\ncontinue to elevate their level of control and power using the current web\ninfrastructure, there is a growing need to stop fighting on their own turf and,\ninstead, pioneer the digital world of tomorrow in which the rights and freedoms\nof each individual are guaranteed.\n\nWhen accessible and easy to use, disruptive technology — as is the case with\nParticl’s privacy-first dApps — becomes both a shield and a weapon, protecting\nus from digital abuse but also striking back by allowing people to thrive\nwithout interference from the current centralized web infrastructure.\n\nThe Shortcomings of Web3\nThat is, in essence, what Web3 promised to accomplish: a more open, independent,\nand free internet for all. Unfortunately, as we’ve come to discover\n[https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/], what Web3 promises and\nwhat it currently delivers diverges on many fronts. If you dive into its present\nstate, you can see that it’s much more centralized than it first appears —\nrelying, in major parts, on traditional “big tech” infrastructure — and that it\nturns out to be a near disaster in terms of privacy and decentralization.\n\nWeb3 Exposed! Is it Only a Mirage?A cold hard and in-depth look into the\npromises and current realities of “Web3”.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/]Web3, and by association\nDeFi as well, offers a level of financial privacy that is ultimately lower than\neven the traditional banking system. On the latter, only a few parties can\naccess your financial information. That would typically be your bank or the\npayment processor you’re using, government organizations, and their partners.\nWith Web3 services, your financial data, while pseudonymous, is permanently and\npublicly stored for the whole world to see. Anyone curious enough can simply\nlook for the entirety of your information in public records.\n\nCase in point, here are the financial assets of a random public Ethereum user\n[https://debank.com/profile/0xb432863b3857f1cd9d78f5856a8d20693a8bc1a0?chain=eth]\n, their detailed financial history\n[https://etherscan.io/address/0xb432863b3857f1cd9d78f5856a8d20693a8bc1a0], as\nwell as all the NFTs they own\n[https://debank.com/profile/0xb432863b3857f1cd9d78f5856a8d20693a8bc1a0/nft?chain=eth]\n. And while we’ve simply picked a random user that had just traded on Uniswap at\nthe time of this writing, the totality of their financial information is\npermanently out in the open. Anyone that then sends payments to that address is\nable to track, down to the cent, the totality of its owner’s past, present, and\nfuture financial activities; a terrible foundation from which to build the\n“economy or internet of tomorrow”.\n\nWhat’s more, not all Web3 apps are as decentralized and open as they claim, such\nas we’ve seen with Infura, MetaMask\n[https://medium.com/coinmonks/as-metamask-and-opensea-abide-by-us-sanctions-the-russian-ban-is-in-the-spotlight-67611df121f8]\n, and various other dApps that use their services like the not-so-decentralized \nNFT marketplace OpenSea\n[https://cryptobriefing.com/metamask-opensea-blocks-expose-centralization-in-web3/]\n.\n\nWith so many similar examples recently in mind, It’s difficult to see Web3\nsucceed on its stated mission when its biggest and most popular apps end up not\nliving up to their promises at best and, at worst, significantly eroding online\nprivacy and security compared to even Web2.\n\nIn reality, the main problem doesn’t stem from Web3 as a basic concept but\nrather from its poor implementation of the principles required to fulfill its\nmission; a lack of vision from some of Web3’s leaders, or in other cases, the\nsheer pursuit of fast profit, leads to cutting corners and sacrificing the most\ncritical foundations of Web3.\n\nIndeed, it is deluded to think fighting the centralization of powers on the web\ncan be done by building apps and services with less privacy than on traditional\nweb infrastructure or hosting them on said outdated infrastructure. Yet, it\nunfortunately appears to be the direction that Web3 is headed towards.\n\nParticl’s next development cycle is all about steering this ship in the right\ndirection.\n\nBuilding the Right Foundation\nParticl’s new development cycle is about steering Web3 in the right direction by\ngranting it a truly independent and resilient foundation on which privacy-first\ndecentralized applications can be deployed.\n\nBy leveraging the firepower of an ever-growing community of Web3 pioneers\n[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/electric-capital/developer-reports/master/dev_report_2021_updated_012622.pdf] \nand giving them tools that follow a privacy-first approach, a decentralized and\nopen-source alternative to the traditional web infrastructure can be built to\nfight back against the centralization of powers. It is up to all of us to create\na parallel and independent environment that puts individuals at the center —\nsimultaneously armed and shielded with privacy-first dApps — and liberates them\nfrom the ever-tightening noose that is the centralization of powers online and\nall the consequences it brings forth.\n\nAnnouncing Particl’s New Major Development Cycle\nIn a nutshell, Particl’s new development cycle focuses on expanding the\necosystem’s strengths and endowing it with a new, modular infrastructure,\nultimately building a solid foundation on which to easily build and use\nprivacy-first dApps.\n\nBefore we go into further details on this new development cycle, it’s important\nto understand the reasoning behind the journey ahead by first being aware of\nParticl’s strengths and what makes it unique.\n\nWhat Makes Particl Unique?\nParticl is a revolutionary and powerful ecosystem like none other thanks to a\nunique combination of two core components: Particl Blockchain and the\nSecureMessaging network (SMSG).\n\nParticl Blockchain \nThe Particl Blockchain is a unique and powerful blockchain that contains both\nvarious privacy-preserving features (CT, RingCT, stealth addresses, Taproot,\netc) as well as a high level of flexibility.\n\nWhile its native cryptocurrency, PART, allows for untraceable payments to be\nmade (privacy coin)\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd/], the\nblockchain infrastructure allows for the creation of complex, decentralized, and\nprivacy-first applications through the use of smart contracts and scriptless\nscripts (off-chain, private, and scalable smart contracts). This unique\nconvergence of privacy capabilities and application flexibility allows for the\nParticl Blockchain to carve a niche of its own within the blockchain industry\nwith an uncompromising focus on “privacy-first dApps”, such as Particl \nMarketplace [https://particl.io/marketplace] or BasicSwap DEX\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/].\n\n> Note: Although the concept of smart contracts is well known to most people\nwithin the cryptocurrency community, scriptless scripts, on the other hand, tend\nto be less widely known. You can learn more about them here\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex#scriptless-scripts] \nor by reading this in-depth guide\n[https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/introduction-to-scriptless-scripts].\nSecureMessaging Network (SMSG)\nSecureMessaging (SMSG) is a P2P mixnet that allows peers to communicate\nencrypted data with other peers or applications without the need for third\nparties or middlemen. Inspired by the BitMessage protocol\n[https://www.whonix.org/wiki/BitMessage], it stores and transfers data across\nnodes in a privacy-preserving manner, encrypted from end to end (E2EE).\n\nIn other words, SMSG is a decentralized messaging layer that both dApps and\nusers themselves can use. Its usage enables the creation and deployment of much\nmore complex decentralized applications than what can be done using smart\ncontracts exclusively. You can read more on the SMSG network here\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/].\n\nParticl's Four Pillars for the New Digital World\nParticl's unique combination of a private and flexible blockchain with a\ndecentralized mixnet makes possible the creation of advanced privacy-first dApps\nthat protect the rights and liberties of its users.\n\nCompared to the majority of Web3, Particl dApps are a major improvement in terms\nof the values they are committed to. We must capitalize on that potential for\nthe good of not only the project but also the well-being of the internet and\nsociety as a whole.\n\nThe strategic plan to make all of this happen is fourfold:\n\n 1. Deploy a new, more powerful mixnet to expand on the network's capabilities\n    (already well in its conceptualization phase, tentatively named \"SMSG 2.0\")\n 2. Transform Particl into a modular and development-friendly infrastructure\n 3. Deploy new \"access gateways\" (i.e., web, mobile, and SMSG frameworks) to\n    host decentralized applications and interact with them\n 4. Commit as much as possible to an agnostic philosophy\n\nLet's explore these four central aspects of Particl's new strategic plan in more\ndetail.\n\n1. SMSG 2.0 — A Decentralized and Private Internet Protocol\nA big reason why Particl dApps are so unique is due to them leveraging the data\ntransmission and storage capabilities of the SMSG network\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/], which\nruns in parallel but independently to Particl Blockchain nodes. This makes\npossible more advanced features and functionality than traditional\nsmart-contract dApps, as is the case with both the Particl Marketplace and\nBasicSwap DEX dApps.\n\nThe SMSG Network — Enabling Dapps With True PrivacyLearn more about what makes\nParticl decentralized applications truly special and private!Particl News\ncryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/]But\nwhile the SMSG network offers pristine privacy and a very secure, trustless way\nto communicate data between peers, it is not scalable enough to support massive\nlevels of simultaneous usage.\n\nAdditionally, it only allows for data transmission and temporary storage, making\nit more akin to a messaging protocol rather than a fully-fledged internet\ninfrastructure.\n\nAnd so, the first fold of Particl’s new strategic plan is to re-imagine SMSG to\nmake it more scalable and allow for even more advanced functionality —\nessentially doubling down on its strengths and expanding on its use-cases.\n\nAn Open and Decentralized Web Architecture\nTo get groundbreaking results, you sometimes need to think outside the box. It\nis true that the current version of SMSG provides the privacy and capabilities\nwe need to build privacy-first dApps — however, it is limited in terms of how\nmuch usage the network can sustain. Furthermore, updating its current code\nimplementation would only result in marginal scalability improvements due to the\nway it is built.\n\nThat’s why a completely new version of SMSG, built from scratch and with the\nmission of serving as the foundation for the new internet, is required.\n\nDistributed Web Content and dApp Hosting\nA critical new functionality SMSG requires is the ability to not only store data\nbut also host and allow for direct interaction with web content and dApps —\nentirely independently from any traditional web infrastructure (the “world wide\nweb”).\n\nTo put it another way, this major functionality update amounts to transforming\nSMSG from a messaging network into a fully decentralized, independent, free, and\nprivacy-first internet protocol that’s open to all, without restrictions.\n\nWith dApps and web content hosted on — and accessible from — this distributed\nnetwork, it provides a viable alternative for people to opt out completely of\nour current internet infrastructure, which has grown corrupted and toxic over\nthe past few decades. Plus, content and dApps hosted on it become entirely\ncensorship-proof as the decentralized nature of this network shields them from\nany interference from central parties.\n\nNear-Infinite Scalability\nTo be a viable option to boldly act as the foundation for the “internet of\ntomorrow”, SMSG 2.0 requires a linear model of scalability, essentially\nincreasing as more people (nodes) join the network (i.e., by using Particl\ndApps).\n\nThis feat is accomplished by radically changing how data travels between nodes.\nWhereas the current implementation of SMSG broadcasts all messages to all nodes\n— with only those with the proper private keys being able to decrypt the\nmessages’ content — SMSG 2.0 distributes that signal in a more structured\nfashion, with each node routing a (configurable) amount of traffic.\n\nThis effectively increases SMSG’s throughput as more nodes become available. And\nas more people use Particl dApps, more nodes become available, thus ensuring a\nsufficient count to provide the level of scalability any substantial increase in\nadoption requires.\n\n2. A New Modular Architecture\nThe second fold of Particl’s strategic plan is to give the ecosystem a new\nmodular dimension. Because to act as the pillar of the new internet requires a\nsignificant level of community involvement — notably in expanding the pool of\npioneers working on new, exciting decentralized applications and services —\nwe’ve got to ensure that the ecosystem is developer-friendly, coding efficient,\nand that its unique functionality can easily extend into the real world.\n\nParticl’s Current Infrastructure\nUnfortunately, that is not the case currently. Particl’s infrastructure is not\nas open as it could be, and the majority of its development hinges almost\nexclusively on the Particl team.\n\nEven in the event that an outside contributor would like to contribute work by\nbuilding a dApp or distributed service of their own, they require full\ncooperation with the Particl team to be added to Particl Desktop, the project’s\nmain access gateway, and adds up to the team’s responsibilities as it will need\nto keep the new dApp in line with any and all future desktop or core updates.\n\nIn reality, Particl’s current architecture is monolithic in nature, which isn’t\nas much of a problem if the project focuses solely on a single dApp — Particl\nMarketplace — but highly counterproductive and restrictive in the context of\nParticl as the foundation for a better internet protocol.\n\nCooperation Requirements for dApp Maintenance and Integration\nOne of Particl's current main issues is its architecture is very monolithic.\nEven though the Particl Marketplace may look like an application independent\nfrom Particl Desktop, it is not.\n\nIndeed, the code for Particl Marketplace is deeply intertwined with the Particl\nDesktop's codebase, essentially requiring the latter to access and use it. In\nthat sense, Particl Marketplace is more of a Particl Desktop feature rather than\na standalone dApp.\n\nParticl's new upcoming modular architecture remedies that by allowing for a much\ngreater level of independence between dApps (Particl Marketplace) and access\ngateways (Particl Desktop).\n\nEnabling the Ability to Re-Use Functionality Already Implemented on Other DApps\nNot only do outside contributors currently require the full cooperation of the\nParticl team to maintain and deploy their dApps, or even integrate Particl dApps\ninto their own products, but they also need to re-implement all key\nfunctionalities, even if already provided by other dApps, from scratch.\n\nLet’s take, for example, the hypothetical scenario where a community-funded\ndeveloper wishes to work on an end-to-end encrypted messenger dApp using the\nmessaging capabilities offered by the SMSG network. Naturally, one would\ninstantly take a look at Particl Marketplace and reuse its implementation of\nSMSG’s messaging functionality (as it is used to allow sellers and buyers to\ncommunicate with each other). However, that is not exactly possible.\n\nBecause even the most basic and key capabilities of the network must be\nhard-coded into Particl dApps, it is impossible to leverage implementations of\ndesired functionalities in other Dapps. Every single function instead requires\nto be re-implemented all over again.\n\nAgain, this is not a deal breaker for a project that focuses exclusively on one\ndApp. But for an ecosystem that aspires to become a foundation for a new,\nparallel internet, this must change to become more open and scalable.\n\nIntroducing Particl Modules and the Developer SDK\nTo remedy that situation, the Particl team will adopt a modular approach from\nnow on — isolating every core feature, functionality, and component of its\necosystem into a set of developer-friendly modules that can be added, removed,\nconfigured, and managed into a dApp (i.e., Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap DEX)\nor an access gateway (i.e., Particl Desktop, third-party wallet) independently.\n\nModules\nIn this context, a module refers to a readily-available packaged set of code,\nlibraries, and logic that provides a functionality, feature, or service to an\nexternal environment (i.e., a dApp). They grant dApps critical and/or common\nParticl features, allowing contributors to focus on what makes their own dApp\nunique rather than spending time reimplementing fundamental or complex\nfunctions.\n\nDeveloper SDK\nParticl’s upcoming SDK will empower developers to build various dApps using a \nstandardized set of development tools and documentation. Not only does the SDK\nimprove dApp security by ensuring their critical components are safely\nimplemented, but it also makes it easy and straightforward for developers to\nbuild privacy-first dApps. If the modules are the building blocks that\ndevelopers use to build dApps, the SDK is the glue that binds them together in a\nstructured and standardized way.\n\nAccess gateways\nThis term refers to any platform, app, or framework from which a dApp is\naccessed and used. This can be a desktop client like Particl Desktop, a web or\nSMSG page, a mobile application, or even a third-party integration.\n\nThe Mobile Apps vs Particl dApps Comparison\nA good analogy to better illustrate this new modular concept is by comparing\nParticl dApps to iOS or Android apps. Once installed on a phone, mobile\napplications, in a sense, take the form of independent “modules” that do not\nneed direct access to the underlying hardware features.\n\nInstead, should an app require access to the device’s camera, it requests\npermission to use the OS’s pre-packaged module that grants access rights to\nthird-party applications. This means the mobile team does not need to\nre-implement all the code and logic around using a device’s camera; it merely\nrequests this functionality from the OS.\nThis, in many ways, is the same way Particl modules function. Each of them\nprovides a functionality that dApp developers can simply query access to.\n\nNot only is this a critical step in making Particl more open to outside\ncontributors, but it’s also making the entire ecosystem much more resilient\nagainst outside interference by decentralizing and making more independent the\nway dApps are developed and maintained.\n\nDeploying Particl’s Key Modules\nAmong the wide variety of functionality and services that can be isolated into\nmodules, here are a few of which the team will initially focus on as we embark\non this new development phase.\n\n * Blockchain node modules (to integrate other cryptocurrencies)\n * Payment module (to provide payment solutions)\n * Market-related modules (to provide out-of-the-box eCommerce services)\n * Two-party escrow system (to provide trade assurance)\n * SMSG — End-to-end encrypted chat (for safe communications)\n * SMSG — Decentralized storage (to store data online)\n * SMSG — Decentralized hosting (to host web content and dApps)\n * SMSG — Controller module (to process, interpret, and interact with SMSG\n   messages (back-end services for developers))\n * Swap modules (including BasicSwap, to swap cryptocurrencies)\n * Staking module (to integrate PART staking capabilities)\n * Third-party integrations (to integrate extraneous protocols such as Tor, PGP,\n   i2p, IPFS, other mixnets, etc.)\n\nNote that other functionalities, features, or entire dApps can and will be\nisolated into modules as well. The above list merely showcases the most critical\nones but doesn’t go over all possibilities.\n\nHow Does This Benefit Particl?\nThe ecosystem's modular evolution introduces many benefits critical to the\nsuccess of Particl. Let's go over the main ones.\n\nMakes development easier and increases production pace\nWith a proper SDK toolkit at the disposal of developers, it becomes easier to\ndevelop an application when not having to deal with various setup and\nmaintenance burdens.\n\nCurrently, each new dApp added to Particl Desktop is built directly into the\nclient, meaning that each app needs to consider how the entire desktop client\nfits together, as well as how the current dApp impacts each of the other\nbuilt-in apps.\n\nFor example, the marketplace messaging system that is currently built into the\nmarketplace needs to be aware of how the whole dApp handles SMSG messages simply\nbecause it itself requires messaging capabilities. Therefore, any change to how\nParticl Marketplace handles messages requires changes to be made to the\nmessaging system implementation as well, essentially doubling the amount of work\nrequired and making any new feature or implementation a permanent development\nburden to maintain.\n\nThis type of situation can be avoided by isolating this messaging feature into\nan independent and standardized module, allowing dApp developers to simply\nrequest an out-of-the-box chat functionality from the appropriate module instead\nof creating it from scratch.\n\nThis will significantly speed up the development of dApps and facilitate\ncommunity contributions by making it easier, faster, and more straightforward to\nbuild dApps that ensure users’ rights are respected.\n\nMake dApp maintenance independent from the Particl team or platform they’re\nhosted on\nAdding to the benefit mentioned above, the introduction of modules makes dApps\nentirely independent from the Particl team and the access gateway they're made\navailable on.\n\nLet's use the popular Steam gaming platform as an example to better illustrate\nwhat this means.\n\nSteam was originally built to distribute Valve Software's games and updates to\nthose games, after which it grew to become a general gaming \"launcher\" platform.\nAs a result, it is today one of the most well-known means of obtaining games\nonline.\n\nWhen a game installed on Steam requires an update, it can be updated on its own,\nby the game development team, without requiring a Steam client-wide update. If\nthe Steam team needed to maintain, fix, and push updates for each game they host\non their ecosystem, it would quickly become an unscalable and highly impractical\nsituation.\n\nThat is, however, how the Particl ecosystem currently functions. Once a dApp or\nnew feature is settled on and integrated into the current Particl Desktop\nclient, the burden of maintenance falls on the Particl development team. In\naddition, the original author of a dApp or feature, which may or may not be a\nParticl team member, might no longer wish or be able to maintain the code, thus\ntransferring all these responsibilities to the Particl team for all future\nParticl Desktop releases.\n\nAnd then, even if the dApp author keeps on contributing, knowledge of all future\nplanned updates and changes to any portion of the Particl code is required by\nthe author as it may affect their own dApp and require adaptation coding work.\n\nUltimately, this causes Particl Desktop releases to become increasingly\ndependent on timely contributions from said authors, leading to delays and\ninefficiencies. In the context of a wide and open dApp ecosystem, it is an\nunmaintainable situation.\n\nThe new modular architecture eliminates these issues and enables independent\ndApp developers to develop and maintain their products separately from the\nParticl team or Particl Desktop releases schedules and according to their own\nterms.\n\nFaster rollout for updates, new features, and bug fixes\nRight now, a bug fix to a dApp such as Particl Marketplace requires an entire\nParticl Desktop client release. A bug fix under the new scenario can be rolled\nout as soon as the author feels it's ready, without needing to consider an\nentire client update or involve the Particl team.\n\nThat's because the bug fix, in that case, would be pushed not to the desktop\nclient itself but to the precise module affected by it, which then gets\nautomatically updated on all dApps that use that module.\n\nThis, again, takes the responsibility off of the Particl team and lets it focus\non the greater vision while contributors can promptly push their own fixes and\nmanage their apps without relying on the team's actions.\n\nFor example, if a dApp uses a Tor module to route traffic through Tor, it\nwouldn't need an ecosystem-wide update whenever Tor pushes an update to their\nnetwork. The update would instead be automatically applied to the module,\nensuring that all Particl dApps with Tor functionality are kept up-to-date with\nsecurity fixes.\n\nThis is a major stride towards better dApp security and more timely updates.\n\nIn Summary\nParticl's new modular architecture opens many doors, essentially transforming\nthe Particl ecosystem into a privacy-conscious and decentralized foundation for\nthe new internet.\n\nThis new approach can be broadly summarized in three key points:\n\n 1. The Particl ecosystem isn't any more a single big block of code; instead, it\n    is separated into independent modules, making it more open, accessible, and\n    developer-friendly than ever. It is also more resilient against central\n    points of failure.\n 2. Instead of requiring developers to re-implement all key functionalities,\n    dApps can simply request it to a particular module without building\n    everything or integrating everything from scratch, much like the example of\n    mobile OSes and mobile apps we've highlighted just above.\n 3. DApps become entirely independent from the Particl team, the wider Particl\n    ecosystem, and the access gateway on which they're made available.\n\n3. Access Gateways and dApp Accessibility\nOne of the most important goals of this new development cycle is to improve\naccessibility to Particl dApps so that they can be used by almost anyone,\nwithout complicated steps, and to stop relying exclusively on a single desktop\napplication for all purposes. This third fold of Particl's strategic plan is a\ncritical aspect in getting any sort of organic and sustained adoption.\n\nAs such, Particl's new modular approach makes it much easier to integrate\nmodules, or whole dApps, into different access gateways such as web or mobile\nframeworks or even into third-party applications.\n\nWeb Access\nHowever, as we’ve explored\n[https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/], hosting dApps on top\nof the current and centralized web environment, while highly convenient, carries\ncritical vulnerabilities and heavy downsides. With these challenges in mind, we\nplan on enabling alternative web hosting solutions, notably through SMSG 2.0’s\ncontent hosting capabilities.\n\nIndeed, as we’ve mentioned earlier, SMSG 2.0 is scheduled to evolve from a\ndistributed messaging protocol into a full-blown internet protocol more akin to\nsomething like Tor or i2p, eventually enabling dApps to be hosted on it and\naccessed from web browsers.\n\nOf course, with Particl becoming so flexible and open to community contributors,\nwe fully expect more traditional web and mobile versions of Particl dApps (i.e.,\nParticl Marketplace, BasicSwap DEX, two-party escrow system, end-to-end\nencrypted messenger) to be made available. The team also intends to deliver such\nsolutions to provide more options to the end-user.\n\nA New Modular Particl Desktop\nJust like the rest of the ecosystem, Particl Desktop will become a modular\nclient, enabling the end-user to add, remove, and configure dApps as they wish.\nThis promotes openness and choice and ensures that users do not need to install\nevery Particl dApp, some of which they may have no use for.\n\nFor example, one might not care about the Governance dApp, but the user is still\ncurrently forced to have it available because it is hard-coded into Particl\nDesktop. Alternatively, a user may not want to run the marketplace at all.\nStill, they are required to do so and, by the same process, spend computer\nresources decrypting all SMSG messages related to it (i.e., listings).\n\nWith a modular approach, the user could simply remove the marketplace dApp from\ntheir Particl Desktop application or simply never have to install it in the\nfirst place.\n\nDApp Store\nTo promote Particl’s vision, a “dApp store” may be made available, on which a\nlist of official or recommended dApps would be featured with the ability for\nindependent contributors to push their own dApps and modules to it.\n\nOf course, in the spirit of openness and decentralization, the dApp store will\nbe a convenient but optional platform for interacting with those dApps. As\nopen-source applications, it will be possible to download or install them via\nother ways as well.\n\n4. Currency and Protocol Agnosticism\nTo further promote openness and become an all-inclusive foundation for the\ninternet of tomorrow, Particl is fully embracing the concept of agnosticism by\nensuring its ecosystem can remain compatible with other cryptocurrencies and\nprotocols. This is the fourth fold of Particl's strategic plan.\n\nCurrency Agnosticism\nAs part of the range of modules available to developers will be\ncryptocurrency-specific modules that makes it possible for certain dApps to\nsupport other cryptocurrencies (i.e., Bitcoin).\n\nAlthough not all cryptocurrencies may be able to use all Particl features and\nservices (some of them requiring very specific functionality unique to the PART\nprivacy coin), this will extend the ecosystem's reach by welcoming other\ncryptocurrency communities and providing them with more utility for their coin.\n\nWhen a cryptocurrency cannot use a specific Particl functionality, a swap\nmodule, like BasicSwap DEX, for example, can be added to let the end-user swap\ntheir coins for PART or even have the dApp execute that action automatically as\na background process. This will allow holders of other cryptocurrencies to\nseamlessly benefit from Particl-specific features without negatively affecting\nthe user experience.\n\nIn the exact same way, a fiat gateway module, such as a service offering credit\ncard purchases of cryptocurrencies, can be added to the ecosystem and leveraged\nby dApp developers to provide added functionality to their products — further\nbridging the gap between the legacy payment industry and the world of\ncryptocurrencies.\n\nProtocol Agnosticism\nBecause dApps are developed using modules, it is possible to leverage protocols\nthat are not native to the Particl ecosystem to build some of their features.\n\nFor example, SMSG provides chat functionality to dApps through its messaging\nmodule. But a developer could decide to instead integrate a different messaging\nprotocol, like matrix [https://matrix.org/], which powers the Element Messenger\n[https://riot.im/app/#/room/#particl-project:matrix.org]. This would still grant\nthe dApp with messaging capabilities, but a different protocol would power it.\n\nThere are three main reasons behind this approach. For one, distinct protocols\nhave different pros and cons. Some use cases may get more out of a particular\nprotocol, while a different dApp may find it more efficient to use another. This\ngives more flexibility to developers and lets them work with what they think is\nin the best interest of their users.\n\nSecondly, it makes Particl dApps more resistant to the test of time. As\ntechnology evolves very rapidly, it is not rare to see major protocol\ninnovations appear. And because it's likely that, over time, better versions of\nprotocols used to build dApps become available, developers require the ability\nto seamlessly swap protocols to keep up with the evolutionary curve. In other\nwords, it makes it significantly easier to keep Particl dApps up-to-date with\nthe most recent progress in the space, ensuring the user gets the most of what\nis possible at the time that they use a dApp.\n\nFinally, it also makes dApps more secure and resilient against attacks. For\nexample, if a vulnerability is found in the protocol powering a certain dApp,\nits developer can simply swap the faulty module for an unaffected alternative.\nThis lets developers act quickly when there are security issues while preserving\nthe integrity of the other components of a dApp.\n\nNew Particl dApps are Coming Around\nParticl’s new modular approach opens up a ton of opportunities. Not only does it\nenable more efficient and secure dApps, but it also completely opens up its\ndevelopment process to the world.\n\nMoreover, with Particl’s CCS platform [https://ccs.particl.io], anyone can\npublish proposals seeking to fund the development of various dApps, creating a\nfully self-perpetuating economy and environment. And we know the Particl\ncommunity is not short of ideas! Indeed, once the modular architecture is\ndeployed, we fully expect to see a rapid increase in the number of community-led\ninitiatives.\n\nThat being said, the Particl team will, of course, be working on its own dApps\nnot only to showcase what is possible with the improved Particl infrastructure\nbut also to lead the way towards a better, fairer digital world for all.\n\nHere are dApps or services the Particl team will work on once different\ncomponents of the modular infrastructure go live.\n\nNew version of the marketplace This development cycle changes the back-end of\nthe ecosystem so much that a completely new version of the marketplace will need\nto be deployed. \n\nMore flexible, fast, and agnostic than the current version, it will offer the\nsame functionality but in a much more accessible way. In addition, the\nmarketplace will be designed so that its part, or its whole, can be integrated\ninto different access gateways like a website, mobile application, or\nthird-party integrations; all are cross-compatible. \n\nAlso, because of its cleaner, modular codebase, any future development, such as\nthe development of new features, will be dramatically sped up from the current\ntypical pace. \n\nin-progress waiting done Mobile version of the marketplace In just a few years,\nmobile devices are expected to be the preferential way people shop online. How\nmany times have any of us purchased goods on the internet using our phones?\nCountless times, we’re sure. \n\nThe reality, however, is different for sellers who, for the vast majority,\nmanage their business from desktop or laptop computers. \n\nThat is why one of Particl’s first dApps will be a buyer-focused mobile version\nof Particl Marketplace. This dApp will use the new modular approach of the\necosystem and showcase the use of a mobile access gateway into which Particl\ndApps will then be able to be integrated. \n\nin-progress waiting done Privacy-first messenger app Think Signal or Telegram,\nbut 100% decentralized and open-source. A privacy-first messenger application\ncould be deployed relatively easily on mobile and desktop environments.\nMoreover, because it only requires SMSG modules, such a dApp could likely become\navailable before even the release of the new version of the marketplace, as the\nlatter requires more modules to be put together in order to function and carries\na higher level of complexity. After all, because SMSG’s messaging capability is\nexpected to be used heavily in the future, it only makes sense to isolate it\ninto a proper standalone app or module early on. \n\nBesides, it will serve as an excellent showcase for the new SMSG 2.0 network and\nmobile access gateways. \n\nin-progress waiting done Standalone escrow app and integrations As a way to\ndemonstrate the integrability of modules, the Particl team may work on a\nshowcase in which a two-party escrow option becomes available on a new mobile\nwallet. \n\nAs we’ve discussed here\n[https://particl.news/an-overview-of-particls-two-party-escrow/], Particl’s\nnovel two-party escrow system has a wide range of use cases, all the way to\nin-person trade, and enabling this type of escrow outside of Particl Marketplace\nwill allow us to tap into and reach more of these possibilities. \n\nin-progress waiting done Third-party integrations The modular approach's\nintegration potential works in two ways: it, for one, allows Particl dApps to be\nintegrated into existing eCommerce platforms (i.e., a WooCommerce payment plugin\nwith two-party escrow contracts), but it also allows third-party services to be\nintegrated right into dApps as modules (i.e., a third-party inventory management\nsystem that a seller may be using on other platforms). \n\nAs such, you can expect, over time, a wide range of integrations to be made\navailable on the Particl dApp store or other popular platforms — in the form of\na WooCommerce plugin, for example. \n\nin-progress waiting done Timeline\nThis new major development cycle is expected to last from 12 to 18 months, with\nthe current team size, and start right after the release of Particl Desktop 3.3\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-3-what-to-expect/].\n\nHowever, the team has recently actively been looking for external funding and\npitching to various investors. Following a successful funding round, we fully\nintend on growing the development team (as well as other departments like\nmarketing and community too) to fill various key positions that will\nsignificantly speed up the process.\n\nPlease refer to the roadmap below for a general overview of the path forward. As\nalways, as we're dealing with moving targets and pioneering entirely new\ntechnology, the roadmap is likely to be updated and adjusted as we go.\n\n> Note: We will publish the pitch deck and Particl's new whitepaper, which we're\nboth using to pitch to investors, shortly into the future.\nFollow the Development Updates\nOnce this new major development cycle begins, right after the release of Particl\nDesktop 3.3, we will shift the focus from reporting development progress on\nParticl Desktop toward the greater Particl ecosystem. This will be reflected in\nthe way we report our weekly progress reports\n[https://particl.news/tag/progress/].\n\nFAQ\nWill Particl Desktop, Marketplace, and BasicSwap DEX continue to function during\nthis new development cycle? Yes. The new versions of these products will be\nbuilt in parallel to existing Particl dApps. Therefore, there will be no changes\nto the availability of current dApps while the improvements to the ecosystem are\nbeing made, and they will still be maintained as required. Only when new\nversions of these applications are launched will the legacy versions be\ndeprecated. \n\nin-progress waiting done Does adding the ability to use other coins within the\necosystem render PART useless? Absolutely not. PART is and will remain a\ncritical component of the Particl ecosystem. It is what powers its transactional\nprivacy and is a requirement for interacting with some of the more complex\nParticl smart contracts. Remember, what makes PART unique is that it possesses\nboth privacy and flexibility, a key aspect to many functions provided by Particl\ndApps that other cryptocurrencies cannot replicate. \n\nFor example, while an application built using Particl modules may allow for\nMonero payments, Monero still cannot be used with something like Particl’s\ntwo-party escrow system. In that case, the dApp’s developer may instead use a\npayment module, then a swap module to allow users to easily swap their Monero\nfor PART. This would let Monero users benefit from some of the more advanced\nmarketplace functions, such as its escrow capabilities, while still interacting\nwith it using Monero even if the payment ultimately settles in PART. \n\nOn the other hand, if a dApp requires simple payments to be made (for instance,\nsending Monero through messages sent via the upcoming messenger application),\nthen it may be possible to use Monero directly without having to route the\npayment through PART. \n\nWe aim to build an open and free ecosystem for all; forcing people to use a\nsingle cryptocurrency when they could be using others goes against that ethos.\nBy opening up the Particl ecosystem to the wider cryptocurrency community, we\nsignificantly increase the range of potential Particl dApps users and\nsuccessfully bring new levels of liberty and privacy to more people. After all,\nthis is Particl’s fundamental mission. \n\nin-progress waiting done Doesn’t this evolutionary process open up the door for\nmore centralization? Because Particl is about to become much more open-ended and\neasy to work with, businesses or independent developers may be interested in\ncoding dApps that are more centralized than, for example, the current version of\nParticl Marketplace (which makes no compromise whatsoever on that end). But at\nthe end of the day, it becomes up to the user to use that \"more centralized\"\nservice or a more open/decentralized/private service instead, basing their\ndecision on what's best for them. \n\nNonetheless, even when accounting for future, more centralized applications,\ntheir inclusion in the ecosystem brings considerable benefits at the level of\ndecentralization. \n\nFirst, it decentralizes the development process of the entire ecosystem by\ngiving easy-to-use tools for developers and business people all around the\nworld. No more will the platform's growth entirely depend on the core Particl\ndevelopment team — the new open and modular infrastructure will make it very\neasy for anyone to work on their own vision of Particl. This also radically\nimproves the resilience of the network as a whole. \n\nSecondly, combined with the CCS crowdfunding platform, this will positively\nimpact the amount and efficiency of contributions from the community as it will\nbe possible to self-fund great ideas using the treasury system, then realize\nthem using easy-to-use dev tools. Particl is blessed to have a strong community\nthat often comes up with great and revolutionary ideas, which we, the Particl\nteam, are excited about but unable to give the time they would require (because\nof the current maintenance requirements and our own roadmap). This new\nevolutionary leap forward fixes that obstacle. \n\nThe evolution of Particl's architecture to a modular one changes everything and\ngives all the power to users. Anyone with a great idea or who wishes to create a\ncertain dApp on Particl can easily submit a proposal, get it approved by the\ncommunity for funding, and either code it themselves or find a third-party\ndeveloper to do it. Using modules, bringing an idea to life will be possible for\nalmost any Web3 developer. \n\nin-progress waiting done Does Particl have the funds required to make all of\nthat happen? Although the current price of PART presents a challenge in terms of\ngrowth for the team, we’ve got enough funds to last for the duration of this\ndevelopment cycle at the current pace. \n\nHowever, we've recently been actively working on raising funds from external\ninvestors to complement the monthly claims from the network's treasury and\naccelerate our progress. Although we cannot reveal more information about it at\nthis time, we will publish our pitch deck and Particl's new whitepaper, which\nwe're both using to pitch, shortly into the future. \n\nin-progress waiting done How does the team expects to deliver on this with its\nsmall size? Any plans to grow the team? An aspect of this development cycle's\nstrategy is to grow the development team to help on the various components and\ndApp projects. But, of course, this is highly contingent on the amount of\nfunding at our disposal, whether through better PART prices or external funding.\nThis is why we've recently made raising funds one of our top priorities. \n\nBesides, one of the critical goal of this cycle is to further decentralize the\ndevelopment process to allow more independent developers to contribute to the\necosystem on their own. This will reduce the burden on the Particl team and\nallow for more people to help the network grow. \n\nin-progress waiting done What about marketing in all of this? Again, the scale\nand timing of marketing efforts is equally contingent on the amount of funding\nat the team's disposal. And although this evolutionary leap forward is mostly\ndevelopment-focused — as it deals with foundational work — we still have\ndifferent marketing and communications initiatives ready to deploy as soon as\nfinancial capabilities permit. \n\nBut, at its core, this \"foundational phase\" is a necessary step that will result\nin much more accessible, user-friendly, and convenient dApps — a critical factor\nthat affects both user acquisition and retention, and also leads to better\nmarketing ROI. For this reason, it is, in many ways, a long-term play towards\nfuture marketing and outreach efforts, ensuring Particl dApps live up to the\nhype of the marketing efforts that will promote them. \n\nIn addition, this entire phase expands on the ecosystem’s use cases and target\naudiences — essentially vastly increasing our pool of potential users. The team\nfully expects to capitalize on this opportunity by carefully and gradually\nincreasing marketing and outreach efforts as we progress through this cycle’s\ncritical milestones, notably as we incrementally release new products and major\nupdates. \n\nin-progress waiting done Does that mean that dApps like Particl Marketplace\ncould be integrated into other cryptocurrency wallets? Yes. Even further, it\nmeans that any Particl dApp can be ‘white labeled’ or re-interpreted by anyone.\nA cryptocurrency project could, for example, integrate Particl Marketplace into\nits own coin wallet, take out the escrow, and force payments to be made\nexclusively using their cryptocurrency. Then, to pay for the SMSG anti-spam fee,\nthey could simply build a system around a swap module like BasicSwap to\nautomatically and seamlessly exchange their native coin to PART to pay for\nlisting fees. \n\nIn fact, there is great potential for these sorts of projects. Third-party\nintegrations and white-labeled solutions can help more communities thrive by\nreaping the network's liberty and privacy benefits. It can also generate revenue\nfor the project in a way that's mutually beneficial for all parties involved.\nThis will be an important aspect of Particl's adoption and go-to-market strategy\nas we incrementally release new products. \n\nin-progress waiting done Will the current version of SMSG be deprecated? No,\nSMSG 1.0 is not planned to be deprecated for the moment, even when SMSG 2.0\ncomes out. Instead, they will run parallel to each other as their differences\nmake up for varying pros and cons, which may be better suited for different\nuse-cases. \n\nin-progress waiting done How long is this development cycle expected to last? \nDelivering the envisioned future of Particl in full is no small task and is\nexpected to last 12 to 18 months, assuming no additional (external) source of\nfunding for the team. However, this time estimate will likely improve as we\ngradually grow the team and fill various key positions following a successful\nfunding round. However, it's important to note that these months spent working\nthrough this development phase will be far from uneventful as we have planned\nseveral incremental releases. Therefore, 12 to 18 months is the estimate for the\nentire process to be over, but in the meantime, you can expect different\nexciting releases to keep things very interesting. \n\nFor example, while it may take longer to release the new version of Particl\nMarketplace, largely due to its complexity and the sheer number of modules it\nuses, SMSG 2.0 or the privacy-first messenger app might launch before that time.\nThat’s because the new version of Particl Marketplace uses many different\nmodules which, individually, will be ready at different points in time. \n\nIn the case of the privacy-first messenger app, it is, at its core, a much\nsimpler dApp. Because it uses fewer modules than Particl Marketplace, it would\nbe much easier and quicker to deploy. And since the messaging function of SMSG\nis expected to be leveraged by many future dApp, it only makes sense to deploy\nit early on into the process. \n\nin-progress waiting done","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"></figure><p>If you’ve been following Particl closely, then you may have heard whispers that the Particl team is gearing up to undertake a new major development cycle.

Instead, as we’ve recently explored in various <a href=\"https://particl.news/tag/stories/\">Particl Stories</a>, there is a worryingly increasing trend in the rate of censorship, <a href=\"https://particl.news/unhosted-wallets-and-the-fight-against-out-of-touch-policies/\">geo-political meddling</a>, <a href=\"https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/\">big tech abuses</a>, <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-need-for-an-open-source-revolution/\">reckless data mining</a>, and various agenda-driven actions by the Internet’s largest platform operators.</p><p>Undoubtedly, we, as individuals, need to stand up to this takeover and take back control of our web.

On the latter, only a few parties can access your financial information. That would typically be your bank or the payment processor you’re using, government organizations, and their partners. With Web3 services, your financial data, while pseudonymous, is permanently and publicly stored for the whole world to see. Anyone curious enough can simply look for the entirety of your information in public records.</p><p>Case in point, here are <a href=\"https://debank.com/profile/0xb432863b3857f1cd9d78f5856a8d20693a8bc1a0?chain=eth\">the financial assets of a random public Ethereum user</a>, <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xb432863b3857f1cd9d78f5856a8d20693a8bc1a0\">their detailed financial history</a>, <a href=\"https://debank.com/profile/0xb432863b3857f1cd9d78f5856a8d20693a8bc1a0/nft?chain=eth\">as well as all the NFTs they own</a>.

This makes possible more advanced features and functionality than traditional smart-contract dApps, as is the case with both the Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap DEX dApps.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">The SMSG Network — Enabling Dapps With True Privacy</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Learn more about what makes Particl decentralized applications truly special and private!</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://particl.news/icons/icon-512x512.png\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Particl News</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">cryptoguard</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://particl.news/static/6b2dad3b47be647f145e4bbace6c1950/smsg_network-medium-2.jpg\"></div></a></figure><p>But while the SMSG network offers pristine privacy and a very secure, trustless way to communicate data between peers, it is not scalable enough to support massive levels of simultaneous usage.</p><p>Additionally, it only allows for data transmission and temporary storage, making it more akin to a messaging protocol rather than a fully-fledged internet infrastructure.</p><p>And so, the <strong>first fold of Particl’s new strategic plan is to re-imagine SMSG to make it more scalable and allow for even more advanced functionality</strong> — essentially doubling down on its strengths and expanding on its use-cases.</p><h3 id=\"an-open-and-decentralized-web-architecture\">An Open and Decentralized Web Architecture</h3><p>To get groundbreaking results, you sometimes need to think outside the box. It is true that the current version of SMSG provides the privacy and capabilities we need to build privacy-first dApps — however, it is limited in terms of how much usage the network can sustain. Furthermore, updating its current code implementation would only result in marginal scalability improvements due to the way it is built.</p><p>That’s why a completely new version of SMSG, built from scratch and with the mission of serving as the foundation for the new internet, is required.</p><h4 id=\"distributed-web-content-and-dapp-hosting\">Distributed Web Content and dApp Hosting</h4><p>A critical new functionality SMSG requires is the ability to not only store data but also <strong>host and allow for direct interaction with web content and dApps</strong> — entirely independently from any traditional web infrastructure (the “world wide web”).</p><p>To put it another way, this major functionality update amounts to transforming SMSG from a messaging network into a fully decentralized, independent, free, and privacy-first internet protocol that’s open to all, without restrictions.</p><p>With dApps and web content hosted on — and accessible from — this distributed network, it provides a viable alternative for people to opt out completely of our current internet infrastructure, which has grown corrupted and toxic over the past few decades. Plus, content and dApps hosted on it become entirely censorship-proof as the decentralized nature of this network shields them from any interference from central parties.</p><h4 id=\"near-infinite-scalability\">Near-Infinite Scalability</h4><p>To be a viable option to boldly act as the foundation for the “internet of tomorrow”, SMSG 2.0 requires a linear model of scalability, essentially increasing as more people (nodes) join the network (i.e., by using Particl dApps).</p><p>This feat is accomplished by radically changing how data travels between nodes. Whereas the current implementation of SMSG broadcasts all messages to all nodes — with only those with the proper private keys being able to decrypt the messages’ content — <strong>SMSG 2.0 distributes that signal in a more structured fashion, with each node routing a (configurable) amount of traffic</strong>.</p><p>This effectively increases SMSG’s throughput as more nodes become available. And as more people use Particl dApps, more nodes become available, thus ensuring a sufficient count to provide the level of scalability any substantial increase in adoption requires.</p><h2 id=\"2-a-new-modular-architecture\">2. A New Modular Architecture</h2><p><strong>The second fold of Particl’s strategic plan is to give the ecosystem a new modular dimension.</strong> Because to act as the pillar of the new internet requires a significant level of community involvement — notably in expanding the pool of pioneers working on new, exciting decentralized applications and services — we’ve got to ensure that the ecosystem is developer-friendly, coding efficient, and that its unique functionality can easily extend into the real world.</p><h3 id=\"particl-s-current-infrastructure\">Particl’s Current Infrastructure</h3><p>Unfortunately, that is not the case currently. Particl’s infrastructure is not as open as it could be, and the majority of its development hinges almost exclusively on the Particl team.</p><p>Even in the event that an outside contributor would like to contribute work by building a dApp or distributed service of their own, they require full cooperation with the Particl team to be added to Particl Desktop, the project’s main access gateway, and adds up to the team’s responsibilities as it will need to keep the new dApp in line with any and all future desktop or core updates.</p><p>In reality, Particl’s current architecture is monolithic in nature, which isn’t as much of a problem if the project focuses solely on a single dApp — Particl Marketplace — but highly counterproductive and restrictive in the context of Particl as the foundation for a better internet protocol.</p><h4 id=\"cooperation-requirements-for-dapp-maintenance-and-integration\">Cooperation Requirements for dApp Maintenance and Integration</h4><p>One of Particl's current main issues is its architecture is very monolithic. Even though the Particl Marketplace may look like an application independent from Particl Desktop, it is not.</p><p>Indeed, the code for Particl Marketplace is deeply intertwined with the Particl Desktop's codebase, essentially requiring the latter to access and use it. In that sense, Particl Marketplace is more of a Particl Desktop feature rather than a standalone dApp.</p><p>Particl's new upcoming modular architecture remedies that by allowing for a much greater level of independence between dApps (Particl Marketplace) and access gateways (Particl Desktop).</p><h4 id=\"enabling-the-ability-to-re-use-functionality-already-implemented-on-other-dapps\">Enabling the Ability to Re-Use Functionality Already Implemented on Other DApps</h4><p>Not only do outside contributors currently require the full cooperation of the Particl team to maintain and deploy their dApps, or even integrate Particl dApps into their own products, but they also need to re-implement all key functionalities, even if already provided by other dApps, from scratch.</p><p>Let’s take, for example, the hypothetical scenario where a community-funded developer wishes to work on an end-to-end encrypted messenger dApp using the messaging capabilities offered by the SMSG network. Naturally, one would instantly take a look at Particl Marketplace and reuse its implementation of SMSG’s messaging functionality (as it is used to allow sellers and buyers to communicate with each other). However, that is not exactly possible.</p><p>Because even the most basic and key capabilities of the network must be hard-coded into Particl dApps, it is impossible to leverage implementations of desired functionalities in other Dapps. Every single function instead requires to be re-implemented all over again.</p><p>Again, this is not a deal breaker for a project that focuses exclusively on one dApp. But for an ecosystem that aspires to become a foundation for a new, parallel internet, this must change to become more open and scalable.</p><h3 id=\"introducing-particl-modules-and-the-developer-sdk\">Introducing Particl Modules and the Developer SDK</h3><p>To remedy that situation, the Particl team will adopt a modular approach from now on — isolating every core feature, functionality, and component of its ecosystem into a set of developer-friendly <strong>modules</strong> that can be added, removed, configured, and managed into a dApp (i.e., Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap DEX) or an access gateway (i.e., Particl Desktop, third-party wallet) independently.</p><h4 id=\"modules\">Modules</h4><p>In this context, a<strong> module </strong>refers to a<strong> readily-available packaged set of code, libraries, and logic that provides a functionality, feature, or service to an external environment (i.e., a dApp)</strong>. They grant dApps critical and/or common Particl features, allowing contributors to focus on what makes their own dApp unique rather than spending time reimplementing fundamental or complex functions.</p><h4 id=\"developer-sdk\">Developer SDK</h4><p>Particl’s upcoming SDK will empower developers to build various dApps using a <strong>standardized set of development tools and documentation</strong>. Not only does the SDK improve dApp security by ensuring their critical components are safely implemented, but it also makes it easy and straightforward for developers to build privacy-first dApps. If the modules are the building blocks that developers use to build dApps, the SDK is the glue that binds them together in a structured and standardized way.</p><h4 id=\"access-gateways\">Access gateways</h4><p>This term refers to any platform, app, or framework from which a dApp is accessed and used. This can be a desktop client like Particl Desktop, a web or SMSG page, a mobile application, or even a third-party integration.</p><h3 id=\"the-mobile-apps-vs-particl-dapps-comparison\">The Mobile Apps vs Particl dApps Comparison</h3><p>A good analogy to better illustrate this new modular concept is by comparing Particl dApps to iOS or Android apps. Once installed on a phone, mobile applications, in a sense, take the form of independent “modules” that do not need direct access to the underlying hardware features.</p><p>Instead, should an app require access to the device’s camera, it requests permission to use the OS’s pre-packaged module that grants access rights to third-party applications. This means the mobile team does not need to re-implement all the code and logic around using a device’s camera; it merely requests this functionality from the OS.<br>This, in many ways, is the same way Particl modules function. Each of them provides a functionality that dApp developers can simply query access to.</p><p>Not only is this a critical step in making Particl more open to outside contributors, but it’s also making the entire ecosystem much more resilient against outside interference by decentralizing and making more independent the way dApps are developed and maintained.</p><h3 id=\"deploying-particl-s-key-modules\">Deploying Particl’s Key Modules</h3><p>Among the wide variety of functionality and services that can be isolated into modules, here are a few of which the team will initially focus on as we embark on this new development phase.</p><ul><li><strong>Blockchain node modules</strong> (to integrate other cryptocurrencies)</li><li><strong>Payment module</strong> (to provide payment solutions)</li><li><strong>Market-related modules</strong> (to provide out-of-the-box eCommerce services)</li><li><strong>Two-party escrow system</strong> (to provide trade assurance)</li><li><strong>SMSG — End-to-end encrypted chat</strong> (for safe communications)</li><li><strong>SMSG — Decentralized storage</strong> (to store data online)</li><li><strong>SMSG — Decentralized hosting</strong> (to host web content and dApps)</li><li><strong>SMSG — Controller module</strong> (to process, interpret, and interact with SMSG messages (back-end services for developers))</li><li><strong>Swap modules</strong> (including BasicSwap, to swap cryptocurrencies)</li><li><strong>Staking module</strong> (to integrate PART staking capabilities)</li><li><strong>Third-party integrations</strong> (to integrate extraneous protocols such as Tor, PGP, i2p, IPFS, other mixnets, etc.)</li></ul><p>Note that other functionalities, features, or entire dApps can and will be isolated into modules as well. The above list merely showcases the most critical ones but doesn’t go over all possibilities.</p><h3 id=\"how-does-this-benefit-particl\">How Does This Benefit Particl?</h3><p>The ecosystem's modular evolution introduces many benefits critical to the success of Particl. Let's go over the main ones.</p><h4 id=\"makes-development-easier-and-increases-production-pace\">Makes development easier and increases production pace</h4><p>With a proper SDK toolkit at the disposal of developers, it becomes easier to develop an application when not having to deal with various setup and maintenance burdens.</p><p>Currently, each new dApp added to Particl Desktop is built directly into the client, meaning that each app needs to consider how the entire desktop client fits together, as well as how the current dApp impacts each of the other built-in apps.</p><p>For example, the marketplace messaging system that is currently built into the marketplace needs to be aware of how the whole dApp handles SMSG messages simply because it itself requires messaging capabilities. Therefore, any change to how Particl Marketplace handles messages requires changes to be made to the messaging system implementation as well, essentially doubling the amount of work required and making any new feature or implementation a permanent development burden to maintain.</p><p>This type of situation can be avoided by isolating this messaging feature into an independent and standardized module, allowing dApp developers to simply request an out-of-the-box chat functionality from the appropriate module instead of creating it from scratch.</p><p>This will significantly speed up the development of dApps and facilitate community contributions by making it easier, faster, and more straightforward to build dApps that ensure users’ rights are respected.</p><h4 id=\"make-dapp-maintenance-independent-from-the-particl-team-or-platform-they-re-hosted-on\">Make dApp maintenance independent from the Particl team or platform they’re hosted on</h4><p>Adding to the benefit mentioned above, the introduction of modules makes dApps entirely independent from the Particl team and the access gateway they're made available on.</p><p>Let's use the popular Steam gaming platform as an example to better illustrate what this means.</p><p>Steam was originally built to distribute Valve Software's games and updates to those games, after which it grew to become a general gaming \"launcher\" platform. As a result, it is today one of the most well-known means of obtaining games online.</p><p>When a game installed on Steam requires an update, it can be updated on its own, by the game development team, without requiring a Steam client-wide update. If the Steam team needed to maintain, fix, and push updates for each game they host on their ecosystem, it would quickly become an unscalable and highly impractical situation.</p><p>That is, however, how the Particl ecosystem currently functions. Once a dApp or new feature is settled on and integrated into the current Particl Desktop client, the burden of maintenance falls on the Particl development team. In addition, the original author of a dApp or feature, which may or may not be a Particl team member, might no longer wish or be able to maintain the code, thus transferring all these responsibilities to the Particl team for all future Particl Desktop releases.</p><p>And then, even if the dApp author keeps on contributing, knowledge of all future planned updates and changes to any portion of the Particl code is required by the author as it may affect their own dApp and require adaptation coding work.</p><p>Ultimately, this causes Particl Desktop releases to become increasingly dependent on timely contributions from said authors, leading to delays and inefficiencies. In the context of a wide and open dApp ecosystem, it is an unmaintainable situation.</p><p>The new modular architecture eliminates these issues and enables independent dApp developers to develop and maintain their products separately from the Particl team or Particl Desktop releases schedules and according to their own terms.</p><h4 id=\"faster-rollout-for-updates-new-features-and-bug-fixes\">Faster rollout for updates, new features, and bug fixes</h4><p>Right now, a bug fix to a dApp such as Particl Marketplace requires an entire Particl Desktop client release. A bug fix under the new scenario can be rolled out as soon as the author feels it's ready, without needing to consider an entire client update or involve the Particl team.</p><p>That's because the bug fix, in that case, would be pushed not to the desktop client itself but to the precise module affected by it, which then gets automatically updated on all dApps that use that module.</p><p>This, again, takes the responsibility off of the Particl team and lets it focus on the greater vision while contributors can promptly push their own fixes and manage their apps without relying on the team's actions.</p><p>For example, if a dApp uses a Tor module to route traffic through Tor, it wouldn't need an ecosystem-wide update whenever Tor pushes an update to their network. The update would instead be automatically applied to the module, ensuring that all Particl dApps with Tor functionality are kept up-to-date with security fixes.</p><p>This is a major stride towards better dApp security and more timely updates.</p><h3 id=\"in-summary\">In Summary</h3><p>Particl's new modular architecture opens many doors, essentially transforming the Particl ecosystem into a privacy-conscious and decentralized foundation for the new internet.</p><p>This new approach can be broadly summarized in three key points:</p><ol><li>The Particl ecosystem isn't any more a single big block of code; instead, it is separated into independent modules, making it more open, accessible, and developer-friendly than ever. It is also more resilient against central points of failure.</li><li>Instead of requiring developers to re-implement all key functionalities, dApps can simply request it to a particular module without building everything or integrating everything from scratch, much like the example of mobile OSes and mobile apps we've highlighted just above.</li><li>DApps become entirely independent from the Particl team, the wider Particl ecosystem, and the access gateway on which they're made available.</li></ol><h2 id=\"3-access-gateways-and-dapp-accessibility\">3. Access Gateways and dApp Accessibility</h2><p>One of the most important goals of this new development cycle is to improve accessibility to Particl dApps so that they can be used by almost anyone, without complicated steps, and to stop relying exclusively on a single desktop application for all purposes. <strong>This third fold of Particl's strategic plan is a critical aspect in getting any sort of organic and sustained adoption.</strong></p><p>As such, Particl's new modular approach makes it much easier to integrate modules, or whole dApps, into different access gateways such as web or mobile frameworks or even into third-party applications.</p><h3 id=\"web-access\">Web Access</h3><p>However, <a href=\"https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/\">as we’ve explored</a>, hosting dApps on top of the current and centralized web environment, while highly convenient, carries critical vulnerabilities and heavy downsides. With these challenges in mind, we plan on enabling alternative web hosting solutions, notably through SMSG 2.0’s content hosting capabilities.</p><p>Indeed, as we’ve mentioned earlier, SMSG 2.0 is scheduled to evolve from a distributed messaging protocol into a full-blown internet protocol more akin to something like Tor or i2p, eventually enabling dApps to be hosted on it and accessed from web browsers.</p><p>Of course, with Particl becoming so flexible and open to community contributors, we fully expect more traditional web and mobile versions of Particl dApps (i.e., Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap DEX, two-party escrow system, end-to-end encrypted messenger) to be made available. The team also intends to deliver such solutions to provide more options to the end-user.</p><h3 id=\"a-new-modular-particl-desktop\">A New Modular Particl Desktop</h3><p>Just like the rest of the ecosystem, Particl Desktop will become a modular client, enabling the end-user to add, remove, and configure dApps as they wish. This promotes openness and choice and ensures that users do not need to install every Particl dApp, some of which they may have no use for.</p><p>For example, one might not care about the Governance dApp, but the user is still currently forced to have it available because it is hard-coded into Particl Desktop. Alternatively, a user may not want to run the marketplace at all. Still, they are required to do so and, by the same process, spend computer resources decrypting all SMSG messages related to it (i.e., listings).</p><p>With a modular approach, the user could simply remove the marketplace dApp from their Particl Desktop application or simply never have to install it in the first place.</p><h4 id=\"dapp-store\">DApp Store</h4><p>To promote Particl’s vision, a “dApp store” may be made available, on which a list of official or recommended dApps would be featured with the ability for independent contributors to push their own dApps and modules to it.</p><p>Of course, in the spirit of openness and decentralization, the dApp store will be a convenient but optional platform for interacting with those dApps. As open-source applications, it will be possible to download or install them via other ways as well.</p><h2 id=\"4-currency-and-protocol-agnosticism\">4. Currency and Protocol Agnosticism</h2><p>To further promote openness and become an all-inclusive foundation for the internet of tomorrow, Particl is fully embracing the concept of agnosticism by ensuring its ecosystem can remain compatible with other cryptocurrencies and protocols. <strong>This is the fourth fold of Particl's strategic plan</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"currency-agnosticism\">Currency Agnosticism</h3><p>As part of the range of modules available to developers will be cryptocurrency-specific modules that makes it possible for certain dApps to support other cryptocurrencies (i.e., Bitcoin).</p><p>Although not all cryptocurrencies may be able to use all Particl features and services (some of them requiring very specific functionality unique to the PART privacy coin), this will extend the ecosystem's reach by welcoming other cryptocurrency communities and providing them with more utility for their coin.</p><p>When a cryptocurrency cannot use a specific Particl functionality, a swap module, like BasicSwap DEX, for example, can be added to let the end-user swap their coins for PART or even have the dApp execute that action automatically as a background process. This will allow holders of other cryptocurrencies to seamlessly benefit from Particl-specific features without negatively affecting the user experience.</p><p>In the exact same way, a fiat gateway module, such as a service offering credit card purchases of cryptocurrencies, can be added to the ecosystem and leveraged by dApp developers to provide added functionality to their products — further bridging the gap between the legacy payment industry and the world of cryptocurrencies.</p><h3 id=\"protocol-agnosticism\">Protocol Agnosticism</h3><p>Because dApps are developed using modules, it is possible to leverage protocols that are not native to the Particl ecosystem to build some of their features.</p><p>For example, SMSG provides chat functionality to dApps through its messaging module. But a developer could decide to instead integrate a different messaging protocol, like <a href=\"https://matrix.org/\">matrix</a>, which powers the <a href=\"https://riot.im/app/#/room/#particl-project:matrix.org\">Element Messenger</a>. This would still grant the dApp with messaging capabilities, but a different protocol would power it.</p><p>There are three main reasons behind this approach. For one, distinct protocols have different pros and cons. Some use cases may get more out of a particular protocol, while a different dApp may find it more efficient to use another. This gives more flexibility to developers and lets them work with what they think is in the best interest of their users.</p><p>Secondly, it makes Particl dApps more resistant to the test of time. As technology evolves very rapidly, it is not rare to see major protocol innovations appear. And because it's likely that, over time, better versions of protocols used to build dApps become available, developers require the ability to seamlessly swap protocols to keep up with the evolutionary curve. In other words, it makes it significantly easier to keep Particl dApps up-to-date with the most recent progress in the space, ensuring the user gets the most of what is possible at the time that they use a dApp.</p><p>Finally, it also makes dApps more secure and resilient against attacks. For example, if a vulnerability is found in the protocol powering a certain dApp, its developer can simply swap the faulty module for an unaffected alternative. This lets developers act quickly when there are security issues while preserving the integrity of the other components of a dApp.</p><h2 id=\"new-particl-dapps-are-coming-around\">New Particl dApps are Coming Around</h2><p>Particl’s new modular approach opens up a ton of opportunities. Not only does it enable more efficient and secure dApps, but it also completely opens up its development process to the world.</p><p>Moreover, with <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io\">Particl’s CCS platform</a>, anyone can publish proposals seeking to fund the development of various dApps, creating a fully self-perpetuating economy and environment. And we know the Particl community is not short of ideas! Indeed, once the modular architecture is deployed, we fully expect to see a rapid increase in the number of community-led initiatives.</p><p>That being said, the Particl team will, of course, be working on its own dApps not only to showcase what is possible with the improved Particl infrastructure but also to lead the way towards a better, fairer digital world for all.</p><p>Here are dApps or services the Particl team will work on once different components of the modular infrastructure go live.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center full light-one\" id=\"btn-add_01\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"col\">\n    <div class=\"tabs\">\n      <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">New version of the marketplace</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            This development cycle changes the back-end of the ecosystem so much that a completely new version of the marketplace will need to be deployed.\n            <br><br>\n            More flexible, fast, and agnostic than the current version, it will offer the same functionality but in a much more accessible way. In addition, the marketplace will be designed so that its part, or its whole, can be integrated into different access gateways like a website, mobile application, or third-party integrations; all are cross-compatible.\n            <br><br>\n            Also, because of its cleaner, modular codebase, any future development, such as the development of new features, will be dramatically sped up from the current typical pace.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n        \n      <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck3\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck3\">Mobile version of the marketplace</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            In just a few years, mobile devices are expected to be the preferential way people shop online.

Countless times, we’re sure.\n            <br><br>\n            The reality, however, is different for sellers who, for the vast majority, manage their business from desktop or laptop computers.\n            <br><br>\n            That is why one of Particl’s first dApps will be a buyer-focused mobile version of Particl Marketplace. This dApp will use the new modular approach of the ecosystem and showcase the use of a mobile access gateway into which Particl dApps will then be able to be integrated.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck4\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck4\">Privacy-first messenger app</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Think Signal or Telegram, but 100% decentralized and open-source. A privacy-first messenger application could be deployed relatively easily on mobile and desktop environments. Moreover, because it only requires SMSG modules, such a dApp could likely become available before even the release of the new version of the marketplace, as the latter requires more modules to be put together in order to function and carries a higher level of complexity. After all, because SMSG’s messaging capability is expected to be used heavily in the future, it only makes sense to isolate it into a proper standalone app or module early on.\n            <br><br>\n            Besides, it will serve as an excellent showcase for the new SMSG 2.0 network and mobile access gateways.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck5\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck5\">Standalone escrow app and integrations</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            As a way to demonstrate the integrability of modules, the Particl team may work on a showcase in which a two-party escrow option becomes available on a new mobile wallet.\n            <br><br>\n            As we’ve discussed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://particl.news/an-overview-of-particls-two-party-escrow/\">here</a>, Particl’s novel two-party escrow system has a wide range of use cases, all the way to in-person trade, and enabling this type of escrow outside of Particl Marketplace will allow us to tap into and reach more of these possibilities.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck6\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck6\">Third-party integrations</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            The modular approach's integration potential works in two ways: it, for one, allows Particl dApps to be integrated into existing eCommerce platforms (i.e., a WooCommerce payment plugin with two-party escrow contracts), but it also allows third-party services to be integrated right into dApps as modules (i.e., a third-party inventory management system that a seller may be using on other platforms).\n            <br><br>\n            As such, you can expect, over time, a wide range of integrations to be made available on the Particl dApp store or other popular platforms — in the form of a WooCommerce plugin, for example.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n    </div><!-- tabs close-->\n  </div><!-- col close-->\n</div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h1 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h1><p>This new major development cycle is expected to last from 12 to 18 months, with the current team size, and start right after the release of <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-3-what-to-expect/\">Particl Desktop 3.3</a>.</p><p>However, the team has recently actively been looking for external funding and pitching to various investors.

The new versions of these products will be built in parallel to existing Particl dApps. Therefore, there will be no changes to the availability of current dApps while the improvements to the ecosystem are being made, and they will still be maintained as required. Only when new versions of these applications are launched will the legacy versions be deprecated.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n        \n      <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck3\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck3\">Does adding the ability to use other coins within the ecosystem render PART useless?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Absolutely not. PART is and will remain a critical component of the Particl ecosystem. It is what powers its transactional privacy and is a requirement for interacting with some of the more complex Particl smart contracts. Remember, what makes PART unique is that it possesses both privacy and flexibility, a key aspect to many functions provided by Particl dApps that other cryptocurrencies cannot replicate.\n            <br><br>\n            For example, while an application built using Particl modules may allow for Monero payments, Monero still cannot be used with something like Particl’s two-party escrow system. In that case, the dApp’s developer may instead use a payment module, then a swap module to allow users to easily swap their Monero for PART. This would let Monero users benefit from some of the more advanced marketplace functions, such as its escrow capabilities, while still interacting with it using Monero even if the payment ultimately settles in PART.\n            <br><br>\n            On the other hand, if a dApp requires simple payments to be made (for instance, sending Monero through messages sent via the upcoming messenger application), then it may be possible to use Monero directly without having to route the payment through PART.\n            <br><br>\n            We aim to build an open and free ecosystem for all; forcing people to use a single cryptocurrency when they could be using others goes against that ethos. By opening up the Particl ecosystem to the wider cryptocurrency community, we significantly increase the range of potential Particl dApps users and successfully bring new levels of liberty and privacy to more people. After all, this is Particl’s fundamental mission. \n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck4\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck4\">Doesn’t this evolutionary process open up the door for more centralization?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Because Particl is about to become much more open-ended and easy to work with, businesses or independent developers may be interested in coding dApps that are more centralized than, for example, the current version of Particl Marketplace (which makes no compromise whatsoever on that end). But at the end of the day, it becomes up to the user to use that \"more centralized\" service or a more open/decentralized/private service instead, basing their decision on what's best for them.\n            <br><br>\n            Nonetheless, even when accounting for future, more centralized applications, their inclusion in the ecosystem brings considerable benefits at the level of decentralization.\n            <br><br>\n            First, it decentralizes the development process of the entire ecosystem by giving easy-to-use tools for developers and business people all around the world. No more will the platform's growth entirely depend on the core Particl development team — the new open and modular infrastructure will make it very easy for anyone to work on their own vision of Particl. This also radically improves the resilience of the network as a whole.\n            <br><br>\n            Secondly, combined with the CCS crowdfunding platform, this will positively impact the amount and efficiency of contributions from the community as it will be possible to self-fund great ideas using the treasury system, then realize them using easy-to-use dev tools. Particl is blessed to have a strong community that often comes up with great and revolutionary ideas, which we, the Particl team, are excited about but unable to give the time they would require (because of the current maintenance requirements and our own roadmap). This new evolutionary leap forward fixes that obstacle.\n            <br><br>\n            The evolution of Particl's architecture to a modular one changes everything and gives all the power to users. Anyone with a great idea or who wishes to create a certain dApp on Particl can easily submit a proposal, get it approved by the community for funding, and either code it themselves or find a third-party developer to do it. Using modules, bringing an idea to life will be possible for almost any Web3 developer.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck6\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck6\">Does Particl have the funds required to make all of that happen?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Although the current price of PART presents a challenge in terms of growth for the team, we’ve got enough funds to last for the duration of this development cycle at the current pace.\n            <br><br>\n            However, we've recently been actively working on raising funds from external investors to complement the monthly claims from the network's treasury and accelerate our progress. Although we cannot reveal more information about it at this time, we will publish our pitch deck and Particl's new whitepaper, which we're both using to pitch, shortly into the future.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck7\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck7\">How does the team expects to deliver on this with its small size? Any plans to grow the team?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            An aspect of this development cycle's strategy is to grow the development team to help on the various components and dApp projects. But, of course, this is highly contingent on the amount of funding at our disposal, whether through better PART prices or external funding. This is why we've recently made raising funds one of our top priorities.\n            <br><br>\n            Besides, one of the critical goal of this cycle is to further decentralize the development process to allow more independent developers to contribute to the ecosystem on their own. This will reduce the burden on the Particl team and allow for more people to help the network grow. \n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck8\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck8\">What about marketing in all of this?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Again, the scale and timing of marketing efforts is equally contingent on the amount of funding at the team's disposal. And although this evolutionary leap forward is mostly development-focused — as it deals with foundational work — we still have different marketing and communications initiatives ready to deploy as soon as financial capabilities permit.\n            <br><br>\n            But, at its core, this \"foundational phase\" is a necessary step that will result in much more accessible, user-friendly, and convenient dApps — a critical factor that affects both user acquisition and retention, and also leads to better marketing ROI. For this reason, it is, in many ways, a long-term play towards future marketing and outreach efforts, ensuring Particl dApps live up to the hype of the marketing efforts that will promote them.\n            <br><br>\n            In addition, this entire phase expands on the ecosystem’s use cases and target audiences — essentially vastly increasing our pool of potential users. The team fully expects to capitalize on this opportunity by carefully and gradually increasing marketing and outreach efforts as we progress through this cycle’s critical milestones, notably as we incrementally release new products and major updates.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck9\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck9\">Does that mean that dApps like Particl Marketplace could be integrated into other cryptocurrency wallets?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Yes. Even further, it means that any Particl dApp can be ‘white labeled’ or re-interpreted by anyone. A cryptocurrency project could, for example, integrate Particl Marketplace into its own coin wallet, take out the escrow, and force payments to be made exclusively using their cryptocurrency. Then, to pay for the SMSG anti-spam fee, they could simply build a system around a swap module like BasicSwap to automatically and seamlessly exchange their native coin to PART to pay for listing fees. \n            <br><br>\n            In fact, there is great potential for these sorts of projects. Third-party integrations and white-labeled solutions can help more communities thrive by reaping the network's liberty and privacy benefits. It can also generate revenue for the project in a way that's mutually beneficial for all parties involved. This will be an important aspect of Particl's adoption and go-to-market strategy as we incrementally release new products.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck10\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck10\">Will the current version of SMSG be deprecated?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            No, SMSG 1.0 is not planned to be deprecated for the moment, even when SMSG 2.0 comes out.

However, this time estimate will likely improve as we gradually grow the team and fill various key positions following a successful funding round. However, it's important to note that these months spent working through this development phase will be far from uneventful as we have planned several incremental releases. Therefore, 12 to 18 months is the estimate for the entire process to be over, but in the meantime, you can expect different exciting releases to keep things very interesting.\n            <br><br>\n            For example, while it may take longer to release the new version of Particl Marketplace, largely due to its complexity and the sheer number of modules it uses, SMSG 2.0 or the privacy-first messenger app might launch before that time. That’s because the new version of Particl Marketplace uses many different modules which, individually, will be ready at different points in time. \n            <br><br>\n            In the case of the privacy-first messenger app, it is, at its core, a much simpler dApp. Because it uses fewer modules than Particl Marketplace, it would be much easier and quicker to deploy. And since the messaging function of SMSG is expected to be leveraged by many future dApp, it only makes sense to deploy it early on into the process.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n    </div><!-- tabs close-->\n  </div><!-- col close-->\n</div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html-->","url":"http://localhost:2368/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"d25c43aa-687c-423a-8918-0d276a3c8800","codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"62e1e75c910c1554f0dd5b4e","reading_time":30,"send_email_when_published":false,"email_subject":null,"childHtmlRehype":{"html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"/glink/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 1000w, /glink/size/w1600/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 1600w, /glink/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"></figure><p>If you’ve been following Particl closely, then you may have heard whispers that the Particl team is gearing up to undertake a new major development cycle.

We need to reassert and safeguard our rights to an open, free, and private web environment, as it was originally intended to be, and be the change we want to see in this world!</p><p>Whereas certain governments, corporations, or other types of organizations continue to elevate their level of control and power using the current web infrastructure, there is a growing need to stop fighting on their own turf and, instead, pioneer the digital world of tomorrow in which the rights and freedoms of each individual are guaranteed.</p><p>When accessible and easy to use, disruptive technology — as is the case with Particl’s privacy-first dApps — becomes both a shield and a weapon, protecting us from digital abuse but also striking back by allowing people to thrive without interference from the current centralized web infrastructure.</p><h3 id=\"the-shortcomings-of-web3\">The Shortcomings of Web3</h3><p>That is, in essence, what Web3 promised to accomplish: a more open, independent, and free internet for all. Unfortunately, <a href=\"https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/\">as we’ve come to discover</a>, what Web3 promises and what it currently delivers diverges on many fronts. If you dive into its present state, you can see that it’s much more centralized than it first appears — relying, in major parts, on traditional “big tech” infrastructure — and that it turns out to be a near disaster in terms of privacy and decentralization.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Web3 Exposed!

On the latter, only a few parties can access your financial information. That would typically be your bank or the payment processor you’re using, government organizations, and their partners. With Web3 services, your financial data, while pseudonymous, is permanently and publicly stored for the whole world to see. Anyone curious enough can simply look for the entirety of your information in public records.</p><p>Case in point, here are <a href=\"https://debank.com/profile/0xb432863b3857f1cd9d78f5856a8d20693a8bc1a0?chain=eth\">the financial assets of a random public Ethereum user</a>, <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xb432863b3857f1cd9d78f5856a8d20693a8bc1a0\">their detailed financial history</a>, <a href=\"https://debank.com/profile/0xb432863b3857f1cd9d78f5856a8d20693a8bc1a0/nft?chain=eth\">as well as all the NFTs they own</a>. And while we’ve simply picked a random user that had just traded on Uniswap at the time of this writing, the totality of their financial information is permanently out in the open. Anyone that then sends payments to that address is able to track, down to the cent, the totality of its owner’s past, present, and future financial activities; a terrible foundation from which to build the “economy or internet of tomorrow”.</p><p>What’s more, not all Web3 apps are as decentralized and open as they claim, such as we’ve seen with <a href=\"https://medium.com/coinmonks/as-metamask-and-opensea-abide-by-us-sanctions-the-russian-ban-is-in-the-spotlight-67611df121f8\">Infura, MetaMask</a>, and various other dApps that use their services like the not-so-decentralized <a href=\"https://cryptobriefing.com/metamask-opensea-blocks-expose-centralization-in-web3/\">NFT marketplace OpenSea</a>.</p><p>With so many similar examples recently in mind, It’s difficult to see Web3 succeed on its stated mission when its biggest and most popular apps end up not living up to their promises at best and, at worst, significantly eroding online privacy and security compared to even Web2.</p><p>In reality, the main problem doesn’t stem from Web3 as a basic concept but rather from its poor implementation of the principles required to fulfill its mission; a lack of vision from some of Web3’s leaders, or in other cases, the sheer pursuit of fast profit, leads to cutting corners and sacrificing the most critical foundations of Web3.</p><p>Indeed, it is deluded to think fighting the centralization of powers on the web can be done by building apps and services with less privacy than on traditional web infrastructure or hosting them on said outdated infrastructure. Yet, it unfortunately appears to be the direction that Web3 is headed towards.</p><p><strong><em>Particl’s next development cycle is all about steering this ship in the right direction.</em></strong></p><h3 id=\"building-the-right-foundation\">Building the Right Foundation</h3><p>Particl’s new development cycle is about steering Web3 in the right direction by granting it <strong>a truly independent and resilient foundation on which privacy-first decentralized applications can be deployed</strong>.</p><p>By leveraging the firepower of an <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/electric-capital/developer-reports/master/dev_report_2021_updated_012622.pdf\">ever-growing community of Web3 pioneers</a> and giving them tools that follow a privacy-first approach, a decentralized and open-source alternative to the traditional web infrastructure can be built to fight back against the centralization of powers. It is up to all of us to create a parallel and independent environment that puts individuals at the center — simultaneously armed and shielded with privacy-first dApps — and liberates them from the ever-tightening noose that is the centralization of powers online and all the consequences it brings forth.</p><h2 id=\"announcing-particl-s-new-major-development-cycle\">Announcing Particl’s New Major Development Cycle</h2><p>In a nutshell, Particl’s new development cycle focuses on expanding the ecosystem’s strengths and endowing it with a new, modular infrastructure, ultimately building a solid foundation on which to easily build and use privacy-first dApps.</p><p>Before we go into further details on this new development cycle, it’s important to understand the reasoning behind the journey ahead by first being aware of Particl’s strengths and what makes it unique.</p><h3 id=\"what-makes-particl-unique\">What Makes Particl Unique?</h3><p>Particl is a revolutionary and powerful ecosystem like none other thanks to a unique combination of two core components: Particl Blockchain and the SecureMessaging network (SMSG).</p><h4 id=\"particl-blockchain\">Particl Blockchain </h4><p>The Particl Blockchain is a unique and powerful blockchain that contains both various privacy-preserving features (CT, RingCT, stealth addresses, Taproot, etc) as well as a high level of flexibility.</p><p>While its native cryptocurrency, PART, <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd/\">allows for untraceable payments to be made (privacy coin)</a>, the blockchain infrastructure allows for the creation of complex, decentralized, and privacy-first applications through the use of smart contracts and scriptless scripts (off-chain, private, and scalable smart contracts). This unique convergence of privacy capabilities and application flexibility allows for the Particl Blockchain to carve a niche of its own within the blockchain industry with an uncompromising focus on “privacy-first dApps”, such as Particl <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Marketplace</a> or <a href=\"https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/\">BasicSwap DEX</a>.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> Although the concept of smart contracts is well known to most people within the cryptocurrency community, scriptless scripts, on the other hand, tend to be less widely known. You can learn more about them </em><a href=\"https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex#scriptless-scripts\"><em>here</em></a><em> or by reading this </em><a href=\"https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/introduction-to-scriptless-scripts\"><em>in-depth guide</em></a><em>.</em></blockquote><h4 id=\"securemessaging-network-smsg-\">SecureMessaging Network (SMSG)</h4><p>SecureMessaging (SMSG) is a P2P mixnet that allows peers to communicate encrypted data with other peers or applications without the need for third parties or middlemen. Inspired by the<a href=\"https://www.whonix.org/wiki/BitMessage\"> BitMessage protocol</a>, it stores and transfers data across nodes in a privacy-preserving manner, encrypted from end to end (E2EE).</p><p>In other words, SMSG is a decentralized messaging layer that both dApps and users themselves can use. Its usage enables the creation and deployment of much more complex decentralized applications than what can be done using smart contracts exclusively. You can read more on the SMSG network <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\">here</a>.</p><h2 id=\"particl-s-four-pillars-for-the-new-digital-world\">Particl's Four Pillars for the New Digital World</h2><p>Particl's unique combination of a private and flexible blockchain with a decentralized mixnet makes possible the creation of advanced privacy-first dApps that protect the rights and liberties of its users.</p><p>Compared to the majority of Web3, Particl dApps are a major improvement in terms of the values they are committed to. We must capitalize on that potential for the good of not only the project but also the well-being of the internet and society as a whole.</p><p>The strategic plan to make all of this happen is fourfold:</p><ol><li><a href=\"#1-smsg-2-0-a-decentralized-and-private-internet-protocol\">Deploy a new, more powerful mixnet to expand on the network's capabilities (already well in its conceptualization phase, tentatively named \"SMSG 2.0\")</a></li><li><a href=\"#2-giving-particl-a-modular-dimension\">Transform Particl into a modular and development-friendly infrastructure</a></li><li><a href=\"#3-a-greater-focus-on-access-gateways-and-dapp-accessibility\">Deploy new \"access gateways\" (i.e., web, mobile, and SMSG frameworks) to host decentralized applications and interact with them</a></li><li><a href=\"#4-a-commitment-to-agnosticism\">Commit as much as possible to an agnostic philosophy</a></li></ol><p>Let's explore these four central aspects of Particl's new strategic plan in more detail.</p><h2 id=\"1-smsg-2-0-a-decentralized-and-private-internet-protocol\">1. SMSG 2.0 — A Decentralized and Private Internet Protocol</h2><p>A big reason why Particl dApps are so unique is due to them leveraging the <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\">data transmission and storage capabilities of the SMSG network</a>, which runs in parallel but independently to Particl Blockchain nodes. This makes possible more advanced features and functionality than traditional smart-contract dApps, as is the case with both the Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap DEX dApps.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">The SMSG Network — Enabling Dapps With True Privacy</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Learn more about what makes Particl decentralized applications truly special and private!</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://particl.news/icons/icon-512x512.png\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Particl News</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">cryptoguard</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://particl.news/static/6b2dad3b47be647f145e4bbace6c1950/smsg_network-medium-2.jpg\"></div></a></figure><p>But while the SMSG network offers pristine privacy and a very secure, trustless way to communicate data between peers, it is not scalable enough to support massive levels of simultaneous usage.</p><p>Additionally, it only allows for data transmission and temporary storage, making it more akin to a messaging protocol rather than a fully-fledged internet infrastructure.</p><p>And so, the <strong>first fold of Particl’s new strategic plan is to re-imagine SMSG to make it more scalable and allow for even more advanced functionality</strong> — essentially doubling down on its strengths and expanding on its use-cases.</p><h3 id=\"an-open-and-decentralized-web-architecture\">An Open and Decentralized Web Architecture</h3><p>To get groundbreaking results, you sometimes need to think outside the box. It is true that the current version of SMSG provides the privacy and capabilities we need to build privacy-first dApps — however, it is limited in terms of how much usage the network can sustain. Furthermore, updating its current code implementation would only result in marginal scalability improvements due to the way it is built.</p><p>That’s why a completely new version of SMSG, built from scratch and with the mission of serving as the foundation for the new internet, is required.</p><h4 id=\"distributed-web-content-and-dapp-hosting\">Distributed Web Content and dApp Hosting</h4><p>A critical new functionality SMSG requires is the ability to not only store data but also <strong>host and allow for direct interaction with web content and dApps</strong> — entirely independently from any traditional web infrastructure (the “world wide web”).</p><p>To put it another way, this major functionality update amounts to transforming SMSG from a messaging network into a fully decentralized, independent, free, and privacy-first internet protocol that’s open to all, without restrictions.</p><p>With dApps and web content hosted on — and accessible from — this distributed network, it provides a viable alternative for people to opt out completely of our current internet infrastructure, which has grown corrupted and toxic over the past few decades. Plus, content and dApps hosted on it become entirely censorship-proof as the decentralized nature of this network shields them from any interference from central parties.</p><h4 id=\"near-infinite-scalability\">Near-Infinite Scalability</h4><p>To be a viable option to boldly act as the foundation for the “internet of tomorrow”, SMSG 2.0 requires a linear model of scalability, essentially increasing as more people (nodes) join the network (i.e., by using Particl dApps).</p><p>This feat is accomplished by radically changing how data travels between nodes. Whereas the current implementation of SMSG broadcasts all messages to all nodes — with only those with the proper private keys being able to decrypt the messages’ content — <strong>SMSG 2.0 distributes that signal in a more structured fashion, with each node routing a (configurable) amount of traffic</strong>.</p><p>This effectively increases SMSG’s throughput as more nodes become available. And as more people use Particl dApps, more nodes become available, thus ensuring a sufficient count to provide the level of scalability any substantial increase in adoption requires.</p><h2 id=\"2-a-new-modular-architecture\">2. A New Modular Architecture</h2><p><strong>The second fold of Particl’s strategic plan is to give the ecosystem a new modular dimension.</strong> Because to act as the pillar of the new internet requires a significant level of community involvement — notably in expanding the pool of pioneers working on new, exciting decentralized applications and services — we’ve got to ensure that the ecosystem is developer-friendly, coding efficient, and that its unique functionality can easily extend into the real world.</p><h3 id=\"particl-s-current-infrastructure\">Particl’s Current Infrastructure</h3><p>Unfortunately, that is not the case currently. Particl’s infrastructure is not as open as it could be, and the majority of its development hinges almost exclusively on the Particl team.</p><p>Even in the event that an outside contributor would like to contribute work by building a dApp or distributed service of their own, they require full cooperation with the Particl team to be added to Particl Desktop, the project’s main access gateway, and adds up to the team’s responsibilities as it will need to keep the new dApp in line with any and all future desktop or core updates.</p><p>In reality, Particl’s current architecture is monolithic in nature, which isn’t as much of a problem if the project focuses solely on a single dApp — Particl Marketplace — but highly counterproductive and restrictive in the context of Particl as the foundation for a better internet protocol.</p><h4 id=\"cooperation-requirements-for-dapp-maintenance-and-integration\">Cooperation Requirements for dApp Maintenance and Integration</h4><p>One of Particl's current main issues is its architecture is very monolithic. Even though the Particl Marketplace may look like an application independent from Particl Desktop, it is not.</p><p>Indeed, the code for Particl Marketplace is deeply intertwined with the Particl Desktop's codebase, essentially requiring the latter to access and use it. In that sense, Particl Marketplace is more of a Particl Desktop feature rather than a standalone dApp.</p><p>Particl's new upcoming modular architecture remedies that by allowing for a much greater level of independence between dApps (Particl Marketplace) and access gateways (Particl Desktop).</p><h4 id=\"enabling-the-ability-to-re-use-functionality-already-implemented-on-other-dapps\">Enabling the Ability to Re-Use Functionality Already Implemented on Other DApps</h4><p>Not only do outside contributors currently require the full cooperation of the Particl team to maintain and deploy their dApps, or even integrate Particl dApps into their own products, but they also need to re-implement all key functionalities, even if already provided by other dApps, from scratch.</p><p>Let’s take, for example, the hypothetical scenario where a community-funded developer wishes to work on an end-to-end encrypted messenger dApp using the messaging capabilities offered by the SMSG network. Naturally, one would instantly take a look at Particl Marketplace and reuse its implementation of SMSG’s messaging functionality (as it is used to allow sellers and buyers to communicate with each other). However, that is not exactly possible.</p><p>Because even the most basic and key capabilities of the network must be hard-coded into Particl dApps, it is impossible to leverage implementations of desired functionalities in other Dapps. Every single function instead requires to be re-implemented all over again.</p><p>Again, this is not a deal breaker for a project that focuses exclusively on one dApp. But for an ecosystem that aspires to become a foundation for a new, parallel internet, this must change to become more open and scalable.</p><h3 id=\"introducing-particl-modules-and-the-developer-sdk\">Introducing Particl Modules and the Developer SDK</h3><p>To remedy that situation, the Particl team will adopt a modular approach from now on — isolating every core feature, functionality, and component of its ecosystem into a set of developer-friendly <strong>modules</strong> that can be added, removed, configured, and managed into a dApp (i.e., Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap DEX) or an access gateway (i.e., Particl Desktop, third-party wallet) independently.</p><h4 id=\"modules\">Modules</h4><p>In this context, a<strong> module </strong>refers to a<strong> readily-available packaged set of code, libraries, and logic that provides a functionality, feature, or service to an external environment (i.e., a dApp)</strong>. They grant dApps critical and/or common Particl features, allowing contributors to focus on what makes their own dApp unique rather than spending time reimplementing fundamental or complex functions.</p><h4 id=\"developer-sdk\">Developer SDK</h4><p>Particl’s upcoming SDK will empower developers to build various dApps using a <strong>standardized set of development tools and documentation</strong>. Not only does the SDK improve dApp security by ensuring their critical components are safely implemented, but it also makes it easy and straightforward for developers to build privacy-first dApps. If the modules are the building blocks that developers use to build dApps, the SDK is the glue that binds them together in a structured and standardized way.</p><h4 id=\"access-gateways\">Access gateways</h4><p>This term refers to any platform, app, or framework from which a dApp is accessed and used. This can be a desktop client like Particl Desktop, a web or SMSG page, a mobile application, or even a third-party integration.</p><h3 id=\"the-mobile-apps-vs-particl-dapps-comparison\">The Mobile Apps vs Particl dApps Comparison</h3><p>A good analogy to better illustrate this new modular concept is by comparing Particl dApps to iOS or Android apps. Once installed on a phone, mobile applications, in a sense, take the form of independent “modules” that do not need direct access to the underlying hardware features.</p><p>Instead, should an app require access to the device’s camera, it requests permission to use the OS’s pre-packaged module that grants access rights to third-party applications. This means the mobile team does not need to re-implement all the code and logic around using a device’s camera; it merely requests this functionality from the OS.<br>This, in many ways, is the same way Particl modules function. Each of them provides a functionality that dApp developers can simply query access to.</p><p>Not only is this a critical step in making Particl more open to outside contributors, but it’s also making the entire ecosystem much more resilient against outside interference by decentralizing and making more independent the way dApps are developed and maintained.</p><h3 id=\"deploying-particl-s-key-modules\">Deploying Particl’s Key Modules</h3><p>Among the wide variety of functionality and services that can be isolated into modules, here are a few of which the team will initially focus on as we embark on this new development phase.</p><ul><li><strong>Blockchain node modules</strong> (to integrate other cryptocurrencies)</li><li><strong>Payment module</strong> (to provide payment solutions)</li><li><strong>Market-related modules</strong> (to provide out-of-the-box eCommerce services)</li><li><strong>Two-party escrow system</strong> (to provide trade assurance)</li><li><strong>SMSG — End-to-end encrypted chat</strong> (for safe communications)</li><li><strong>SMSG — Decentralized storage</strong> (to store data online)</li><li><strong>SMSG — Decentralized hosting</strong> (to host web content and dApps)</li><li><strong>SMSG — Controller module</strong> (to process, interpret, and interact with SMSG messages (back-end services for developers))</li><li><strong>Swap modules</strong> (including BasicSwap, to swap cryptocurrencies)</li><li><strong>Staking module</strong> (to integrate PART staking capabilities)</li><li><strong>Third-party integrations</strong> (to integrate extraneous protocols such as Tor, PGP, i2p, IPFS, other mixnets, etc.)</li></ul><p>Note that other functionalities, features, or entire dApps can and will be isolated into modules as well. The above list merely showcases the most critical ones but doesn’t go over all possibilities.</p><h3 id=\"how-does-this-benefit-particl\">How Does This Benefit Particl?</h3><p>The ecosystem's modular evolution introduces many benefits critical to the success of Particl. Let's go over the main ones.</p><h4 id=\"makes-development-easier-and-increases-production-pace\">Makes development easier and increases production pace</h4><p>With a proper SDK toolkit at the disposal of developers, it becomes easier to develop an application when not having to deal with various setup and maintenance burdens.</p><p>Currently, each new dApp added to Particl Desktop is built directly into the client, meaning that each app needs to consider how the entire desktop client fits together, as well as how the current dApp impacts each of the other built-in apps.</p><p>For example, the marketplace messaging system that is currently built into the marketplace needs to be aware of how the whole dApp handles SMSG messages simply because it itself requires messaging capabilities. Therefore, any change to how Particl Marketplace handles messages requires changes to be made to the messaging system implementation as well, essentially doubling the amount of work required and making any new feature or implementation a permanent development burden to maintain.</p><p>This type of situation can be avoided by isolating this messaging feature into an independent and standardized module, allowing dApp developers to simply request an out-of-the-box chat functionality from the appropriate module instead of creating it from scratch.</p><p>This will significantly speed up the development of dApps and facilitate community contributions by making it easier, faster, and more straightforward to build dApps that ensure users’ rights are respected.</p><h4 id=\"make-dapp-maintenance-independent-from-the-particl-team-or-platform-they-re-hosted-on\">Make dApp maintenance independent from the Particl team or platform they’re hosted on</h4><p>Adding to the benefit mentioned above, the introduction of modules makes dApps entirely independent from the Particl team and the access gateway they're made available on.</p><p>Let's use the popular Steam gaming platform as an example to better illustrate what this means.</p><p>Steam was originally built to distribute Valve Software's games and updates to those games, after which it grew to become a general gaming \"launcher\" platform. As a result, it is today one of the most well-known means of obtaining games online.</p><p>When a game installed on Steam requires an update, it can be updated on its own, by the game development team, without requiring a Steam client-wide update. If the Steam team needed to maintain, fix, and push updates for each game they host on their ecosystem, it would quickly become an unscalable and highly impractical situation.</p><p>That is, however, how the Particl ecosystem currently functions. Once a dApp or new feature is settled on and integrated into the current Particl Desktop client, the burden of maintenance falls on the Particl development team. In addition, the original author of a dApp or feature, which may or may not be a Particl team member, might no longer wish or be able to maintain the code, thus transferring all these responsibilities to the Particl team for all future Particl Desktop releases.</p><p>And then, even if the dApp author keeps on contributing, knowledge of all future planned updates and changes to any portion of the Particl code is required by the author as it may affect their own dApp and require adaptation coding work.</p><p>Ultimately, this causes Particl Desktop releases to become increasingly dependent on timely contributions from said authors, leading to delays and inefficiencies. In the context of a wide and open dApp ecosystem, it is an unmaintainable situation.</p><p>The new modular architecture eliminates these issues and enables independent dApp developers to develop and maintain their products separately from the Particl team or Particl Desktop releases schedules and according to their own terms.</p><h4 id=\"faster-rollout-for-updates-new-features-and-bug-fixes\">Faster rollout for updates, new features, and bug fixes</h4><p>Right now, a bug fix to a dApp such as Particl Marketplace requires an entire Particl Desktop client release. A bug fix under the new scenario can be rolled out as soon as the author feels it's ready, without needing to consider an entire client update or involve the Particl team.</p><p>That's because the bug fix, in that case, would be pushed not to the desktop client itself but to the precise module affected by it, which then gets automatically updated on all dApps that use that module.</p><p>This, again, takes the responsibility off of the Particl team and lets it focus on the greater vision while contributors can promptly push their own fixes and manage their apps without relying on the team's actions.</p><p>For example, if a dApp uses a Tor module to route traffic through Tor, it wouldn't need an ecosystem-wide update whenever Tor pushes an update to their network. The update would instead be automatically applied to the module, ensuring that all Particl dApps with Tor functionality are kept up-to-date with security fixes.</p><p>This is a major stride towards better dApp security and more timely updates.</p><h3 id=\"in-summary\">In Summary</h3><p>Particl's new modular architecture opens many doors, essentially transforming the Particl ecosystem into a privacy-conscious and decentralized foundation for the new internet.</p><p>This new approach can be broadly summarized in three key points:</p><ol><li>The Particl ecosystem isn't any more a single big block of code; instead, it is separated into independent modules, making it more open, accessible, and developer-friendly than ever. It is also more resilient against central points of failure.</li><li>Instead of requiring developers to re-implement all key functionalities, dApps can simply request it to a particular module without building everything or integrating everything from scratch, much like the example of mobile OSes and mobile apps we've highlighted just above.</li><li>DApps become entirely independent from the Particl team, the wider Particl ecosystem, and the access gateway on which they're made available.</li></ol><h2 id=\"3-access-gateways-and-dapp-accessibility\">3. Access Gateways and dApp Accessibility</h2><p>One of the most important goals of this new development cycle is to improve accessibility to Particl dApps so that they can be used by almost anyone, without complicated steps, and to stop relying exclusively on a single desktop application for all purposes. <strong>This third fold of Particl's strategic plan is a critical aspect in getting any sort of organic and sustained adoption.</strong></p><p>As such, Particl's new modular approach makes it much easier to integrate modules, or whole dApps, into different access gateways such as web or mobile frameworks or even into third-party applications.</p><h3 id=\"web-access\">Web Access</h3><p>However, <a href=\"https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/\">as we’ve explored</a>, hosting dApps on top of the current and centralized web environment, while highly convenient, carries critical vulnerabilities and heavy downsides. With these challenges in mind, we plan on enabling alternative web hosting solutions, notably through SMSG 2.0’s content hosting capabilities.</p><p>Indeed, as we’ve mentioned earlier, SMSG 2.0 is scheduled to evolve from a distributed messaging protocol into a full-blown internet protocol more akin to something like Tor or i2p, eventually enabling dApps to be hosted on it and accessed from web browsers.</p><p>Of course, with Particl becoming so flexible and open to community contributors, we fully expect more traditional web and mobile versions of Particl dApps (i.e., Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap DEX, two-party escrow system, end-to-end encrypted messenger) to be made available. The team also intends to deliver such solutions to provide more options to the end-user.</p><h3 id=\"a-new-modular-particl-desktop\">A New Modular Particl Desktop</h3><p>Just like the rest of the ecosystem, Particl Desktop will become a modular client, enabling the end-user to add, remove, and configure dApps as they wish. This promotes openness and choice and ensures that users do not need to install every Particl dApp, some of which they may have no use for.</p><p>For example, one might not care about the Governance dApp, but the user is still currently forced to have it available because it is hard-coded into Particl Desktop. Alternatively, a user may not want to run the marketplace at all. Still, they are required to do so and, by the same process, spend computer resources decrypting all SMSG messages related to it (i.e., listings).</p><p>With a modular approach, the user could simply remove the marketplace dApp from their Particl Desktop application or simply never have to install it in the first place.</p><h4 id=\"dapp-store\">DApp Store</h4><p>To promote Particl’s vision, a “dApp store” may be made available, on which a list of official or recommended dApps would be featured with the ability for independent contributors to push their own dApps and modules to it.</p><p>Of course, in the spirit of openness and decentralization, the dApp store will be a convenient but optional platform for interacting with those dApps. As open-source applications, it will be possible to download or install them via other ways as well.</p><h2 id=\"4-currency-and-protocol-agnosticism\">4. Currency and Protocol Agnosticism</h2><p>To further promote openness and become an all-inclusive foundation for the internet of tomorrow, Particl is fully embracing the concept of agnosticism by ensuring its ecosystem can remain compatible with other cryptocurrencies and protocols. <strong>This is the fourth fold of Particl's strategic plan</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"currency-agnosticism\">Currency Agnosticism</h3><p>As part of the range of modules available to developers will be cryptocurrency-specific modules that makes it possible for certain dApps to support other cryptocurrencies (i.e., Bitcoin).</p><p>Although not all cryptocurrencies may be able to use all Particl features and services (some of them requiring very specific functionality unique to the PART privacy coin), this will extend the ecosystem's reach by welcoming other cryptocurrency communities and providing them with more utility for their coin.</p><p>When a cryptocurrency cannot use a specific Particl functionality, a swap module, like BasicSwap DEX, for example, can be added to let the end-user swap their coins for PART or even have the dApp execute that action automatically as a background process. This will allow holders of other cryptocurrencies to seamlessly benefit from Particl-specific features without negatively affecting the user experience.</p><p>In the exact same way, a fiat gateway module, such as a service offering credit card purchases of cryptocurrencies, can be added to the ecosystem and leveraged by dApp developers to provide added functionality to their products — further bridging the gap between the legacy payment industry and the world of cryptocurrencies.</p><h3 id=\"protocol-agnosticism\">Protocol Agnosticism</h3><p>Because dApps are developed using modules, it is possible to leverage protocols that are not native to the Particl ecosystem to build some of their features.</p><p>For example, SMSG provides chat functionality to dApps through its messaging module. But a developer could decide to instead integrate a different messaging protocol, like <a href=\"https://matrix.org/\">matrix</a>, which powers the <a href=\"https://riot.im/app/#/room/#particl-project:matrix.org\">Element Messenger</a>. This would still grant the dApp with messaging capabilities, but a different protocol would power it.</p><p>There are three main reasons behind this approach. For one, distinct protocols have different pros and cons. Some use cases may get more out of a particular protocol, while a different dApp may find it more efficient to use another. This gives more flexibility to developers and lets them work with what they think is in the best interest of their users.</p><p>Secondly, it makes Particl dApps more resistant to the test of time. As technology evolves very rapidly, it is not rare to see major protocol innovations appear. And because it's likely that, over time, better versions of protocols used to build dApps become available, developers require the ability to seamlessly swap protocols to keep up with the evolutionary curve. In other words, it makes it significantly easier to keep Particl dApps up-to-date with the most recent progress in the space, ensuring the user gets the most of what is possible at the time that they use a dApp.</p><p>Finally, it also makes dApps more secure and resilient against attacks. For example, if a vulnerability is found in the protocol powering a certain dApp, its developer can simply swap the faulty module for an unaffected alternative. This lets developers act quickly when there are security issues while preserving the integrity of the other components of a dApp.</p><h2 id=\"new-particl-dapps-are-coming-around\">New Particl dApps are Coming Around</h2><p>Particl’s new modular approach opens up a ton of opportunities. Not only does it enable more efficient and secure dApps, but it also completely opens up its development process to the world.</p><p>Moreover, with <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io\">Particl’s CCS platform</a>, anyone can publish proposals seeking to fund the development of various dApps, creating a fully self-perpetuating economy and environment. And we know the Particl community is not short of ideas! Indeed, once the modular architecture is deployed, we fully expect to see a rapid increase in the number of community-led initiatives.</p><p>That being said, the Particl team will, of course, be working on its own dApps not only to showcase what is possible with the improved Particl infrastructure but also to lead the way towards a better, fairer digital world for all.</p><p>Here are dApps or services the Particl team will work on once different components of the modular infrastructure go live.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center full light-one\" id=\"btn-add_01\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"col\">\n    <div class=\"tabs\">\n      <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">New version of the marketplace</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            This development cycle changes the back-end of the ecosystem so much that a completely new version of the marketplace will need to be deployed.\n            <br><br>\n            More flexible, fast, and agnostic than the current version, it will offer the same functionality but in a much more accessible way.

The new versions of these products will be built in parallel to existing Particl dApps. Therefore, there will be no changes to the availability of current dApps while the improvements to the ecosystem are being made, and they will still be maintained as required. Only when new versions of these applications are launched will the legacy versions be deprecated.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n        \n      <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck3\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck3\">Does adding the ability to use other coins within the ecosystem render PART useless?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Absolutely not. PART is and will remain a critical component of the Particl ecosystem. It is what powers its transactional privacy and is a requirement for interacting with some of the more complex Particl smart contracts. Remember, what makes PART unique is that it possesses both privacy and flexibility, a key aspect to many functions provided by Particl dApps that other cryptocurrencies cannot replicate.\n            <br><br>\n            For example, while an application built using Particl modules may allow for Monero payments, Monero still cannot be used with something like Particl’s two-party escrow system. In that case, the dApp’s developer may instead use a payment module, then a swap module to allow users to easily swap their Monero for PART. This would let Monero users benefit from some of the more advanced marketplace functions, such as its escrow capabilities, while still interacting with it using Monero even if the payment ultimately settles in PART.\n            <br><br>\n            On the other hand, if a dApp requires simple payments to be made (for instance, sending Monero through messages sent via the upcoming messenger application), then it may be possible to use Monero directly without having to route the payment through PART.\n            <br><br>\n            We aim to build an open and free ecosystem for all; forcing people to use a single cryptocurrency when they could be using others goes against that ethos. By opening up the Particl ecosystem to the wider cryptocurrency community, we significantly increase the range of potential Particl dApps users and successfully bring new levels of liberty and privacy to more people. After all, this is Particl’s fundamental mission. \n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck4\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck4\">Doesn’t this evolutionary process open up the door for more centralization?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Because Particl is about to become much more open-ended and easy to work with, businesses or independent developers may be interested in coding dApps that are more centralized than, for example, the current version of Particl Marketplace (which makes no compromise whatsoever on that end). But at the end of the day, it becomes up to the user to use that \"more centralized\" service or a more open/decentralized/private service instead, basing their decision on what's best for them.\n            <br><br>\n            Nonetheless, even when accounting for future, more centralized applications, their inclusion in the ecosystem brings considerable benefits at the level of decentralization.\n            <br><br>\n            First, it decentralizes the development process of the entire ecosystem by giving easy-to-use tools for developers and business people all around the world. No more will the platform's growth entirely depend on the core Particl development team — the new open and modular infrastructure will make it very easy for anyone to work on their own vision of Particl. This also radically improves the resilience of the network as a whole.\n            <br><br>\n            Secondly, combined with the CCS crowdfunding platform, this will positively impact the amount and efficiency of contributions from the community as it will be possible to self-fund great ideas using the treasury system, then realize them using easy-to-use dev tools. Particl is blessed to have a strong community that often comes up with great and revolutionary ideas, which we, the Particl team, are excited about but unable to give the time they would require (because of the current maintenance requirements and our own roadmap). This new evolutionary leap forward fixes that obstacle.\n            <br><br>\n            The evolution of Particl's architecture to a modular one changes everything and gives all the power to users. Anyone with a great idea or who wishes to create a certain dApp on Particl can easily submit a proposal, get it approved by the community for funding, and either code it themselves or find a third-party developer to do it. Using modules, bringing an idea to life will be possible for almost any Web3 developer.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck6\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck6\">Does Particl have the funds required to make all of that happen?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Although the current price of PART presents a challenge in terms of growth for the team, we’ve got enough funds to last for the duration of this development cycle at the current pace.\n            <br><br>\n            However, we've recently been actively working on raising funds from external investors to complement the monthly claims from the network's treasury and accelerate our progress.

But, of course, this is highly contingent on the amount of funding at our disposal, whether through better PART prices or external funding. This is why we've recently made raising funds one of our top priorities.\n            <br><br>\n            Besides, one of the critical goal of this cycle is to further decentralize the development process to allow more independent developers to contribute to the ecosystem on their own. This will reduce the burden on the Particl team and allow for more people to help the network grow. \n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck8\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck8\">What about marketing in all of this?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Again, the scale and timing of marketing efforts is equally contingent on the amount of funding at the team's disposal. And although this evolutionary leap forward is mostly development-focused — as it deals with foundational work — we still have different marketing and communications initiatives ready to deploy as soon as financial capabilities permit.\n            <br><br>\n            But, at its core, this \"foundational phase\" is a necessary step that will result in much more accessible, user-friendly, and convenient dApps — a critical factor that affects both user acquisition and retention, and also leads to better marketing ROI. For this reason, it is, in many ways, a long-term play towards future marketing and outreach efforts, ensuring Particl dApps live up to the hype of the marketing efforts that will promote them.\n            <br><br>\n            In addition, this entire phase expands on the ecosystem’s use cases and target audiences — essentially vastly increasing our pool of potential users. The team fully expects to capitalize on this opportunity by carefully and gradually increasing marketing and outreach efforts as we progress through this cycle’s critical milestones, notably as we incrementally release new products and major updates.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck9\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck9\">Does that mean that dApps like Particl Marketplace could be integrated into other cryptocurrency wallets?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Yes. Even further, it means that any Particl dApp can be ‘white labeled’ or re-interpreted by anyone. A cryptocurrency project could, for example, integrate Particl Marketplace into its own coin wallet, take out the escrow, and force payments to be made exclusively using their cryptocurrency. Then, to pay for the SMSG anti-spam fee, they could simply build a system around a swap module like BasicSwap to automatically and seamlessly exchange their native coin to PART to pay for listing fees. \n            <br><br>\n            In fact, there is great potential for these sorts of projects. Third-party integrations and white-labeled solutions can help more communities thrive by reaping the network's liberty and privacy benefits. It can also generate revenue for the project in a way that's mutually beneficial for all parties involved.

However, this time estimate will likely improve as we gradually grow the team and fill various key positions following a successful funding round. However, it's important to note that these months spent working through this development phase will be far from uneventful as we have planned several incremental releases. Therefore, 12 to 18 months is the estimate for the entire process to be over, but in the meantime, you can expect different exciting releases to keep things very interesting.\n            <br><br>\n            For example, while it may take longer to release the new version of Particl Marketplace, largely due to its complexity and the sheer number of modules it uses, SMSG 2.0 or the privacy-first messenger app might launch before that time. That’s because the new version of Particl Marketplace uses many different modules which, individually, will be ready at different points in time. \n            <br><br>\n            In the case of the privacy-first messenger app, it is, at its core, a much simpler dApp. Because it uses fewer modules than Particl Marketplace, it would be much easier and quicker to deploy. And since the messaging function of SMSG is expected to be leveraged by many future dApp, it only makes sense to deploy it early on into the process.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n    </div><!-- tabs close-->\n  </div><!-- col close-->\n</div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html-->","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":["kg-card","kg-image-card","kg-width-wide"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"/glink/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg","className":["kg-image"],"alt":"","srcSet":["/glink/size/w600/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 600w","/glink/size/w1000/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 1000w","/glink/size/w1600/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 1600w","/glink/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 1920w"],"sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"If you’ve been following Particl closely, then you may have heard whispers that the Particl team is gearing up to undertake a new major development cycle.

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively targeting transformation into hard money.</strong></p><p>At present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget generated by:</p><ul><li>Network transaction fees</li><li>New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).</li></ul><p>Staking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active circulation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new tokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens minted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases - rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by<br>new token issuance (supply inflation).</p><p>In many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism of asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes that we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token for yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked will either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network grows.</p><p>Staking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not actively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity. Staking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value of circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however paradoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are essentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity that brings intrinsic value<br>to the network.</p><p>So if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed towards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully transform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?</p><p>Simple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the frequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively reducing new token issuance.</p><p>Fortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key applications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:</p><h3 id=\"basicswapdex-bsx-\">BasicSwapDex (BSX)</h3><ul><li>Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​</li><li>​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third party<br>integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap) with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</h3><ul><li>Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds utilised in purchasing goods and services.​</li><li>​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.</li></ul><p><strong>In any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development team and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl network otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time.</strong> They are effectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual supply inflation reward decreases.</p><p>I note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation rate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that result in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft currency.</p><p><strong>It is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus on increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability</strong> to create an L1 system whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to adequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful in that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with additional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money<br>than traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other cryptocurrencies currently traded today.</p><p>Regardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community is active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to further propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to 0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency funded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that satisfies my definition of “hard money”.</p><h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2><ul><li>Voting opens: Est.

This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively targeting transformation into hard money.</strong></p><p>At present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget generated by:</p><ul><li>Network transaction fees</li><li>New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).</li></ul><p>Staking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active circulation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new tokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens minted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases - rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by<br>new token issuance (supply inflation).</p><p>In many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism of asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes that we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token for yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked will either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network grows.</p><p>Staking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not actively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity. Staking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value of circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however paradoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are essentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity that brings intrinsic value<br>to the network.</p><p>So if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed towards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully transform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?</p><p>Simple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the frequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively reducing new token issuance.</p><p>Fortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key applications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:</p><h3 id=\"basicswapdex-bsx-\">BasicSwapDex (BSX)</h3><ul><li>Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​</li><li>​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third party<br>integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap) with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</h3><ul><li>Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds utilised in purchasing goods and services.​</li><li>​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.</li></ul><p><strong>In any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development team and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl network otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time.</strong> They are effectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual supply inflation reward decreases.</p><p>I note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation rate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that result in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft currency.</p><p><strong>It is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus on increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability</strong> to create an L1 system whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to adequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful in that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with additional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money<br>than traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other cryptocurrencies currently traded today.</p><p>Regardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community is active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to further propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to 0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency funded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that satisfies my definition of “hard money”.</p><h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2><ul><li>Voting opens: Est.
