The Particl discussion forum is now\nlive and ready to use! This new platform will allow the entire community as well\nas Particl team members to communicate in a new, more organized way than on a\nchat platform. It has already been populated with content such as articles,\ntutorials, posts, news, archived discussions, and more to help kickstart it.\nWithout further ado, let’s dive right in into what this platform is going to\nbring to the Particl community!\n\nFORUM LINK: https://particl.community\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore Details\nDiscourse\nOur new discussion forum [https://particl.community] is based on Discourse\n[http://discourse.com], a slick-looking and high-performance forum platform\ndesigned for the modern-day internet. In fact, Discourse is a very smooth\nplatform which will make the Particl forum experience as smooth as silk as well\nas enable a wide variety of engaging features that will surely come in handy in\nvarious situations. Here are some of the highlights from our own Discourse\nsetup:\n\nStructured Discussions\nThis new forum will help better structure all the discussions going around the\ncommunity. As it stood up until now, the great majority of discussions within\nthe community happened over one of our instant messaging platforms such as\nTelegram or Discord. While this does provide a dynamic way of discussing with\nyour peers in real-time, it fails to make these discussions accessible.\n\nParticl Forum’s HomepageIn fact, there is only a small number of Telegram and\nDiscord channels, most of which are being underused because of the separation\nthey create with the rest of the community which mostly hangs on #general.\nMoreover, discussions quickly get buried under days and weeks of chatter and, at\nsome point, disappear whenever they get too old. This is obviously not an ideal\nset up, especially when it comes to help & support; different users will often\nbe asking the same questions because they cannot be expected to scroll weeks of\nchatter to see if their question has already been answered.\n\nLet’s also not forget that our community is still relatively small compared to\nits full potential when the marketplace will be on mainnet. In fact, some of the\nbigger cryptocurrency communities hosted on Telegram are quite chaotic due to\nthe very nature of instant messaging platforms, so it only makes sense to\nprepare our infrastructure for when we get a good influx of new users.\nFurthermore, as the “forum format” is very popular on the internet and used by\nmillions of people every day, and as we may very well get users that are not\ncryptocurrency users or simply not used to hang in instant messaging platforms,\nhaving a more intuitive and easy-to-navigate platform will surely be something\nthat will make life easier for a lot of people.\n\nCentral Point of Information\nParticl is all about decentralization, but that doesn’t mean the information\nsurrounding the project has to be all over the place. While the Particl Wiki\nalready does more or less of a good job to keep the information about Particl\norganized, we believe the forum will also help a lot. For example, any support\nrequired by a user and later marked as solved will be easy to dig back out and\nlink back to any other user having similar issues.\n\nAny article, video, news, and similar posts will be very easy to find for users,\nand this “everything-under-the-same-hood” approach will definitely help\nnewcomers quickly find the information they are looking for. This is but one\nmore step towards making Particl information more accessible to as many people\nas possible!\n\nHelp & Support\nAmong the many categories that are initially included with the Particl forum is\na Help & Support category. We strongly believe this category to be an absolute\nrequirement for the improvement of user support as well as to make it much\neasier for anyone to find the information they need without having to scroll\nweeks of unrelated discussions on Telegram or Discord. As such, we have ported\nour Particl Wiki [http://particl.wiki]’s FAQ into a pinned thread\n[https://particl.community/t/frequently-asked-questions-faq/43/2] so that users\ncould easily answer the most frequently asked questions by themselves or ask\ntheir questions, if they are not already included, as a reply to the FAQ thread\nso that it could be added to it upon resolving.\n\nMoreover, the forum format is used around the world and is a very popular and\ninstinctive platform to grow communities on. We believe that, as we release the\nmainnet version of Particl Marketplace and attract vendors and buyers, it will\nbecome a very valuable platform to help and support these users which may\nactually not be used to, or tempted to use, chat platforms such as Telegram or\nDiscord.\n\nArchived Discussions\nArchived discussions are discussions of interest that happen outside the Particl\nforum but are archived on it. The reason these discussions are getting archived\non the Particl Forum [https://particl.community/tags/archive] is that they are\nthought of as constructive, interesting, and in general, adding value to the\nbroader Particl discussion.\n\nAs mentioned throughout this post, many of the platforms we are on (i.e.\nTelegram, Discord, etc) are not ideal when it comes to preserving discussions\nand making them easily accessible. Particl Forum, on the other hand, offers a\nmuch more structured way of preserving and categorizing discussions or thoughts,\nhence why we believe noteworthy discussions should be made easily available for\nall to see, even if it has been weeks or months since they happened.\n\nNote: There is no “Archives” category. We prefer putting every archived\ndiscussion within the category it fits in to make them easier to find. You can,\nhowever, simply select the archive [https://particl.community/tags/archive] tag\nto filter all the forum posts and only display archived posts. To do so, go to\nthe main page of the forum and select archive\n[https://particl.community/tags/archive] as the tag filter.\n\nFor more information about archived discussions, visit this thread: \nhttps://particl.community/t/what-are-archived-discussions/79\n\nFor a good example of an archived discussions, read What is Dandelion?\n[https://particl.community/t/what-is-dandelion/78]\n\nSelf-Governance\nAn interesting feature of the Discourse platform is that it allows, not too\nunlike Particl Marketplace, the community to govern itself. In fact, Discourse\nincludes a trust system as well as a flagging/report system that can hide\ninappropriate posts once they reach a certain threshold calculated by crunching\ntogether trust levels and numbers of flags. Users that reach trust level 4, the\nhighest trust level, are even granted limited moderating powers which allow them\nto keep the environment clean when no moderators are around. After all, users\ntrust level 4 are those trusted ones that have been hanging around the forum for\nthe most time and have made quality contributions to it.\n\nTo learn more about Discourse’s self-governance mechanism, read this article\nposted on the official Discourse blog: \nhttps://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/\n\nParticl Proposal Discussions\nAs many of you already know, our development team has been working on the \nProject Governance mechanism that will allow any Particl users to create,\nsubmit, and vote on proposals directly within the Particl Desktop wallet\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6].\nParticl Desktop does not, however, support proposal discussions. These proposal\ndiscussions and debates are expected to be vital to the voting and consensus\nreaching process and would benefit a lot from a more organized way to go about\nthem.\n\nThe Particl forum contains a Proposals\n[https://particl.community/c/general-discussion/proposals] sub-category within\nthe General [https://particl.community/c/general-discussion] category. Because\nParticl Desktop allows users to link to an external discussion thread, it is\nrecommended that users first submit their proposal on the forum and then submit\nit to the network (with the link to the discussion thread included in the\nsubmission). This will help people easily find the thread dedicated to a\nspecific proposal and discuss what’s being proposed in a well-structured fashion\nand for all voters to see.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFun Social Features\nNot only is Discourse full of useful features, but it’s also full of fun and\nsocial features! In fact, we’ve added a lot of plugins to the vanilla version of\nDiscourse, including a custom-theme, that makes hanging on the Particl forum a\nreal treat.\n\nUser Cards\nCryptoguard’s User CardUser cards are a small profile summary attached to every\nuser that can be displayed simply by clicking on the user’s avatar. They display\na lot of useful information about the user in question such as social media\nplatform usernames, forum statistics, title, and badges. They allow users to\nquickly preview another user’s profile without requiring to quit the page or\nthread they’re currently on. This is an excellent way to display your forum\nachievements and activity to the rest of the community as well as making\nyourself easier to reach out to on any platform you’re on!\n\nBadges\nA few examples of custom badges made for the Particl forumBadges are forum\n“achievements” you acquire throughout your journey on the Particl forum and are\nmeant to showcase to the rest of the community your involvement within the\nproject. On top of the default badges included in the vanilla version of\nDiscourse, we’ve added a few of them (such as Wiki Contributor, Alpha Tester, \nBug Finder, Coin Swapper, and etc) to highlight some of our own milestones and\ncommunity achievements. They are an excellent way to build a reputation for\nyourself and showcase your support and involvement in the project! For a list of\nthe currently available badges, visit the forum’s badges page\n[https://particl.community/badges]. Note that more badges will be added as we\nmove forward and receive suggestions from the community.\n\nReactions\nYou can react to posts and threads the same way you can do it on Discord or\nSlack. Indeed, on top of the “like” function that comes with the default version\nof Discourse, we’ve added a plugin which allows users to “react” on posts using\nany emojis. Don’t be afraid to show how you feel about a certain post! ?\n\nPolls\nExample of a poll within a threadPolls are going to be useful for anyone that\nwants to poll the community about a certain issue, matter, or question. Up until\nnow, polls were exclusively held on either Twitter or Discord (using “reacts”),\na set up that wasn’t optimal. In fact, if you didn’t have a Twitter account, you\ncouldn’t vote on Twitter polls. If the poll was held instead on Discord, it was\ngetting buried by the constant chatter within only a few hours. Discord polls\nalso do not allow for very complex sets of options.\n\nWith the Particl forum’s polling feature, polls can now be properly referenced\nby a link and are opened to every member of the community. Yes, you will need a\nforum account to participate, but it is, in the end, a much more private\nsolution (don’t need to provide a phone number, unlike Twitter), convenient\n(doesn’t get buried, can be easily linked to and shared), and flexible (can put\nmany options and include much more details) way to do it.\n\nSwap Angels\nBack when the community decided to go ahead with the Community Initiative to\naccommodate late swappers\n[https://particl.news/a-community-driven-initiative-e26724100c3a], it was\ndiscussed within the community that the people who would donate may, possibly,\nreceive some kind of flair or special mention as a token of appreciation. As we\nslowly, but surely, head towards the mainnet release of the long-awaited Particl\nMarketplace, we believe that now would be a great time to celebrate our generous\nveteran holders who have donated some of their personal funds to help and rescue\nlate swappers.\n\nAs of today, donors to the initiative will be able to display a special badge, \nflair, title or any combination of those on their profile and user card. These\noptional options can be granted to donors’ Particl forum accounts simply by\nsending a message containing your Particl Portal username as well as whether you\nwould like to be displayed on the Hall of Fame thread or not to Cryptoguard\n[https://particl.community/u/cryptoguard/summary].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional Resources\nTutorial\nIf you would like to follow an interactive tutorial that will show you the basic\nfunctions of Discourse, simply read the message from @discobot that you will\nautomatically receive in your inbox upon signing up and follow through his\ninstructions.

The Particl discussion forum is now live and ready to use! This new platform will allow the entire community as well as Particl team members to communicate in a new, more organized way than on a chat platform.

Without further ado, let’s dive right in into what this platform is going to bring to the Particl community!</p><p><strong>FORUM LINK: </strong><a href=\"https://particl.community\"><strong>https://particl.community</strong></a></p><hr><h2 id=\"more-details\">More Details</h2><h3 id=\"discourse\">Discourse</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Particl-Forum-is-Now-Live-/1-lCk_rFM_3CbbdQBes3DdXg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p><a href=\"https://particl.community\">Our new discussion forum</a> is based on <a href=\"http://discourse.com\">Discourse</a>, a slick-looking and high-performance forum platform designed for the modern-day internet. In fact, Discourse is a very smooth platform which will make the Particl forum experience as smooth as silk as well as enable a wide variety of engaging features that will surely come in handy in various situations. Here are some of the highlights from our own Discourse setup:</p><h3 id=\"structured-discussions\"><strong>Structured Discussions</strong></h3><p>This new forum will help better structure all the discussions going around the community. As it stood up until now, the great majority of discussions within the community happened over one of our instant messaging platforms such as Telegram or Discord. While this does provide a dynamic way of discussing with your peers in real-time, it fails to make these discussions accessible.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Particl-Forum-is-Now-Live-/1-yaWqiLCzUjOfiIEUk0pU0w.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl Forum’s Homepage</figcaption></figure><p>In fact, there is only a small number of Telegram and Discord channels, most of which are being underused because of the separation they create with the rest of the community which mostly hangs on #general. Moreover, discussions quickly get buried under days and weeks of chatter and, at some point, disappear whenever they get too old. This is obviously not an ideal set up, especially when it comes to help &amp; support; different users will often be asking the same questions because they cannot be expected to scroll weeks of chatter to see if their question has already been answered.</p><p>Let’s also not forget that our community is still relatively small compared to its full potential when the marketplace will be on mainnet. In fact, some of the bigger cryptocurrency communities hosted on Telegram are quite chaotic due to the very nature of instant messaging platforms, so it only makes sense to prepare our infrastructure for when we get a good influx of new users. Furthermore, as the “forum format” is very popular on the internet and used by millions of people every day, and as we may very well get users that are not cryptocurrency users or simply not used to hang in instant messaging platforms, having a more intuitive and easy-to-navigate platform will surely be something that will make life easier for a lot of people.</p><h3 id=\"central-point-of-information\">Central Point of Information</h3><p>Particl is all about decentralization, but that doesn’t mean the information surrounding the project has to be all over the place. While the Particl Wiki already does more or less of a good job to keep the information about Particl organized, we believe the forum will also help a lot. For example, any support required by a user and later marked as <strong>solved</strong> will be easy to dig back out and link back to any other user having similar issues.</p><p>Any article, video, news, and similar posts will be very easy to find for users, and this “everything-under-the-same-hood” approach will definitely help newcomers quickly find the information they are looking for.

We strongly believe this category to be an absolute requirement for the improvement of user support as well as to make it much easier for anyone to find the information they need without having to scroll weeks of unrelated discussions on Telegram or Discord. As such, we have ported our <a href=\"http://particl.wiki\">Particl Wiki</a>’s FAQ into a <a href=\"https://particl.community/t/frequently-asked-questions-faq/43/2\"><strong>pinned thread</strong></a> so that users could easily answer the most frequently asked questions by themselves or ask their questions, if they are not already included, as a reply to the FAQ thread so that it could be added to it upon resolving.</p><p>Moreover, the forum format is used around the world and is a very popular and instinctive platform to grow communities on. We believe that, as we release the mainnet version of Particl Marketplace and attract vendors and buyers, it will become a very valuable platform to help and support these users which may actually not be used to, or tempted to use, chat platforms such as Telegram or Discord.</p><h3 id=\"archived-discussions\">Archived Discussions</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Particl-Forum-is-Now-Live-/1-C2U3BiLI1zUUQ-TuNdZkRw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Archived discussions are discussions of interest that happen outside the Particl forum but are archived on it.

In fact, Discourse includes a trust system as well as a flagging/report system that can hide inappropriate posts once they reach a certain threshold calculated by crunching together trust levels and numbers of flags. Users that reach trust level 4, the highest trust level, are even granted limited moderating powers which allow them to keep the environment clean when no moderators are around. After all, users trust level 4 are those trusted ones that have been hanging around the forum for the most time and have made quality contributions to it.</p><p>To learn more about Discourse’s self-governance mechanism, read this article posted on the official Discourse blog: <a href=\"https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/\">https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/</a></p><h3 id=\"particl-proposal-discussions\">Particl Proposal Discussions</h3><p>As many of you already know, our development team has been working on the <a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\">Project Governance mechanism that will allow any Particl users to create, submit, and vote on proposals directly within the Particl Desktop wallet</a>.

Because Particl Desktop allows users to link to an external discussion thread, it is recommended that users first submit their proposal on the forum and then submit it to the network (with the link to the discussion thread included in the submission).

Up until now, polls were exclusively held on either Twitter or Discord (using “reacts”), a set up that wasn’t optimal. In fact, if you didn’t have a Twitter account, you couldn’t vote on Twitter polls. If the poll was held instead on Discord, it was getting buried by the constant chatter within only a few hours. Discord polls also do not allow for very complex sets of options.</p><p>With the Particl forum’s polling feature, polls can now be properly referenced by a link and are opened to every member of the community. Yes, you will need a forum account to participate, but it is, in the end, a much more private solution (don’t need to provide a phone number, unlike Twitter), convenient (doesn’t get buried, can be easily linked to and shared), and flexible (can put many options and include much more details) way to do it.</p><h3 id=\"swap-angels\">Swap Angels</h3><p>Back when the community <a href=\"https://particl.news/a-community-driven-initiative-e26724100c3a\">decided to go ahead with the Community Initiative to accommodate late swappers</a>, it was discussed within the community that the people who would donate may, possibly, receive some kind of flair or special mention as a token of appreciation.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all.
