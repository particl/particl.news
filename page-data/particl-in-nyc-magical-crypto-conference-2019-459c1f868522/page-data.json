The Open Marketplace\nis a great example of this, but it’s far from being the only aspect contributing\nto the Particl global economy. Cold staking pools are also a key player in\nmaking sure anyone can contribute to the network and earn staking rewards in\nexchange for securing the network.\n\nWhile they’ve been mostly used by small holders to easily pool their funds\ntogether and earn staking rewards more frequently, the possibilities enabled by\nthe cold staking model extend much further than that. Indeed, Community Contract\nPools, a new form of cold staking pool, are at the core of an innovative\neconomic model through decentralized funding. We’d like to introduce this new\nconcept today.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Content (Click Me)\n * Decentralized & Crowd-Sourced Funding Model\n * What’s a Community Contract Pool?\n * How Do I Use Them?\n * What Can a Community Contract Pool Support?\n * Non-Binding Community Contracts\n * Start a Community Contract Pool of Your Own\n * First Community Contract Pool Goes Live This Week\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDecentralized & Crowd-Sourced Funding Model\nIf you’ve been around the community for some time, then you probably know that\nthere have always been some discussions about setting up some sort of passive\nfunding mechanism through Particl Proof-of-Stake. After all, Proof-of-Stake\nprotocols are ripe for this — they reward you with coin rewards in exchange for\nsecuring the network. And, let’s be honest here, “securing the network” is a\npretty laidback process that doesn’t actually involve much manual labor. You\njust set up cold staking (or connect to a pool in less than 30 seconds\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUvwj-ejng4&list=PLtbTcMbZZKfwl7BxnruR84agicV1SyrYF&index=5]\n), sit back, and watch your staking rewards pouring in, nicely growing that\nwallet of yours.\n\nThis is precisely what makes passive funding so easy to do. Because donating\nstaking rewards doesn’t actually require you to spend a portion of your initial\ncapital, it makes altruism much easier, especially when it directly benefits the\nnetwork that’s making that form of passive income possible.\n\nOn top of that, airdrops, giveaways, and free stuff, in general, have proven to\nbe effective ways to grow crypto-based communities. With the huge numbers of\nblockchain projects, though, attracting users now requires projects to be as\ncreative as they possibly can. Luckily for Particl, it possesses some pretty\ncool and innovative tech that can be used, along with a bit of creativity, to\ncreate some pretty exciting incentive programs and passive donation concepts.\n\nSupporting a Community Contract Pool is not just a donation, it is an investment\nyou’re making into the Particl ecosystem to bootstrap its economy.\n\nWhat’s a Community Contract Pool?\nA “Community Contract Pool” is a brand new way to use cold staking pools for\nreasons other than just providing an easy and convenient cold staking option.\nThis type of pool charges users with a significant fee (usually 100%) fee and is\nmeant to be used in combination with multi-wallets\n[https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076]. Its\npurpose is to fund initiatives, as established by the pool’s operator, using\npassive community donations in the form of staking rewards.\n\nCommunity Contract Pools are the easiest way to passively crowdfund initiatives\nin order to spark growth within the Particl ecosystem. They are also a great\nshowcase of how the currently available Particl tech can foster a brand new, 2.0\ntype of global economy that simply wasn’t possible before.\n\nHow Do They Work?\nAs mentioned above, Community Contract Pools are meant to be used in combination\nwith multi-wallets\n[https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076]. The reason\nbehind this is pretty simple: stakers likely won’t be looking into giving ALL of\ntheir staking rewards away. No, instead, they’re more likely to be willing to\ndonate only a portion of them. That’s where multi-wallets\n[https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076] come into\nplay.\n\nMulti-wallets\n[https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076] allow you\nto easily manage multiple wallets within the same Particl Desktop instance. It\nis as if you had many wallets opened up at the same time. The key here is that\neach of these wallets can be set up with a different cold staking key. This\nmeans you can have multiple wallets, on the same Particl Desktop instance, each\nstaking using different staking nodes or pools.\n\nAs an example, let’s say that you would like to fund a certain initiative with\n10% of your staking rewards. All you would need to do is pretty simple and it\ncan be done under a minute or two:\n\n * Create a new wallet on Particl Desktop\n * Send 10% of your coins to this new wallet\n * Visit the website of the Community Contract Pool you want to support\n * Locate and copy its public key\n * Connect your newly created wallet by entering the public key in the cold\n   staking widget\n * Zap your funds to start donating your staking rewards immediately\n\nOnce that’s all said and one, 10% of all your staking rewards will now be\nredirected towards the initiative proposed by the Community Contract Pool. Yes,\nyou would be making 10% less in staking revenues, but you’d be fueling up an\ninitiative that can contribute to adding more value to the Particl ecosystem\nthrough an active expansion plan that will benefit you and the entire community.\n\nWhat Can a Community Contract Pool Support?\nSo what are those special pools meant to support? Well, anything really. As its\nname implies, Community Contract Pools can be created by anyone in the\ncommunity, just like any other regular cold staking pool. The operator can\ndecide to support any initiative, cause, or project…and that’s where the \ncreativity side of things comes in handy.\n\nIn fact, Community Contract Pool can propose any initiative:\n\n * A marketing or social media campaign\n * A targeted airdrop to acquire new users\n * A Dapp development fund to support community developers\n * Donations to a privacy-focused organization (i.e. Tor Project, EFF, and etc)\n * An exchange listing\n * A vendor onboarding program\n * Pay for media services and articles\n\nThe possibilities are endless. Go WILD!\n\nNon-Binding Community Contracts\nWhen staking your funds in a Community Contract Pool, you are essentially\nentering a non-binding contract with the pool operator. In exchange for your\nstaking weight, the operator is meant to fulfill the mission for which the pool\nwas created.\n\nHow many funding a Community Contract Pool receives, however, is entirely up to\nthe stakers. Some initiatives might get more popular than others, and the\ndecentralized part of this system gives full freedom of choice to anyone looking\ninto actively contributing with their staking.\n\nStakers can easily and quickly exit the pool, without penalty, at any time and\nfor any reason. Community Contract Pools are, with this in mind, a non-binding\ncontract between the staker and the pool operator.\n\n> Note: Community Contract Pools should ideally be operated by experienced and\ntrusted community members. Pool operators should state the pool’s purpose,\nmission, and program. It should stick to it. As a counterparty, they should be\ntransparent and effective in managing the funds. Particl is not responsible for\nany misbehavior from any pool operated by the community. Stakers should always\ndo their due diligence before donating their staking rewards to a pool operator.\nStart a Community Contract Pool of Your Own\nStarting a Community Contract Pool is no different than starting a regular cold\nstaking pool. The only difference is the fee — up to 100% instead of the regular\n~2.5%. To get all the details on how to start your own cold staking pool, please\nrefer to this tutorial:\n\ntecnovert/particl-coldstakepool\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool/blob/master/doc/vps_setup_example.txt]\nPooled coldstaking demo.

The\ngreater the number of Community Contract Pools, the more initiatives can get\nfunded!\n\nFirst Community Contract Pool Goes Live This Week\nTo kickstart this new concept, we will announce this week the first Community\nContract Pool and reveal its purpose.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
