Without further ado, let's jump right into the meat of this progress\nreport.\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nThis week, we've finalized the improvement to the marketplace that lets you\nremove the default market from Particl Desktop. That change is now completed and\nready for release with the upcoming desktop update.\n\nAdditionally, we've made progress on the messaging system that allows buyers and\nsellers to communicate with each other straight from the marketplace. We've also\nmade progress on the new product code function, and both of these items will get\nprimary focus moving into next week.\n\nOn the topic of product codes, as we've mentioned in our last update, it is an\nessential item for the delivery of the marketplace listing seeding proposal. For\nthat reason, we're making sure that the feature will be ready for Particl\nDesktop 3.2 in order to deploy the system suggested by the proposal promptly. To\nmake that happen more quickly, we will initially release this feature on vendor\nnodes only (no GUI integration).\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Update\nAs for Particl Core, most of the week has been spent improving Particl Electrum\nand fixing a few reported issues. We're happy to report that Particl Electrum is\nnearing its official release and will be made available from both desktop and\nmobile devices. \n\nAdditionally, core's default ring size has also been adjusted to match the\ndefault value of Particl Desktop, improving privacy by unifying the values of\ndecoys.\n\nOn the topic of privacy, we invite you to read an important blog post we've\npublished this week on Particl News. It details our vision for the project, what\nrole privacy plays into it, and why we've designed PART's privacy setup the way\nwe did.

This week, we've made some good progress in improving both Particl\nDesktop and Particl Core, so let's look into it right away.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nThis week, Particl Desktop developer Arnold Bansemer has suffered a minor injury\nthat took time off of major tasks. With this context in mind, he focused on\nsmaller (but needed) and easily deliverable improvements proposed by some of our\nmarketplace sellers.\n\n 1. In the wallet transaction list, transactions that have been abandoned will\n    now be properly displayed instead of showing the current \"0/12\n    confirmations\" indicator. Users will also be able to abandon transactions\n    right from Particl Desktop.\n 2. A filter to the \"batch publish\" modal has been added. It lets sellers filter\n    the visible products by published market, enabling them to more easily\n    republish listings when they have multiple markets and many items (with\n    items specific to particular markets). In short, it provides them the option\n    to only show items belonging to a particular market, rather than searching\n    through all the items across all the markets one by one. In some cases, it\n    can save several minutes, if not hours, especially when it comes to large\n    vendors who often update their inventories and regularly add new items.\n\nLooking forward to the coming week, we'll be able to resume progress on product\ncodes and hopefully wrap it up before the end of the week. Then, we'll continue\nworking on the in-market messaging system to get it ready for the upcoming\nParticl Desktop 3.2 update.\n\nParticl Core Development Update\nThis week, we've added some improvements and bug fixes to the Particl Core 0.21\ncodebase. Notably, an issue was fixed where the wallet can freeze when unlocking\nafter receiving an anon transaction while locked.\n\nIf the user then closes the wallet (unaware that it's stuck), it leads to errors\ncreating future transactions with AddAnonInputsFailed. This issue is now fixed\nas part of Particl Core 0.21.2.7, which is available as a pre-release here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.7].

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nMulti-Net Support ?\nMultinet by tecnovert · Pull Request #311 · basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
