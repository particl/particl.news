Once this integration is complete, we will be\nready to deploy the new system.\n\nIt's important to note that the new moderation tool is entirely optional; no\nuser will be required to run it nor will it come pre-packaged with or\nenabled-by-default in Particl Core. Additionally, moderation policies are fully\ncustomizable and are set by the individual user running an instance of this\nsystem. These policies are defined using natural language, thus allowing for a\nvery intuitive setup.\n\nWe want to emphasize that our team does not, and will not, enforce specific\nmoderation policies or maintain a ban list.

fifth\nfunding request from the Treasury Fund.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-team-funding-request-5/]Earlier this week, we\npublished our fifth community funding proposal which aims to finance the ongoing\noperations of current Particl and BasicSwap contributors, as well as cover\nnetwork-related expenses.\n\nYou can review the proposal [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/24] \nin detail on the CCS platform, or for a more detailed overview, read the \nassociated blog post [https://particl.news/particl-team-funding-request-5/] on\nParticl News which provides additional context and information.\n\nIf you have questions, comments, or feedback regarding the proposal, feel free\nto discuss it within the community channels or leave a direct comment on the CCS\nproposal page (https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/24).\n\nParticl Marketplace Update ?\nWe have made good progress in merging the listing scanner API with the\nAI-powered moderation system. While this integration is still ongoing and\nrequires further testing, we are pleased with the advancements made this week on\nthat end.\n\nUpon completion of this merger, our next step will be to connect the new\nmoderation system to the marketplace itself, ensuring that nodes properly\nbroadcast their votes when they need to and that they're applied to the relevant\nlistings.\n\nTo provide maximum clarity about the architecture of this system, its\nimplications, and the way it is expected to be used by users that wish to\nparticipate in moderating the marketplace, we plan to publish a detailed blog\npost on Particl News which will cover all the basics. However, we are waiting\nfor the system to be completed and ready to be deployed first to allow us the\nflexibility to make any necessary adjustments to the system's components before\nrelease.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nUser Interface  ?️\nWe've unfortunately hit some delays pushing the fixes we wanted to over the week\nas our front-end developer has been mostly unavailable due to health reasons.\nFor this reason, the GUI-related section of this progress report remains the\nsame as it was last week.\n\nThat means we're still gearing up to push a minor update in the next couple of\ndays that will fix a few bugs and include a few improvements, notably to the\ndisplay of QR codes in some cases.\n\nFurthermore, we're hoping for a release of the larger GUI update we've been\nworking on for the past few weeks somewhere next week, if all goes well.\n\nThis larger update will soon be available on GitHub and, as always, and you'll\nbe able to test the changes before they go live by switching to the dev branch.\nThe smaller update, however, will be available directly from the master branch.\n\nIntegration Layer ?\nWe have continued our investigation into the integration of new, alternative\nmessaging protocols into BasicSwap. This would serve two primary purposes: to\nfacilitate the integration of BasicSwap into third-party applications, which\ncarry their own restrictions, and to provide a backup solution to SMSG in\nscenarios where scalability becomes an issue, such as during a sudden,\nsignificant increase in the number of swaps.\n\nAt this time, we are evaluating several options and are also considering\nstandardizing the integration of messaging layers, which could lead to a\nplugin-like system. This approach would allow users to select their preferred\nmessaging layers in the options, but it is still unclear whether or not that\nwill be the preferable path to follow. While our exploration in this area is\nongoing, we have made satisfactory progress in our research and expect to be\nable to take a decision about it shortly.\n\nAdditionally, following discussions with potential partners, we are reviewing\nsections of the BasicSwap codebase that will likely need to be converted into\ndifferent programming languages to ensure proper integration of the DEX into\nthese third-party platforms and to leverage their infrastructure (e.g.,\nintegrated light node). Although this may involve a substantial amount of work,\nit is crucial for simplifying future integrations and improving fundamental\naspects of the codebase at the same time.\n\nIt's important to note that while we do have several individual components\nrequired for this integration layer either in place or at various stages of\ndevelopment, we are still in the early phases of this process and haven't yet\nfully transitioned out of the R&D phase. As such, we may need to refine or\niterate these components as we progress.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nParticl Marketplace Update ?\nWe're currently working on a marketplace message scanner to extract the relevant\ninformation that needs to be analyzed by the LLM-powered moderation script. This\nis our current focus as the portion of the work relating to the LLM logic is now\ncomplete and awaiting the delivery of the scanner.\n\nOnce completed, the next step will be to merge it with the marketplace-related\ncomponent of the system, and then test it extensively before release.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nUser Interface  ?️\nWe've continued with work on improvements to the user interface, including an\nimprovement to the rate system and how coin prices are fetched. The upcoming\nupdate will also contain a full redesign of the new offer page, a redesign of\nthe current \"swaps in progress\" page, a new index page, as well as the inclusion\nof better defined \"terms and conditions\" (taken from BasicSwap's website here\n[https://basicswapdex.com/terms]) that the users will have to accept after\nsetting up BasicSwap for the first time. \n\nAdditionally, we're working on a series of general changes and improvements to\nthe codebase, such as a more distributed API key management system.\n\nThese updates will soon be available on GitHub and, as always, you'll be able to\ntest these changes before they go live by switching to the dev branch.\n\nIntegration Layer ?\nSince coming back from the 2024 Litecoin Summit, we've started designing the\nintegration layer that will make it possible to integrate swap capabilities into\nthird-party applications or on the web.\n\nWhile actual coding hasn't officially started, we expect to begin within a few\ndays as we iron out the last few details. This item is the next major milestone\nfor BasicSwap and will dramatically improve its user experience by making it\nmore intuitive and easy to use via leverage of third-party applications such as\nalready-established crypto wallets or fully integrated web platforms.\n\nAs always, we're designing this integration layer in such a way that will\npreserve decentralization and privacy as much as possible, as per the usual\nethos that comes with BasicSwap and Particl. \n\nAdditionally, working on this integration layer will carry the additional\nbenefit of completing several milestones identified in community contributor\nOfrnxmr's proposal here\n[https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/ccs-proposals/-/merge_requests/457].\n\nParticl and BasicSwap Media ?\nPrivacy Roundtable ?️\nDon't miss our upcoming Privacy Roundtable on X Spaces with our friend from PIVX\nand Firo this coming 5th of August at 9:00 AM EST as we discuss Zcash funding\noperations and improvements, among other topics!\n\nx.comX (formerly Twitter) [https://x.com/_PIVX/status/1819360462598795374]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]Following last week's release\nof the MVP for multi-net capabilities using Simplex as the first alternative\nnetwork, we've identified several Simplex-specific issues that we're currently\nworking to resolve.\n\nDue to Simplex's complex and intricate network architecture, these issues are\nproving challenging to address, requiring additional development time.
