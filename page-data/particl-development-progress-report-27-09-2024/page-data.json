the week ends, let's take a moment to look back at what we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nMarketplace Moderation Update ?\nThis week, we've conducted more extensive testing of the AI-based moderation\nscript, and we're pleased to report that it's performing exactly as intended\nwith the marketplace. We've also successfully integrated the majority of\nadditional features designed to optimize its user-friendliness.\n\nCurrently, we require a bit more time to evaluate the script's performance\nacross a broader range of test listings. Our goal is to cover as many edge cases\nas possible to ensure robustness.\n\nWe're nearing the stage where we'll be ready to publish a detailed blog post\nexplaining the script's functionality, along with releasing its code.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nCodebase ?\nWe've pushed a improvements and bug fixes to the BasicSwap codebase. While these\nchanges are not yet available from the master branch, you can access them by\nbuilding from the dev branch (see here\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commits/dev/]).\n\n * Updated DASH's version and added backwards compatibility (you can now update\n   your DASH node to the latest version)\n * Refactored seed generation code\n * Refactored basicswap_prepare script\n * Improved daemon management when user already has a certain coin's node set up\n   prior to installing BasicSwap\n * XMR core download automatically resumes if interrupted or fails\n\nUser Interface  ?️\nWe're finishing up the next batch of GUI updates, fixing a few bugs we've\nencountered, and plan on pushing them live in the next few days. \n\n * Done: Auto refresh (10min) of the chart + coin prices, with enable/disable\n   option.\n * Done: New shutdown modal, featuring a warning message if a swap is in\n   progress\n * Done: Added filter on chart for 30 days / 1 week / 1 day chart.\n * Done: Better offer pagination system\n * Done: User-selectable default coin display on the chart, with Bitcoin as the\n   default if no choice is made\n * Done: Display last refresh time chart.\n * Done: Fixed rate/percentage in offer(s) table.\n * Done: Dynamic network offers table (manually refreshing the page not required\n   anymore)\n * Wrapping up: Implementation of a Tor-compatible API for prices/rates across\n   all templates when Tor is enabled by the user\n * WIP: Adding alert messages when a coin core needs to be upgrade or when a new\n   version of BasicSwap is available (global notification + notification in the\n   wallets page).\n\nParticl and BasicSwap Media ?\nDr. Kap on MoneroTalk's Show ?️\nEarlier this week, Dr. Kap was invited to discuss BasicSwap DEX on MoneroTalk\nahead of the team's attendance at this year's Monerotopia conference.\n\nIf you're in or around Mexico City, make sure to stop by the event and come meet\nthe team!

These developments and their\nrelevance for the project and its continuation will be expanded further down\nthis blog post.\n\nHere are some highlights of our achievements since the last funding cycle:\n\n * Particl added to MEXC (PART/USDT)\n   [https://particl.news/part-usdt-listed-on-mexc/]\n * Large number of updates to BasicSwap's codebase and GUI\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commits/master/]\n * Particl and BasicSwap join the PFS\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-joins-pfs/]\n * BasicSwap DEX Installer for Windows\n   [https://github.com/gerlofvanek/basicswap-installation-GUI/releases/]\n * Talks at Monerokon (2023\n   [https://particl.news/monerokon-2023-presentation-kewde/] and 2024\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-dex-at-monerokon-2024/])\n * Litecoin MWEB balances added to BasicSwap\n   [https://particl.news/litecoin-mweb-balances-and-conversions-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n * BasicSwap on stage at the 2024 Litecoin Summit\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-dex-to-present-at-litecoin-summit-2024/]\n * Decred added to BasicSwap\n   [https://particl.news/decred-now-available-on-basicswap-dex/]\n * Wownero added to BasicSwap\n   [https://particl.news/wownero-now-available-on-basicswap-dex/]\n\nOngoing Initiatives and Current Priorities\nEmbracing New Opportunities with BasicSwap\nWhile we recently encountered challenges in the development of Particl\nMarketplace, notably in terms of developer availability, these obstacles have\nled us to devote more time and effort towards BasicSwap. This strategic pivot\nhas allowed us to make significant progress to the DEX, bringing BasicSwap to a\nlevel of maturity that opens up new possibilities for integration, adoption, and\necosystem revenue.\n\nWith this in mind, our current short-to-medium term goal is to keep on improving\nthe DEX's codebase and develop an integration layer that will allow\nBasicSwap-powered swap services to be seamlessly incorporated into third-party\napplications such as mobile wallets, web platforms, and other services. These\nefforts not only seek to improve BasicSwap's accessibility, usability, and\nutility, but also align with our adaptive funding strategy in light of recent\nPART price fluctuations.\n\nInnovative Funding Strategies\nThe recent market dynamics have presented challenges for the team, but they've\nalso sparked innovation in our funding approach which we're very excited about.\n\nIndeed, we're currently actively exploring various opportunities to monetize\nBasicSwap-powered services in ways that directly benefit the Particl community,\nwithout introducing any sort of compromises to the core principles of the DEX\n(decentralization, non-custodianship, privacy, freedom, etc).\n\nOur immediate focus is on developing mutually beneficial partnerships for\nBasicSwap integrations. As a result, these collaborations could yield non-PART\ndonations to support the team, while also allowing the implementation of various\nstrategies that would increase the demand for PART — either via coin burning,\nexternal revenue deposited into the network treasury, or other similar\nmechanisms.\n\nIn other words, these recent efforts aim at providing the ecosystem and its\ncontributors with a steady stream of revenue, providing a sustainable\nenvironment that allows for healthier growth of PART, its pool of contributors,\nand the project as a whole.\n\nIt's important to note, however, that we remain fully committed to keeping the\nBasicSwap protocol free and open. Our monetization efforts are solely targeted\nat third-party integrations, creating a mutually beneficial scenario for both\nthe community and our partners.\n\nDiversifying Funding Sources\nWe're also making strides in securing non-PART donations from communities that\nshare our vision and/or want to be integrated into BasicSwap.\n\nFor instance, one of our beloved community contributors, Ofrnxmr, has recently\nsubmitted a CCS proposal\n[https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/ofrnxmr_basicswap.html] to the Monero\ncommunity that got funded, and we've also received a donation\n[https://proposals.decred.org/record/0757fea] from the Decred community\nfollowing our successful integration of their coin into BasicSwap.\n\nThese initiatives are part of our broader strategy to achieve full\nself-sustainability and reduce — or, in the best of cases, completely eliminate\n— our reliance on the network treasury over time while improving our products\nfor the benefit of all.\n\nThe Funding Request in Detail\n * Funding request: 35,250 PART (monthly)\n * Duration: 6 months\n\nThese upcoming changes are the reason we are proposing a shorter team funding\ncycle this time around.\n\nIndeed, this proposal [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/24] seeks a\nmonthly allocation of 35,250 PART from the Treasury Fund for a 6-month period.\nThis funding will support the Particl team and fuel our operations as we work\ntowards our goals of integration and self-sustainability.\n\nWe've opted for a 6-month funding request in order to provide stability for our\ncurrent projects as we develop new ecosystem revenue streams while allowing\nflexibility for potential external funding opportunities and team expansion. \nThis timeframe also gives our community the chance to discuss and propose\nmodifications to the treasury model and coin emission rate.\n\nFund Allocation\nGiven the current PART price, the funds requested in this proposal are primarily\nallocated to fund the ongoing development cycle at the current pace, as well as\ncover various operational expenses.\n\nShould the PART price and liquidity improve, any additional coins will be\naccumulated in the team’s reserves to be directed towards financing a variety of\nmarketing, communications, community, and outreach efforts to support the\necosystem and its dApps.\n\n> Note: All funds voted to be allocated to the Particl team are held and managed\nby SoonTM Development Ltd, an independent software development company.\nAcknowledging Community Discussions on Treasury and Emission\nWe're aware of the ongoing community discussions regarding potential changes to\nthe treasury system, its parameters, and/or the blockchain's coin emission rate.\nThese conversations are crucial for the long-term sustainability and health of\nthe Particl ecosystem, and we strongly encourage their continuation.\n\nOur decision to request funding for a shorter 6-month period, as opposed to a\n12-month period as was the case with previous proposals, aligns directly with\nthese discussions. It provides the flexibility needed to pursue our new funding\nstrategy and adapt to any potential changes that may arise from community-driven\nproposals. We believe that this shorter claim period strikes a healthy balance\nbetween ensuring the continued, uninterrupted development of Particl and\nremaining responsive to the evolving needs and decisions of the community.\n\nHow to Vote\nWe encourage all stakeholders to participate in this crucial decision-making\nprocess. To cast your vote on proposal #24\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/24], we recommend using the\npartyman cold staking application to register your vote on the blockchain.\n\nYou have three options:\n\n * Abstain (0)\n * Vote in favor (1)\n * Vote against (2)\n\nEvery vote counts! Higher participation ensures a broader consensus and a\nhealthier decision-making process for our entire community.\n\n * To learn more about Particl's on-chain voting system, click here\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-blockchain/blockchain_dao.html]\n   .\n * To learn how to vote, refer to this tutorial\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/part-guides/partguides_voting.html].\n\n> Important: For the proposal [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/19] \nto show up on Partyman, make sure you are running its latest version. To do so, \nrun git pull from inside your partyman folder, and then type the ./partyman\nupdate command from that same partyman folder.\nLooking Ahead: A Bright Future for Particl\nThe challenges we've faced recently have only strengthened our resolve and led\nus towards innovative solutions that will benefit our entire ecosystem.\n\nOur focus on BasicSwap integration, coupled with our efforts to diversify\nfunding and optimize our economic model, sets the stage for a resurgence of\nParticl and a renewed growth, much like the phoenix reborn from its ashes. As we\nwork on this new approach, we are confident in its potential to create\nself-sustaining ecosystem revenue that not only weathers market fluctuations,\nbut even thrives in the face of them.\n\nThat is why we invite you to join us in supporting this new funding request.\nYour participation in the voting process, your feedback, and your continued\nsupport are the driving forces behind Particl's success and the reason we keep\ndoing what we do.\n\nThank you for your ongoing support and commitment to the Particl project.

This strategic pivot has allowed us to make significant progress to the DEX, bringing BasicSwap to a level of maturity that opens up new possibilities for integration, adoption, and ecosystem revenue.</p><p>With this in mind, our current short-to-medium term goal is to keep on improving the DEX's codebase and develop an integration layer that will allow BasicSwap-powered swap services to be seamlessly incorporated into third-party applications such as mobile wallets, web platforms, and other services. These efforts not only seek to improve BasicSwap's accessibility, usability, and utility, but also align with our adaptive funding strategy in light of recent PART price fluctuations.</p><h3 id=\"innovative-funding-strategies\"><strong>Innovative Funding Strategies</strong></h3><p>The recent market dynamics have presented challenges for the team, but they've also sparked innovation in our funding approach which we're very excited about.</p><p>Indeed, we're currently actively exploring various opportunities to monetize BasicSwap-powered services in ways that directly benefit the Particl community, without introducing any sort of compromises to the core principles of the DEX (decentralization, non-custodianship, privacy, freedom, etc).</p><p>Our immediate focus is on developing mutually beneficial partnerships for BasicSwap integrations. As a result, these collaborations could yield non-PART donations to support the team, while also allowing the implementation of various strategies that would increase the demand for PART — either via coin burning, external revenue deposited into the network treasury, or other similar mechanisms.</p><p>In other words, these recent efforts aim at providing the ecosystem and its contributors with a steady stream of revenue, providing a sustainable environment that allows for healthier growth of PART, its pool of contributors, and the project as a whole.</p><p><strong>It's important to note, however, that we remain fully committed to keeping the BasicSwap protocol free and open. Our monetization efforts are solely targeted at third-party integrations, creating a mutually beneficial scenario for both the community and our partners.</strong></p><h3 id=\"diversifying-funding-sources\"><strong>Diversifying Funding Sources</strong></h3><p>We're also making strides in securing non-PART donations from communities that share our vision and/or want to be integrated into BasicSwap.</p><p>For instance, one of our beloved community contributors, Ofrnxmr, has recently submitted a <a href=\"https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/ofrnxmr_basicswap.html\">CCS proposal</a> to the Monero community that got funded, and we've also <a href=\"https://proposals.decred.org/record/0757fea\">received a donation</a> from the Decred community following our successful integration of their coin into BasicSwap.</p><p>These initiatives are part of our broader strategy to achieve full self-sustainability and reduce — or, in the best of cases, completely eliminate — our reliance on the network treasury over time while improving our products for the benefit of all.</p><h2 id=\"the-funding-request-in-detail\"><strong>The Funding Request in Detail</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Funding request:</strong> 35,250 PART (monthly)</li><li><strong>Duration:</strong> 6 months</li></ul><p>These upcoming changes are the reason we are proposing a shorter team funding cycle this time around.</p><p>Indeed, <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/24\">this proposal</a> seeks a monthly allocation of <strong>35,250 PART from the Treasury Fund for a 6-month period</strong>. This funding will support the Particl team and fuel our operations as we work towards our goals of integration and self-sustainability.</p><p>We've opted for a 6-month funding request in order to provide stability for our current projects as we develop new ecosystem revenue streams while allowing flexibility for potential external funding opportunities and team expansion. <strong>This timeframe also gives our community the chance to discuss and propose modifications to the treasury model and coin emission rate.</strong></p><h3 id=\"fund-allocation\"><strong>Fund Allocation</strong></h3><p>Given the current PART price, the funds requested in this proposal are primarily allocated to fund the ongoing development cycle at the current pace, as well as cover various operational expenses.</p><p>Should the PART price and liquidity improve, any additional coins will be accumulated in the team’s reserves to be directed towards financing a variety of marketing, communications, community, and outreach efforts to support the ecosystem and its dApps.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> All funds voted to be allocated to the Particl team are held and managed by SoonTM Development Ltd, an independent software development company.</em></blockquote><h3 id=\"acknowledging-community-discussions-on-treasury-and-emission\"><strong>Acknowledging Community Discussions on Treasury and Emission</strong></h3><p>We're aware of the ongoing community discussions regarding potential changes to the treasury system, its parameters, and/or the blockchain's coin emission rate. These conversations are crucial for the long-term sustainability and health of the Particl ecosystem, and we strongly encourage their continuation.</p><p>Our decision to request funding for a shorter 6-month period, as opposed to a 12-month period as was the case with previous proposals, aligns directly with these discussions. It provides the flexibility needed to pursue our new funding strategy and adapt to any potential changes that may arise from community-driven proposals.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase.
