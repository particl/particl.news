This week has\nbeen a happy one with the release of the new Particl V3 testnet builds. And so,\nmost of the work on the desktop side of things has been about dealing with\nquestions, assisting, and investigating (and fixing) more minor issues that have\nall come from the community.\n\nStatus of the Current Testnet Round\nWe're excited to announce that, as of yet, nothing significant has been reported\nin terms of blockers that may prevent a mainnet release. The only issue that may\nneed some attention is related to some performance-related concerns that have\nbeen reported on the private-by-default Whonix OS. However, we do not foresee\nany delay caused by this problem as it is relatively minor and straightforward\nto fix. \n\nAdditionally, we'd like to take at least one more week of testing before\ninitiating the process of releasing Particl V3 on mainnet. That's to allow more\ntime for edge-case testing and make sure no new bug is found in the coming days.\n\nAs such, assuming no new issue is found in the days to come, we will be ready to\nannounce Particl V3's mainnet release date next week!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Development Report\nAside from looking into smaller issues and inquiries regarding the current\nParticl V3 testnet round (that you can track here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues]), work has begun towards\nplanning out the next updates and additions for Particl Desktop moving forward\n(based on items from the new roadmap). So, if nothing new regarding the current\ntestnet requires attention, we'll start working next week on the changes planned\nfor the v3.1 release, but also possibly future v3.2 and v3.3 releases as well.\n\nOne useful addition to Particl V3 since the launch of the current testnet round\nis the ability to split UTXOs for public transactions as well (not just anon\ntransactions). The issue was reported by community member Kangoala; thanks for\npointing it out! You can read more about it here: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues/1813\n\nParticl Core Development Report\nOn the Particl Core side of things, we are happy to report that testing has\nresumed on BasicSwap with the closed beta group and that a few changes have been\nmade to the protocol. Much more details regarding BasicSwap coming right after\nthe release of Particl V3 on mainnet. \n\nWe're also excited to tease you by announcing that a new lightwallet client to\neasily store and use PART will join the Particl ecosystem very soon. Indeed, we\ncan report that, today, the first successful mainnet transaction using Particl\nElectrum has been made! \n\n * First Particl Electrum transaction on mainnet: \n   https://explorer.particl.io/tx/36949d5e5ea43b590cf4d20ac31662bc4890197fde77c0d185b46985ac5275e5\n\nParticl Electrum will play an important part for some of the things we have\nplanned ahead. Notably, the lightwallet provides \"light services\" that can be\nused to provide other Particl apps with an access to the blockchain without\nsyncing it entirely. It also provides for an easy way to use the Lightning\nNetwork through a built-in interface, although converting that code to Particl\nis still in progress. \n\nWe will provide more details about Particl Electrum and explain how it fits into\nthe broader Particl ecosystem as we move forward with our post-V3 strategic\nroadmap! \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you again for your support and passion for the project's mission. Exciting\ntimes are ahead, and while we encourage you to keep testing the current testnet\nversion of Particl V3, we certainly look forward to announcing the mainnet\nrelease date. \n\nWe'll be publishing more information next week regarding the mainnet launch of\nParticl V3 and will, at the same time, communicate a few things coming right\nafter or around this event. You can also expect the new roadmap to go live very\nshortly after Particl V3's mainnet launch. \n\nStay tuned and have a great weekend!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This list is not exhaustive, it does not\ninclude some of the smaller and/or less impactful fixes.\n\nGovernance Module\n * Enable the governance module for testing.\n * Fixed an issue where graphs were not displaying in release builds.\n\nMarket Module\n * Publishing fee estimates now correctly include the image fees.\n * Filtering for expired listings in Sell > Listings page now works correctly.\n * A warning is now displayed when there may be insufficient utxos (but\n   sufficient total funds) to publish a listing AND all its images. The ability\n   to still continue with the publish is possible, but requires the seller to\n   explicitly indicate that this is acceptable.\n * Updated the csv product import functionality to attempt to match on country\n   name (English only for now) instead of just the ISO code.\n * The csv product import now allows for specifying the \"shipping to\"\n   destinations countries in a comma separated list.\n * The market summary text of a market shown in the Joined Markets section is\n   now selectable.\n * Includes changes made to particl-marketplace service such as...\n * Fixed an error that prevented a bid from being placed if all the images of\n   the item in question had not been properly received.\n * Fixed an error that caused the buyflow to become stuck due to the buyer\n   cancelling the purchase arrangement but the seller completing the escrow\n   state prior to receiving the cancellation action.\n * The particl-marketplace service now has some time on termination to attempt\n   to gracefully shut itself down, instead of terminating processing immediately\n   (and potentially causing issues with the processing of messages).\n * Remove the lookup for an existing \"market\" named wallet to create the initial\n   profile/identity wallets from when initializing the service for the first\n   time: this potentially causes errors and requires manual user intervention if\n   the named \"market\" wallet is encrypted and locked during the service\n   initialization.\n\nWallet Module\n * Updated the zap functionality (cold staking) to cater to additional user\n   options.\n * Changed wording on the transaction table entries to make more sense when fees\n   are involved: this includes fees paid for smsg fees (eg: publishing listings\n   via smsg) and zap transaction fees.\n * The restore wallet flow now caters to 12 word mnemonic inputs.\n\nGeneral\n * Added additional messages to message of the day.\n * Spelling and other grammar updates.\n * Update and unify usage of the zmq library dependency.\n * Application crashes should now be handled correctly: instead of receiving a\n   nasty JS error prompt, the error is logged and a friendlier window is\n   displayed indicating that the application has crashed. This is a temporary\n   stopgap change that leads into better logging and user visibility into what\n   the application is doing.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you for your support and assistance in testing this new version of Particl\nV3.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nMulti-Net Support ?\nMultinet by tecnovert · Pull Request #311 · basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
