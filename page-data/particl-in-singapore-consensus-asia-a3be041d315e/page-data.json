This release has been a historic moment for the project and\na huge stepping stone for the upcoming eCommerce revolution that Particl is\nbrewing up.\n\nParticl’s Open Marketplace Live on Mainnet ?Since that time, the team has\ncertainly not been taking it slow. No, it’s instead been carefully monitoring\nthe community for feedback and comments regarding the overall user experience of\nthis first live version of the marketplace and has started working on several\nfeatures that are soon going to make their way onto the marketplace. It’s\nimportant to remind ourselves that this version of the Open Marketplace is an\nearly Beta version and is in no way the “end” of anything for Particl. Quite to\nthe contrary, it is the beginning of a great journey in disrupting one of the\nbiggest economic sector of the world— the eCommerce sector.\n\nIt’s been mentioned in the past that, as the Open Marketplace goes live on\nmainnet, it would signify a gradual change of phase for the project. Whereas\nParticl used to be almost exclusively focused on development, getting a live\nproduct means user adoption will now play a more important role. After all, this\nproject has always been about building a product that people could use to\naddress real-world issues. It has always been about creating a solution that\nempowers individuals and enables businesses to reach their full potential. And\nnow that the solution is here, it’s time to get people to use it and benefit\nfrom its groundbreaking technology.\n\nNow it’s Adoption Time!\nEver since the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace, the Particl team has\nreceived a huge amount of feedback and comments about the overall user\nexperience. And it is this user experience, the feeling you get when using the\nmarketplace, that is critical in getting new people and businesses to use\nParticl. It is one of the key factors in determining the “user conversion rate”,\nor the number of people that become recurring users after trying out the\nmarketplace for the first time.\n\nIndeed, getting new people to try out the marketplace is one thing, but\nretaining them as users is a whole other story. Most of the time, people are\nmore than willing to sacrifice their data and even pay higher prices if the user\nexperience is better elsewhere. And besides, you also get one chance at first\nimpressions.\n\nFor this reason, the new Open Marketplace development roadmap will now be\nheavily focused on building what needs to be done to make the user experience as\ngood and as accessible as possible. In other words, each new marketplace feature\nreleased within the next few weeks and months will directly contribute in making\nthe user experience better, thus increasing the user conversion rate and\nallowing more sellers and buyers to be onboarded.\n\nWhat are the Current Barriers to Entry\nSince the ultimate goal of the Open Marketplace is to empower individuals and\nbusinesses on a global scale, it’s important to identify what are the current\nbarriers to entry for anyone to start using the marketplace. After that, it’s\ncrucial to identify what can be done about it and then act on it.\n\nBy definition, a barrier to entry is an obstacle or hindrance that makes it hard\nto adopt a new product. This obstacle can be a technological challenge,\ndifficult government regulations, a steep financial cost, a lack of education\nabout a topic, and etc. In the Open Marketplace’s case, the barriers to entry\nare mostly technological, financial, and educational.\n\nThat much is made quite obvious when you start to go over the list of the most\nreported issues, comments, and feedback regarding the user experience of the\nmarketplace since it’s been released on mainnet. When all summarized, most of it\ncan be boiled down to a few main barriers to entry that makes it a bit\nchallenging for buyers and sellers to adopt the platform. Some of the most\nreported user experience issues include:\n\n * The setup process of the marketplace (it has to be manually enabled) could be\n   improved (technological barrier)\n * Listing fees being too high for large-scale sellers (financial barrier)\n * The double deposit MAD escrow requires a security deposit from both sides \n   (financial barrier)\n * There is no branding or identification option for vendors (technological\n   barrier)\n * The marketplace currently only accepts the PART coin and not Bitcoin, other\n   cryptocurrencies, or more traditional means of payment (technological\n   barrier)\n * The entire blockchain and SMSG network needs to be synced, which takes a few\n   minutes to do (technological barrier)\n * What needs to be done to complete a certain action isn’t always perfectly\n   clear (educational barrier)\n * How funds move throughout a full transaction process (educational barrier)\n\nThese barriers to entry are the main obstacles that make it harder for Particl\nto be adopted to a wider level. As such, solutions to these issues will be\nprioritized moving forward, and each item contained within the Open Marketplace\ndevelopment roadmap for the next few months is designed to increase the adoption\nof the Open Marketplace by improving the user experience.\n\nMake Particl as Accessible as Any Other Marketplace\nTo eliminate the barriers that make the Open Marketplace hard to adopt for most\npeople, the Particl team has planned and started working on several improvements\nand features. Each of them is designed to feed off each other and directly\ncontribute to improving Particl’s user experience for both buyers and sellers.\n\nWhat follows is an estimated release timeline of the next few features that are\ngoing to make their way onto Particl’s Open Marketplace. There’s currently no\ndate or time estimate associated with any of these features, but they’re what’s\nbeing worked on at this moment and what is planned to be released in the short\nto mid-term.\n\n> Note: This development timeline is only an estimation of the order at which\nfeatures will be released live on mainnet. All listed items are subject to\nchange.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Coming Up for Particl?\n * User Interface Tweaks\n * Lowering Marketplace Fees\n * Product Import Tool (1)\n * Q&A Section — Ask a Question to a Seller (2)\n * Particl Desktop Settings Page (3)\n * Market Management Tool (4)\n * Adjustable Escrow Ratio (5)\n * Inventory and Quantity Management Tool (6)\n * Then What?\n   Alternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments\n   Mobile Application\n   Developer SDK Tools\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUser Interface Tweaks\nImproved Sell Orders Page (Work-in-Progress)The lowest hanging fruit for\nimpoving Particl’s user experience is by making several tweaks to the user\ninterface of Particl Desktop, the client on which the Open Marketplace is\nhosted. These tweaks are currently being worked on based on user feedback and\nwill make using Particl much easier, especially for those who haven’t used it in\nthe past. These improvements and additions will also display more information to\nbuyers and sellers, making it easier to track what’s happening within the client\n(i.e. why funds are moving around, or at what time has a certain transaction\nbeen locked into escrow, and etc).\n\nLowering Marketplace Fees\nOne of the most reported issue with the Open Marketplace is the cost of listing\nan item. As the marketplace is fully autonomous and isn’t being operated by any\nthird-party, it charges no commission, subscription, payment processing, or\nescrow fee at all. It does, however, charge a small listing fee to fight off\nspam on the network.\n\nIn fact, when listing an item, the network usually charges sellers with a few\ncents worth of PART every day. And while it isn’t that big of a deal for any\nseller making a few sales here and there on their listings, especially given the\nfact that no commission is being charged on top of sales, it can quickly add up\nfor some of the smaller scale vendors who struggle to make sales and sellers\nwith huge inventories (hundreds/thousands of listings).\n\nAdjusting Marketplace Listing Fees on the Partyman AppFortunately, you can\nactually contribute to making this listing fee smaller. The Particl team has\npublished on their blog a full tutorial\n[https://particl.news/adjusting-listing-fees-4b676e230601] on how to instruct\nyour staking node to broadcast a request for lower fees to the SMSG network.\nSMSG is the network on which marketplace-related content is published and\nhosted.\n\nAdditionally, the Particl team is in the process of improving and optimizing the\nSMSG network. It is estimated that the marketplace fees (i.e. listing fees) will\nsignificantly be lowered due to the more effective SMSG codebase.\n\nThese changes will come gradually within the Beta phase of development of the\nmarketplace as updates get pushed.\n\nProduct Import Tool\nProduct Import Tool (Work-in-Progress)One of the key components of a two-sided\nmarketplace is getting a good amount of sellers and listed products. This is why\nthe new Particl Open Marketplace roadmap for the next few months includes a lot\nof tools that will make it easier for sellers to adopt the platform.\n\nOne such tool is the Product Import tool. This tool allows vendors to quickly\nimport large inventories from other sources, considerably reducing the time it\ntakes to populate the marketplace when holding custody of large inventories.\nWithout this feature, sellers need to manually add listings one by one, which is\na very time-consuming process.\n\nWith this feature in place, sellers are going to be able to import and list\nlarge inventories with only a few clicks. Outside sources for inventory\nimportation will include WooCommerce stores and CSV files (spreadsheets). More\noptions are very likely to be added in the future.\n\nQ&A Section — Ask a Question to a Seller\nBut a two-sided marketplace being a two-sided marketplace, it also needs a good\namount of buyers so that it can reach its full potential. This is where the\nupcoming Q&A section comes into play.\n\nThis “comment section” will allow anyone to ask questions to vendors before\npurchasing (or flagging) a product. This isn’t unlike the very popular Q&A\nsection that Amazon has had for some time now, and it goes a great way into\ngiving you information that might be missing from the item’s description.\n\nThis feature, while not a direct line of contact with the seller, will help\nbuyers make more informed purchasing decisions and give a little bit more\nconfidence when buying an item from a complete stranger. The more you know, the\nbetter decisions one can make.\n\nParticl Desktop Settings Page\nThe Particl Desktop Settings page is a no-brainer. Currently, if you want to\nchange a configuration on your Particl Desktop client, you either have to modify\nsome config file or enter some command inside the console. This works, but since\nthe goal is to make Particl’s user experience as good as possible, it’s\ndefinitely not as user-friendly as it should be.\n\nThe Settings page is pretty much what you would expect from a…settings page. It\nallows you to change various preferences without having to go through the hassle\nof finding a tutorial on how to find and modify a config file, or find a list of\ncommands to enter in the console.\n\nMarket Management Tool\nThe Market Management tool is one of the most awaited features of the Open\nMarketplace, and rightly so. It is what’s going to make all the individual\npieces of the marketplace click together and form into a giant distributed\nnetwork of markets.\n\nSelect What Market (or Storefront) to Browse (Work-in-Progress)Market Management\nwill allow you to either create a market of your own or connect your client to a\npre-existing one. These community markets can be created by anyone and are\ncompletely independent of the main interface of the Open Marketplace. In fact,\nthey are powered by completely different sets of market keys, meaning no data\ncan be shared between the different markets. It’s like multi-wallets, but more\nadvanced and for markets.\n\nOn Particl, there are two types of markets: community markets, and storefronts.\n\nCommunity Markets: They are markets on which anyone that has access to it can\nbuy or sell goods and services. They function exactly the same as the main\ninterface of the Open Marketplace, and nobody has any special permission over\nother users. Not even the market creator. These markets, however, are not\nenabled nor visible by default. To access these markets, you need to connect\nyour Particl Desktop client to its Market ID.\n\n> Note: The main interface of the Open Marketplace is a community market that’s\nenabled and displayed by default by the Particl Desktop client.\nJoined Markets (and Storefronts) Page (Work-in-Progress)Storefronts: They are customizable community markets on which special\npermissions can be attributed to various users. In their most common sense, they\nare storefronts on which a seller can “set up a shop” in such a way that only\nhim (or the people he gives administrator rights to) can publish listings.\nAnyone with access to a storefront can only buy (or flag) the listings put on\nthere by the owner of the storefront. Storefronts can also be used by\ncommunities looking for higher standards in quality on which only vetted sellers\ncould publish listings.\n\n> Note: By default, Particl Desktop has no way to automatically find Market IDs on\nthe network. These keys need to be distributed manually by whoever wants people\nto interact with a certain market or storefront…unless these markets/storefronts\nget promoted.\nPromote a Market or Storefront (Work-in-Progress)While Particl Desktop cannot\nautomatically scan and detect community markets, it is still possible to promote\nyour market to the network, for a fee. When “promoting” your market (or\nstorefront), your Particl Desktop client broadcasts the Market ID of your market\nto the network using SMSG. It is then picked up by the other clients connected\nto the Particl network, and is added to a “market browser”. At this point, a\nmarket will act just like a listing. It will show up on the market browser for\nthe amount of time it’s been promoted. Once the promotion period ends, the\nmarket disappears from the market browser.\n\n> Note: Once a market or storefront disappears from the market browser, it is\nstill accessible to anyone with its Market ID. The only difference is that it\nwon’t be publicly accessible from the market browser itself.\nAnyone with the proper Market IDs of a market or storefront can promote it. All\nthe fees paid to bump/promote community markets are, just like the listing fees,\nredistributed to stakers.\n\nCreate a New Storefront With Logo (Work-in-Progress)Storefronts are ideal for\nsellers with an already established reputation. It allows them to guarantee to\ntheir customer base that a given market, thus all products published inside of\nit, belongs to him. This can easily be done by, for example, displaying the\nMarket ID of the storefront on the seller’s official website.\n\nAdditionally, storefronts allow for a minimal amount of customization/branding\n(logo, store description, store title) and aggregate all the listings of a\nvendor to a single point of access This makes it easier and quicker for\ncustomers to find what they’re looking for, when they need it.\n\nAdjustable Escrow Ratio\nAs it stands right now, Particl’s double deposit MAD escrow system only works\nusing a 100% ratio, meaning both parties need to deposit a security deposit\nequal to 100% of the value of the item or service being purchased. There’s\nnothing wrong with that, of course. After all, a 100% ratio does provide the\nbest game-theory for this type of escrow. There might, however, be some\ncircumstances where such an escrow system wouldn’t be ideal.\n\nTake the example of a well-known seller that’s already trusted by its customer\nbase and runs a storefront on Particl. This seller might want to move some of\nits inventory on Particl to save on fees and improve the level of privacy for\nhis business as well as his customers. But since that seller is already\nwell-known and has an established customer base, it might not be ideal for both\nthe seller and its customer to front funds in order to cover a double deposit\nMAD escrow smart-contract. There is already trust that’s been established\nbetween the two parties and, since the seller is running a Particl storefront,\nhe can prove ownership of the products being offered simply by spreading his\nMarket ID on his website or social media pages. In that situation, the required\nsecurity deposits become an unnecessary obstacle for both the seller and the\nbuyer as they do not necessarily require, or want, escrow protection for\ntransactions.\n\nWhat an adjustable escrow would mean is that vendors could set up their own\nescrow ratio preferences from 0% to 100%. In the above example of a well-known\nseller running a Particl storefront, he could just reduce his escrow ratio to\n0%, meaning no security deposit would be required from neither the buyer or the\nvendor. This, of course, means that buyers would have no recourse against a\ndishonest seller, but for those already-established sellers with an existing\ncustomer base, having the opportunity to not have to advance coins to fund the\nescrow system would make adopting Particl’s Open Marketplace much more of a\nno-brainer.\n\nInventory and Quantity Management Tool\nThis feature is self-explanatory. There is no way, currently, to manage a wide\ninventory and add quantities to your listing. Fortunately, the marketplace\nback-end currently allows for most of it, but it hasn’t been integrated into the\nOpen Marketplace just yet. Note that a relatively fair amount of development is\nstill needed around this feature and it is likely to be released after the\nMarket Management tool.\n\nThis tool, like its name implies, allows vendors to easily manage inventory\nquantities, manage multiple listings, and etc. Just like the Product Import\ntool, Inventory Management is going to make it way easier for sellers with large\ninventories to take the leap and get started selling on Particl without it being\na big hassle.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThen What?\nAll of the above-mentioned items are placed into a short to mid-term roadmap,\nmeaning they are likely to be released within the next few weeks and months,\ndepending on the feature. But wait, there’s more to it!\n\nThe Particl team is thinking ahead and has already planned and started doing\nresearch on the features that are going to be worked on once the above\nmarketplace development roadmap is completed.\n\nAlternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments\nOne of the barriers to entry for Particl’s Open Marketplace currently is that it\nonly works with PART, Particl’s native privacy coin. This, of course, is due to\nthe nature of the technology and how the marketplace has to use PART for its\nprivacy and smart-contract capabilities\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd]. If it\nwere using Bitcoin, not only would transactions take a considerably longer time\ndue to longer confirmations, but the marketplace wouldn’t be able to offer a\nprivate-by-default experience to its users. And if it were using Monero, it\nwould be okay on the privacy side of things, but then the coin couldn’t be used\nwithin smart-contracts. The PART coin is a next-generation privacy coin that\nhas\nboth a solid privacy scheme and a flexible codebase\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd] which\nallows it to be used within smart-contracts. As far as privacy coins come, it’s\npretty much getting your cake and eating it too! The good stuff…without the\nlimitations.\n\nBut in the end, people want an easy-to-use marketplace with good user\nexperience, and only accepting PART severely limits the number of new users that\ncan be onboarded (that’s because everybody uses Bitcoin, mostly). To address\nthis issue, the Particl team is going to be working on integrating alternative\nmethods of payments, like paying with Bitcoin, for example.\n\nThere are a couple of ways this can be done, either through an atomic swap\nwidget or by integrating a third-party partner. And while the Particl team would\nlike to use an atomic swap solution (research and development on the matter is\nongoing at this very moment), a third-party integration might have to be coded\nin until an atomic swap application is fully ready (and thoroughly tested) to\ngo. There are currently investigations going into this question specifically,\nand so more details will be able to be communicated in the future.\n\nIt’s important to note though that, regardless of the method chosen to accept\ndifferent payment methods, the PART coin will always be the coin that settles\nthe transaction in the end. That’s because even though Particl’s Open\nMarketplace would be accepting Bitcoin, the marketplace Dapp still needs PART to\noperate as it is the coin that gives it its privacy and smart-contract\ncapabilities. This means any non-PART payments will be automatically converted\ninto a PART transaction, in the background, on behalf of the user. The end\nresult is that the buyer pays with Bitcoin, and the Open Marketplace does all\nthe rest, transferring the Bitcoin into Particl to fuel the escrow contract.\n\nMobile Application\nAnother very important upcoming feature is a Particl Open Marketplace mobile\napplication. Indeed, most people now shop on their cellphones, which means\ndownloading a software that requires you to sync two networks (blockchain +\nSMSG) is definitely a downgrade in terms of user experience. Sure, it provides\nway better privacy and decentralization, but for most people, this is too weak\nof an argument against a lazy and fast user-experience.\n\nAnd so, to address this issue, the Particl team has scheduled the development of\na mobile application. Research is already being put into this item at this very\nmoment, although it is not a top priority for the team right now. That’s because\nthere are still some core features missing to the marketplace (the items in the\nabove roadmap) that need to be added before the team can think of wrapping\neverything within a mobile application. Once the above roadmap is complete or\nnear-complete, that’s when the Open Marketplace’s mobile application is going to\nbecome more of a focus.\n\nThis mobile application will make Particl as accessible as it will have ever\nbeen. In fact, most of the world uses cellphones and more and more people now\nspend more time on their phone than on their computer. To make sure the\napplication has good performance and setup speed, it is more than likely to be a\n“light wallet”, meaning it won’t require you to download the entire blockchain\nand SMSG network to function. In other words, this application is intended to be\nas easy to use as any traditional marketplace mobile application (i.e. Amazon’s\napplication).\n\nDeveloper SDK Tools\nWith bringing more people within the Particl ecosystem in mind, the team has\nplanned for the release of an SDK tool. This tool will be accompanied by various\ntechnical documentation that is now currently missing. This will allow outside\ndevelopers and teams to easily start contributing to the Particl network by\ndeveloping services, decentralized applications, marketplace features, and etc.\n\nBecause the Open Marketplace is still very much into a heavy development phase,\nthis SDK tool is likely to be one of the last items of this article to see the\nday. With this in mind, the SDK tool will be going live once the Particl code\ngets “stable enough” so that it makes sense to commit to a version and write\ndocumentation on it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet’s Wrap it Up\nAll of the above-mentioned features that are going to be added to Particl have\none thing in common — they are part of a bigger puzzle that’s gonna make the\nOpen Marketplace much more accessible and easy to use for everyone. They all\ncontribute to eliminate the current barriers to entry that makes adopting\nParticl more complicated for most people.\n\nOnce in place, these should take Particl to the next level, making it a much\nmore credible contender for mainstream adoption. In the meantime, Particl\npioneers such as you can still buy and sell anything for crypto, without leaving\na trace, using the current version of the Open Marketplace. And since the\nmarketplace is now live on mainnet, new features and improvements can be\nexpected to come out at an accelerated pace!\n\nParticl is now well on its way on the path towards mainstream adoption. The\ndevelopment team is now a well-oiled machine and is excited to enter this new\nphase for the Particl project. The base layer is there, now it’s all about\nputting the last pieces to the puzzle together. This is where it gets exciting\nand when it starts moving faster!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-r41YvsRXOJyeVDkN_GcTqg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"new-marketplace-development-update-roadmap\">New Marketplace Development Update &amp; Roadmap</h3><p>It has now been more than 2 weeks since the Particl Open Marketplace has launched on mainnet. This release has been a historic moment for the project and a huge stepping stone for the upcoming eCommerce revolution that Particl is brewing up.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-QjorfnMkAgAxEXVbGdPndw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl’s Open Marketplace Live on Mainnet ?</figcaption></figure><p>Since that time, the team has certainly not been taking it slow. No, it’s instead been carefully monitoring the community for feedback and comments regarding the overall user experience of this first live version of the marketplace and has started working on several features that are soon going to make their way onto the marketplace. It’s important to remind ourselves that this version of the Open Marketplace is an early Beta version and is in no way the “end” of anything for Particl. Quite to the contrary, it is the beginning of a great journey in disrupting one of the biggest economic sector of the world— the eCommerce sector.</p><p>It’s been mentioned in the past that, as the Open Marketplace goes live on mainnet, it would signify a gradual change of phase for the project. Whereas Particl used to be almost exclusively focused on development, getting a live product means user adoption will now play a more important role. After all, this project has always been about building a product that people could use to address <strong>real-world issues. </strong>It has always been about creating a solution that empowers individuals and enables businesses to reach their full potential. And now that the solution is here, it’s time to get people to use it and benefit from its groundbreaking technology.</p><h2 id=\"now-it-s-adoption-time-\">Now it’s Adoption Time!</h2><p>Ever since the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace, the Particl team has received a huge amount of feedback and comments about the overall user experience. And it is this user experience, the feeling you get when using the marketplace, that is critical in getting new people and businesses to use Particl. It is one of the key factors in determining the “user conversion rate”, or the number of people that become recurring users after trying out the marketplace for the first time.</p><p>Indeed, getting new people to try out the marketplace is one thing, but retaining them as users is a whole other story. Most of the time, people are more than willing to sacrifice their data and even pay higher prices if the user experience is better elsewhere. And besides, you also get one chance at first impressions.</p><p>For this reason, <strong>the new Open Marketplace development roadmap will now be heavily focused on building what needs to be done to make the user experience as good and as accessible as possible. </strong>In other words, each new marketplace feature released within the next few weeks and months will directly contribute in making the user experience better, thus increasing the user conversion rate and allowing more sellers and buyers to be onboarded.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-current-barriers-to-entry\">What are the Current Barriers to Entry</h2><p>Since the ultimate goal of the Open Marketplace is to empower individuals and businesses on a global scale, it’s important to identify what are the current barriers to entry for anyone to start using the marketplace. After that, it’s crucial to identify what can be done about it and then act on it.</p><p>By definition, a barrier to entry is an obstacle or hindrance that makes it hard to adopt a new product. This obstacle can be a technological challenge, difficult government regulations, a steep financial cost, a lack of education about a topic, and etc. In the Open Marketplace’s case, the barriers to entry are mostly <strong>technological</strong>, <strong>financial</strong>, and<strong> educational</strong>.</p><p>That much is made quite obvious when you start to go over the list of the most reported issues, comments, and feedback regarding the user experience of the marketplace since it’s been released on mainnet. When all summarized, most of it can be boiled down to a few main barriers to entry that makes it a bit challenging for buyers and sellers to adopt the platform. Some of the most reported user experience issues include:</p><ul><li>The setup process of the marketplace (it has to be manually enabled) could be improved <strong>(technological barrier)</strong></li><li>Listing fees being too high for large-scale sellers <strong>(financial barrier)</strong></li><li>The double deposit MAD escrow requires a security deposit from both sides <strong>(financial barrier)</strong></li><li>There is no branding or identification option for vendors <strong>(technological barrier)</strong></li><li>The marketplace currently only accepts the PART coin and not Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, or more traditional means of payment <strong>(technological barrier)</strong></li><li>The entire blockchain and SMSG network needs to be synced, which takes a few minutes to do<strong> (technological barrier)</strong></li><li>What needs to be done to complete a certain action isn’t always perfectly clear <strong>(educational barrier)</strong></li><li>How funds move throughout a full transaction process <strong>(educational barrier)</strong></li></ul><p>These barriers to entry are the main obstacles that make it harder for Particl to be adopted to a wider level. As such, solutions to these issues will be prioritized moving forward, and each item contained within the Open Marketplace development roadmap for the next few months is designed to increase the adoption of the Open Marketplace by improving the user experience.</p><h2 id=\"make-particl-as-accessible-as-any-other-marketplace\">Make Particl as Accessible as Any Other Marketplace</h2><p>To eliminate the barriers that make the Open Marketplace hard to adopt for most people, the Particl team has planned and started working on several improvements and features. Each of them is designed to feed off each other and directly contribute to improving Particl’s user experience for both buyers and sellers.</p><p>What follows is an estimated release timeline of the next few features that are going to make their way onto Particl’s Open Marketplace. There’s currently no date or time estimate associated with any of these features, but they’re what’s being worked on at this moment and what is planned to be released in the short to mid-term.</p><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>This development timeline is only an estimation of the order at which features will be released live on mainnet.

In their most common sense, they are storefronts on which a seller can “set up a shop” in such a way that only him (or the people he gives administrator rights to) can publish listings. Anyone with access to a storefront can only buy (or flag) the listings put on there by the owner of the storefront. Storefronts can also be used by communities looking for higher standards in quality on which only vetted sellers could publish listings.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> By default, Particl Desktop has no way to automatically find Market IDs on the network. These keys need to be distributed manually by whoever wants people to interact with a certain market or storefront…unless these markets/storefronts get promoted.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-xEOnXDjpfjoRMz-Gyasahg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Promote a Market or Storefront (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>While Particl Desktop cannot automatically scan and detect community markets, it is still possible to <strong>promote your market</strong> to the network, for a fee. When “promoting” your market (or storefront), your Particl Desktop client broadcasts the Market ID of your market to the network using SMSG. It is then picked up by the other clients connected to the Particl network, and is added to a “market browser”. At this point, a market will act just like a listing. It will show up on the market browser for the amount of time it’s been promoted. Once the promotion period ends, the market disappears from the market browser.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Once a market or storefront disappears from the market browser, it is still accessible to anyone with its Market ID. The only difference is that it won’t be publicly accessible from the market browser itself.</blockquote><p>Anyone with the proper Market IDs of a market or storefront can promote it. All the fees paid to bump/promote community markets are, just like the listing fees, redistributed to stakers.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-5utZ5LvZNv-3EOxW_ueeow.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Create a New Storefront With Logo (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>Storefronts are ideal for sellers with an already established reputation. It allows them to guarantee to their customer base that a given market, thus all products published inside of it, belongs to him. This can easily be done by, for example, displaying the Market ID of the storefront on the seller’s official website.</p><p>Additionally, storefronts allow for a minimal amount of customization/branding (logo, store description, store title) and aggregate all the listings of a vendor to a single point of access This makes it easier and quicker for customers to find what they’re looking for, when they need it.</p><h3 id=\"adjustable-escrow-ratio\">Adjustable Escrow Ratio</h3><p>As it stands right now, Particl’s double deposit MAD escrow system only works using a 100% ratio, meaning both parties need to deposit a security deposit equal to 100% of the value of the item or service being purchased. There’s nothing wrong with that, of course. After all, a 100% ratio does provide the best game-theory for this type of escrow. There might, however, be some circumstances where such an escrow system wouldn’t be ideal.</p><p>Take the example of a well-known seller that’s already trusted by its customer base and runs a storefront on Particl. This seller might want to move some of its inventory on Particl to save on fees and improve the level of privacy for his business as well as his customers. But since that seller is already well-known and has an established customer base, it might not be ideal for both the seller and its customer to front funds in order to cover a double deposit MAD escrow smart-contract. There is already trust that’s been established between the two parties and, since the seller is running a Particl storefront, he can prove ownership of the products being offered simply by spreading his Market ID on his website or social media pages. In that situation, the required security deposits become an unnecessary obstacle for both the seller and the buyer as they do not necessarily require, or want, escrow protection for transactions.</p><p>What an adjustable escrow would mean is that vendors could set up their own escrow ratio preferences from 0% to 100%. In the above example of a well-known seller running a Particl storefront, he could just reduce his escrow ratio to 0%, meaning no security deposit would be required from neither the buyer or the vendor. This, of course, means that buyers would have no recourse against a dishonest seller, but for those already-established sellers with an existing customer base, having the opportunity to not have to advance coins to fund the escrow system would make adopting Particl’s Open Marketplace much more of a no-brainer.</p><h3 id=\"inventory-and-quantity-management-tool\">Inventory and Quantity Management Tool</h3><p>This feature is self-explanatory. There is no way, currently, to manage a wide inventory and add quantities to your listing. Fortunately, the marketplace back-end currently allows for most of it, but it hasn’t been integrated into the Open Marketplace just yet. Note that a relatively fair amount of development is still needed around this feature and it is likely to be released after the Market Management tool.</p><p>This tool, like its name implies, allows vendors to easily manage inventory quantities, manage multiple listings, and etc. Just like the Product Import tool, Inventory Management is going to make it way easier for sellers with large inventories to take the leap and get started selling on Particl without it being a big hassle.</p><hr><h2 id=\"then-what\"><strong>Then What?</strong></h2><p>All of the above-mentioned items are placed into a short to mid-term roadmap, meaning they are likely to be released within the next few weeks and months, depending on the feature. But wait, there’s more to it!</p><p>The Particl team is thinking ahead and has already planned and started doing research on the features that are going to be worked on once the above marketplace development roadmap is completed.</p><h3 id=\"alternative-payment-options-bitcoin-payments\">Alternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments</h3><p>One of the barriers to entry for Particl’s Open Marketplace currently is that it only works with PART, Particl’s native privacy coin. This, of course, is due to the nature of the technology and how the marketplace has to use <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>PART for its privacy and smart-contract capabilities</strong></a>. If it were using Bitcoin, not only would transactions take a considerably longer time due to longer confirmations, but the marketplace wouldn’t be able to offer a private-by-default experience to its users. And if it were using Monero, it would be okay on the privacy side of things, but then the coin couldn’t be used within smart-contracts. The <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>PART coin is a next-generation privacy coin that has both a solid privacy scheme and a flexible codebase</strong></a> which allows it to be used within smart-contracts. As far as privacy coins come, it’s pretty much getting your cake and eating it too! The good stuff…without the limitations.</p><p>But in the end, people want an easy-to-use marketplace with good user experience, and only accepting PART severely limits the number of new users that can be onboarded (that’s because everybody uses Bitcoin, mostly). To address this issue, the Particl team is going to be working on integrating alternative methods of payments, like paying with Bitcoin, for example.</p><p>There are a couple of ways this can be done, either through an atomic swap widget or by integrating a third-party partner. And while the Particl team would like to use an atomic swap solution (research and development on the matter is ongoing at this very moment), a third-party integration might have to be coded in until an atomic swap application is fully ready (and thoroughly tested) to go. There are currently investigations going into this question specifically, and so more details will be able to be communicated in the future.</p><p>It’s important to note though that, regardless of the method chosen to accept different payment methods, the PART coin will always be the coin that settles the transaction in the end. That’s because even though Particl’s Open Marketplace would be accepting Bitcoin, the marketplace Dapp still needs PART to operate as it is the coin that gives it its privacy and smart-contract capabilities. This means any non-PART payments will be automatically converted into a PART transaction, in the background, on behalf of the user. The end result is that the buyer pays with Bitcoin, and the Open Marketplace does all the rest, transferring the Bitcoin into Particl to fuel the escrow contract.</p><h3 id=\"mobile-application\">Mobile Application</h3><p>Another very important upcoming feature is a Particl Open Marketplace mobile application. Indeed, most people now shop on their cellphones, which means downloading a software that requires you to sync two networks (blockchain + SMSG) is definitely a downgrade in terms of user experience. Sure, it provides way better privacy and decentralization, but for most people, this is too weak of an argument against a lazy and fast user-experience.</p><p>And so, to address this issue, the Particl team has scheduled the development of a mobile application. Research is already being put into this item at this very moment, although it is not a top priority for the team right now. That’s because there are still some core features missing to the marketplace (the items in the above roadmap) that need to be added before the team can think of wrapping everything within a mobile application. Once the above roadmap is complete or near-complete, that’s when the Open Marketplace’s mobile application is going to become more of a focus.</p><p>This mobile application will make Particl as accessible as it will have ever been. In fact, most of the world uses cellphones and more and more people now spend more time on their phone than on their computer. To make sure the application has good performance and setup speed, it is more than likely to be a “light wallet”, meaning it won’t require you to download the entire blockchain and SMSG network to function. In other words, this application is intended to be as easy to use as any traditional marketplace mobile application (i.e. Amazon’s application).</p><h3 id=\"developer-sdk-tools\">Developer SDK Tools</h3><p>With bringing more people within the Particl ecosystem in mind, the team has planned for the release of an SDK tool. This tool will be accompanied by various technical documentation that is now currently missing. This will allow outside developers and teams to easily start contributing to the Particl network by developing services, decentralized applications, marketplace features, and etc.</p><p>Because the Open Marketplace is still very much into a heavy development phase, this SDK tool is likely to be one of the last items of this article to see the day. With this in mind, the SDK tool will be going live once the Particl code gets “stable enough” so that it makes sense to commit to a version and write documentation on it.</p><hr><h2 id=\"let-s-wrap-it-up\">Let’s Wrap it Up</h2><p>All of the above-mentioned features that are going to be added to Particl have one thing in common — they are part of a bigger puzzle that’s gonna make the Open Marketplace much more accessible and easy to use for everyone. They all contribute to eliminate the current barriers to entry that makes adopting Particl more complicated for most people.</p><p>Once in place, these should take Particl to the next level, making it a much more credible contender for mainstream adoption. In the meantime, Particl pioneers such as you can still buy and sell anything for crypto, without leaving a trace, using the current version of the Open Marketplace. And since the marketplace is now live on mainnet, new features and improvements can be expected to come out at an accelerated pace!</p><p>Particl is now well on its way on the path towards mainstream adoption. The development team is now a well-oiled machine and is excited to enter this new phase for the Particl project. The base layer is there, now it’s all about putting the last pieces to the puzzle together. This is where it gets exciting and when it starts moving faster!</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-uAgpsfe9xDDVHe1pF6zJdg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure>","url":"http://localhost:2368/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"994d687a-0700-42af-9230-d514c67d48e9","codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5f7e4ca61a93b603e3f767b2","reading_time":16,"send_email_when_published":false,"email_subject":null,"childHtmlRehype":{"html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-r41YvsRXOJyeVDkN_GcTqg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><h3 id=\"new-marketplace-development-update-roadmap\">New Marketplace Development Update &#x26; Roadmap</h3><p>It has now been more than 2 weeks since the Particl Open Marketplace has launched on mainnet. This release has been a historic moment for the project and a huge stepping stone for the upcoming eCommerce revolution that Particl is brewing up.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-QjorfnMkAgAxEXVbGdPndw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl’s Open Marketplace Live on Mainnet ?</figcaption></figure><p>Since that time, the team has certainly not been taking it slow. No, it’s instead been carefully monitoring the community for feedback and comments regarding the overall user experience of this first live version of the marketplace and has started working on several features that are soon going to make their way onto the marketplace. It’s important to remind ourselves that this version of the Open Marketplace is an early Beta version and is in no way the “end” of anything for Particl. Quite to the contrary, it is the beginning of a great journey in disrupting one of the biggest economic sector of the world— the eCommerce sector.</p><p>It’s been mentioned in the past that, as the Open Marketplace goes live on mainnet, it would signify a gradual change of phase for the project. Whereas Particl used to be almost exclusively focused on development, getting a live product means user adoption will now play a more important role. After all, this project has always been about building a product that people could use to address <strong>real-world issues. </strong>It has always been about creating a solution that empowers individuals and enables businesses to reach their full potential. And now that the solution is here, it’s time to get people to use it and benefit from its groundbreaking technology.</p><h2 id=\"now-it-s-adoption-time-\">Now it’s Adoption Time!</h2><p>Ever since the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace, the Particl team has received a huge amount of feedback and comments about the overall user experience. And it is this user experience, the feeling you get when using the marketplace, that is critical in getting new people and businesses to use Particl. It is one of the key factors in determining the “user conversion rate”, or the number of people that become recurring users after trying out the marketplace for the first time.</p><p>Indeed, getting new people to try out the marketplace is one thing, but retaining them as users is a whole other story. Most of the time, people are more than willing to sacrifice their data and even pay higher prices if the user experience is better elsewhere. And besides, you also get one chance at first impressions.</p><p>For this reason, <strong>the new Open Marketplace development roadmap will now be heavily focused on building what needs to be done to make the user experience as good and as accessible as possible. </strong>In other words, each new marketplace feature released within the next few weeks and months will directly contribute in making the user experience better, thus increasing the user conversion rate and allowing more sellers and buyers to be onboarded.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-current-barriers-to-entry\">What are the Current Barriers to Entry</h2><p>Since the ultimate goal of the Open Marketplace is to empower individuals and businesses on a global scale, it’s important to identify what are the current barriers to entry for anyone to start using the marketplace. After that, it’s crucial to identify what can be done about it and then act on it.</p><p>By definition, a barrier to entry is an obstacle or hindrance that makes it hard to adopt a new product. This obstacle can be a technological challenge, difficult government regulations, a steep financial cost, a lack of education about a topic, and etc. In the Open Marketplace’s case, the barriers to entry are mostly <strong>technological</strong>, <strong>financial</strong>, and<strong> educational</strong>.</p><p>That much is made quite obvious when you start to go over the list of the most reported issues, comments, and feedback regarding the user experience of the marketplace since it’s been released on mainnet. When all summarized, most of it can be boiled down to a few main barriers to entry that makes it a bit challenging for buyers and sellers to adopt the platform. Some of the most reported user experience issues include:</p><ul><li>The setup process of the marketplace (it has to be manually enabled) could be improved <strong>(technological barrier)</strong></li><li>Listing fees being too high for large-scale sellers <strong>(financial barrier)</strong></li><li>The double deposit MAD escrow requires a security deposit from both sides <strong>(financial barrier)</strong></li><li>There is no branding or identification option for vendors <strong>(technological barrier)</strong></li><li>The marketplace currently only accepts the PART coin and not Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, or more traditional means of payment <strong>(technological barrier)</strong></li><li>The entire blockchain and SMSG network needs to be synced, which takes a few minutes to do<strong> (technological barrier)</strong></li><li>What needs to be done to complete a certain action isn’t always perfectly clear <strong>(educational barrier)</strong></li><li>How funds move throughout a full transaction process <strong>(educational barrier)</strong></li></ul><p>These barriers to entry are the main obstacles that make it harder for Particl to be adopted to a wider level. As such, solutions to these issues will be prioritized moving forward, and each item contained within the Open Marketplace development roadmap for the next few months is designed to increase the adoption of the Open Marketplace by improving the user experience.</p><h2 id=\"make-particl-as-accessible-as-any-other-marketplace\">Make Particl as Accessible as Any Other Marketplace</h2><p>To eliminate the barriers that make the Open Marketplace hard to adopt for most people, the Particl team has planned and started working on several improvements and features. Each of them is designed to feed off each other and directly contribute to improving Particl’s user experience for both buyers and sellers.</p><p>What follows is an estimated release timeline of the next few features that are going to make their way onto Particl’s Open Marketplace. There’s currently no date or time estimate associated with any of these features, but they’re what’s being worked on at this moment and what is planned to be released in the short to mid-term.</p><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>This development timeline is only an estimation of the order at which features will be released live on mainnet. All listed items are subject to change.</blockquote><hr><h3 id=\"what-s-coming-up-for-particl\">What’s Coming Up for Particl?</h3><ul><li><a href=\"#8c5a\"><strong>User Interface Tweaks</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"#5f27\"><strong>Lowering Marketplace Fees</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"#909d\"><strong>Product Import Tool</strong></a><strong> (1)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#3d73\"><strong>Q&#x26;A Section — Ask a Question to a Seller</strong></a><strong> (2)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#c8cb\"><strong>Particl Desktop Settings Page</strong></a><strong> (3)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#7168\"><strong>Market Management Tool</strong></a><strong> (4)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#e90f\"><strong>Adjustable Escrow Ratio</strong></a><strong> (5)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#3d2b\"><strong>Inventory and Quantity Management Tool</strong></a><strong> (6)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#5a71\"><strong>Then What?</strong></a><br><a href=\"#a7e1\">Alternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments</a><br><a href=\"#c75e\">Mobile Application</a><br><a href=\"#9733\">Developer SDK Tools</a></li></ul><hr><h3 id=\"user-interface-tweaks\">User Interface Tweaks</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-ZdZYzwxy3xJGIyMnGSbIwQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Improved Sell Orders Page (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>The lowest hanging fruit for impoving Particl’s user experience is by making several tweaks to the user interface of Particl Desktop, the client on which the Open Marketplace is hosted. These tweaks are currently being worked on based on user feedback and will make using Particl much easier, especially for those who haven’t used it in the past. These improvements and additions will also display more information to buyers and sellers, making it easier to track what’s happening within the client (i.e. why funds are moving around, or at what time has a certain transaction been locked into escrow, and etc).</p><h3 id=\"lowering-marketplace-fees\">Lowering Marketplace Fees</h3><p>One of the most reported issue with the Open Marketplace is the cost of listing an item. As the marketplace is fully autonomous and isn’t being operated by any third-party, it charges no commission, subscription, payment processing, or escrow fee at all. It does, however, charge a small listing fee to fight off spam on the network.</p><p>In fact, when listing an item, the network usually charges sellers with a few cents worth of PART every day. And while it isn’t that big of a deal for any seller making a few sales here and there on their listings, especially given the fact that no commission is being charged on top of sales, it can quickly add up for some of the smaller scale vendors who struggle to make sales and sellers with huge inventories (hundreds/thousands of listings).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-OLpQIvxuczEzoa_flsWpfw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Adjusting Marketplace Listing Fees on the Partyman App</figcaption></figure><p>Fortunately, you can actually contribute to making this listing fee smaller. <a href=\"https://particl.news/adjusting-listing-fees-4b676e230601\"><strong>The Particl team has published on their blog a full tutorial</strong></a> on how to instruct your staking node to broadcast a request for lower fees to the SMSG network. SMSG is the network on which marketplace-related content is published and hosted.</p><p>Additionally, the Particl team is in the process of improving and optimizing the SMSG network. It is estimated that the marketplace fees (i.e. listing fees) will significantly be lowered due to the more effective SMSG codebase.</p><p>These changes will come gradually within the Beta phase of development of the marketplace as updates get pushed.</p><h3 id=\"product-import-tool\">Product Import Tool</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-nV8MXWfbGAStemdjRDT_EQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Product Import Tool (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>One of the key components of a two-sided marketplace is getting a good amount of sellers and listed products. This is why the new Particl Open Marketplace roadmap for the next few months includes a lot of tools that will make it easier for sellers to adopt the platform.</p><p>One such tool is the Product Import tool. This tool allows vendors to quickly import large inventories from other sources, considerably reducing the time it takes to populate the marketplace when holding custody of large inventories. Without this feature, sellers need to manually add listings one by one, which is a very time-consuming process.</p><p>With this feature in place, sellers are going to be able to import and list large inventories with only a few clicks. Outside sources for inventory importation will include WooCommerce stores and CSV files (spreadsheets). More options are very likely to be added in the future.</p><h3 id=\"qa-section-ask-a-question-to-a-seller\">Q&#x26;A Section — Ask a Question to a Seller</h3><p>But a two-sided marketplace being a two-sided marketplace, it also needs a good amount of buyers so that it can reach its full potential. This is where the upcoming Q&#x26;A section comes into play.</p><p>This “comment section” will allow anyone to ask questions to vendors before purchasing (or flagging) a product. This isn’t unlike the very popular Q&#x26;A section that Amazon has had for some time now, and it goes a great way into giving you information that might be missing from the item’s description.</p><p>This feature, while not a direct line of contact with the seller, will help buyers make more informed purchasing decisions and give a little bit more confidence when buying an item from a complete stranger. The more you know, the better decisions one can make.</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-settings-page\">Particl Desktop Settings Page</h3><p>The Particl Desktop Settings page is a no-brainer. Currently, if you want to change a configuration on your Particl Desktop client, you either have to modify some config file or enter some command inside the console. This works, but since the goal is to make Particl’s user experience as good as possible, it’s definitely not as user-friendly as it should be.</p><p>The Settings page is pretty much what you would expect from a…settings page. It allows you to change various preferences without having to go through the hassle of finding a tutorial on how to find and modify a config file, or find a list of commands to enter in the console.</p><h3 id=\"market-management-tool\">Market Management Tool</h3><p>The Market Management tool is one of the most awaited features of the Open Marketplace, and rightly so. It is what’s going to make all the individual pieces of the marketplace click together and form into a giant distributed network of markets.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-sQWfEk-U6lWzv8ijSfJBng.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Select What Market (or Storefront) to Browse (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>Market Management will allow you to either create a market of your own or connect your client to a pre-existing one. These community markets can be created by anyone and are completely independent of the main interface of the Open Marketplace. In fact, they are powered by completely different sets of market keys, meaning no data can be shared between the different markets. It’s like multi-wallets, but more advanced and for markets.</p><p>On Particl, there are two types of markets: community markets, and storefronts.</p><p><strong>Community Markets:</strong> They are markets on which anyone that has access to it can buy or sell goods and services. They function exactly the same as the main interface of the Open Marketplace, and nobody has any special permission over other users. Not even the market creator. These markets, however, are not enabled nor visible by default. To access these markets, you need to connect your Particl Desktop client to its Market ID.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> The main interface of the Open Marketplace is a community market that’s enabled and displayed by default by the Particl Desktop client.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-Gh6FqychOcQ2f49d-D_laA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Joined Markets (and Storefronts) Page (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Storefronts: </strong>They are customizable community markets on which special permissions can be attributed to various users.

There’s nothing wrong with that, of course. After all, a 100% ratio does provide the best game-theory for this type of escrow. There might, however, be some circumstances where such an escrow system wouldn’t be ideal.</p><p>Take the example of a well-known seller that’s already trusted by its customer base and runs a storefront on Particl. This seller might want to move some of its inventory on Particl to save on fees and improve the level of privacy for his business as well as his customers. But since that seller is already well-known and has an established customer base, it might not be ideal for both the seller and its customer to front funds in order to cover a double deposit MAD escrow smart-contract. There is already trust that’s been established between the two parties and, since the seller is running a Particl storefront, he can prove ownership of the products being offered simply by spreading his Market ID on his website or social media pages. In that situation, the required security deposits become an unnecessary obstacle for both the seller and the buyer as they do not necessarily require, or want, escrow protection for transactions.</p><p>What an adjustable escrow would mean is that vendors could set up their own escrow ratio preferences from 0% to 100%. In the above example of a well-known seller running a Particl storefront, he could just reduce his escrow ratio to 0%, meaning no security deposit would be required from neither the buyer or the vendor. This, of course, means that buyers would have no recourse against a dishonest seller, but for those already-established sellers with an existing customer base, having the opportunity to not have to advance coins to fund the escrow system would make adopting Particl’s Open Marketplace much more of a no-brainer.</p><h3 id=\"inventory-and-quantity-management-tool\">Inventory and Quantity Management Tool</h3><p>This feature is self-explanatory. There is no way, currently, to manage a wide inventory and add quantities to your listing. Fortunately, the marketplace back-end currently allows for most of it, but it hasn’t been integrated into the Open Marketplace just yet. Note that a relatively fair amount of development is still needed around this feature and it is likely to be released after the Market Management tool.</p><p>This tool, like its name implies, allows vendors to easily manage inventory quantities, manage multiple listings, and etc. Just like the Product Import tool, Inventory Management is going to make it way easier for sellers with large inventories to take the leap and get started selling on Particl without it being a big hassle.</p><hr><h2 id=\"then-what\"><strong>Then What?</strong></h2><p>All of the above-mentioned items are placed into a short to mid-term roadmap, meaning they are likely to be released within the next few weeks and months, depending on the feature. But wait, there’s more to it!</p><p>The Particl team is thinking ahead and has already planned and started doing research on the features that are going to be worked on once the above marketplace development roadmap is completed.</p><h3 id=\"alternative-payment-options-bitcoin-payments\">Alternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments</h3><p>One of the barriers to entry for Particl’s Open Marketplace currently is that it only works with PART, Particl’s native privacy coin. This, of course, is due to the nature of the technology and how the marketplace has to use <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>PART for its privacy and smart-contract capabilities</strong></a>. If it were using Bitcoin, not only would transactions take a considerably longer time due to longer confirmations, but the marketplace wouldn’t be able to offer a private-by-default experience to its users. And if it were using Monero, it would be okay on the privacy side of things, but then the coin couldn’t be used within smart-contracts. The <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>PART coin is a next-generation privacy coin that has both a solid privacy scheme and a flexible codebase</strong></a> which allows it to be used within smart-contracts. As far as privacy coins come, it’s pretty much getting your cake and eating it too! The good stuff…without the limitations.</p><p>But in the end, people want an easy-to-use marketplace with good user experience, and only accepting PART severely limits the number of new users that can be onboarded (that’s because everybody uses Bitcoin, mostly). To address this issue, the Particl team is going to be working on integrating alternative methods of payments, like paying with Bitcoin, for example.</p><p>There are a couple of ways this can be done, either through an atomic swap widget or by integrating a third-party partner. And while the Particl team would like to use an atomic swap solution (research and development on the matter is ongoing at this very moment), a third-party integration might have to be coded in until an atomic swap application is fully ready (and thoroughly tested) to go. There are currently investigations going into this question specifically, and so more details will be able to be communicated in the future.</p><p>It’s important to note though that, regardless of the method chosen to accept different payment methods, the PART coin will always be the coin that settles the transaction in the end. That’s because even though Particl’s Open Marketplace would be accepting Bitcoin, the marketplace Dapp still needs PART to operate as it is the coin that gives it its privacy and smart-contract capabilities. This means any non-PART payments will be automatically converted into a PART transaction, in the background, on behalf of the user. The end result is that the buyer pays with Bitcoin, and the Open Marketplace does all the rest, transferring the Bitcoin into Particl to fuel the escrow contract.</p><h3 id=\"mobile-application\">Mobile Application</h3><p>Another very important upcoming feature is a Particl Open Marketplace mobile application. Indeed, most people now shop on their cellphones, which means downloading a software that requires you to sync two networks (blockchain + SMSG) is definitely a downgrade in terms of user experience. Sure, it provides way better privacy and decentralization, but for most people, this is too weak of an argument against a lazy and fast user-experience.</p><p>And so, to address this issue, the Particl team has scheduled the development of a mobile application. Research is already being put into this item at this very moment, although it is not a top priority for the team right now. That’s because there are still some core features missing to the marketplace (the items in the above roadmap) that need to be added before the team can think of wrapping everything within a mobile application. Once the above roadmap is complete or near-complete, that’s when the Open Marketplace’s mobile application is going to become more of a focus.</p><p>This mobile application will make Particl as accessible as it will have ever been. In fact, most of the world uses cellphones and more and more people now spend more time on their phone than on their computer. To make sure the application has good performance and setup speed, it is more than likely to be a “light wallet”, meaning it won’t require you to download the entire blockchain and SMSG network to function. In other words, this application is intended to be as easy to use as any traditional marketplace mobile application (i.e. Amazon’s application).</p><h3 id=\"developer-sdk-tools\">Developer SDK Tools</h3><p>With bringing more people within the Particl ecosystem in mind, the team has planned for the release of an SDK tool. This tool will be accompanied by various technical documentation that is now currently missing. This will allow outside developers and teams to easily start contributing to the Particl network by developing services, decentralized applications, marketplace features, and etc.</p><p>Because the Open Marketplace is still very much into a heavy development phase, this SDK tool is likely to be one of the last items of this article to see the day. With this in mind, the SDK tool will be going live once the Particl code gets “stable enough” so that it makes sense to commit to a version and write documentation on it.</p><hr><h2 id=\"let-s-wrap-it-up\">Let’s Wrap it Up</h2><p>All of the above-mentioned features that are going to be added to Particl have one thing in common — they are part of a bigger puzzle that’s gonna make the Open Marketplace much more accessible and easy to use for everyone. They all contribute to eliminate the current barriers to entry that makes adopting Particl more complicated for most people.</p><p>Once in place, these should take Particl to the next level, making it a much more credible contender for mainstream adoption. In the meantime, Particl pioneers such as you can still buy and sell anything for crypto, without leaving a trace, using the current version of the Open Marketplace. And since the marketplace is now live on mainnet, new features and improvements can be expected to come out at an accelerated pace!</p><p>Particl is now well on its way on the path towards mainstream adoption. The development team is now a well-oiled machine and is excited to enter this new phase for the Particl project. The base layer is there, now it’s all about putting the last pieces to the puzzle together. This is where it gets exciting and when it starts moving faster!</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-uAgpsfe9xDDVHe1pF6zJdg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":["kg-card","kg-image-card"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-r41YvsRXOJyeVDkN_GcTqg.jpeg","className":["kg-image"],"alt":""},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"new-marketplace-development-update-roadmap"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"New Marketplace Development Update & Roadmap"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"It has now been more than 2 weeks since the Particl Open Marketplace has launched on mainnet.

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est. July, 2025\n * Implementation: Upon successful vote (75% approval rate with minimum quorum\n   of 20% of the total supply over 10,080 blocks) and subsequent hard fork.\n\nImpact\nIf approved, this change will:\n\n * Significantly reduce PART's inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%;\n * Reduce PART’s inflation rate by 0.5% every year until it reaches 1.0%;\n * Remove the network treasury;\n * Initiate a hard fork of the Particl blockchain.\n\nWe believe this proposal represents a positive step toward optimizing the\nParticl network's economic model while ensuring sustainable project development\nand incentivising our community to actively promote and grow the\nnetwork.Important: For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are\nrunning its latest version.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come.
