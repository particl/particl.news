So, without further ado, the time for the weekly\nstatus report has come. This week has been a continuation of the work reported\nin the past few progress reports. \n\nOn the side of Particl Desktop, there's not much new stuff that stands out other\nthan the previously mentioned items seeing some progress. As usual, a few minor\nbugs and improvements, as reported by community members, have been fixed and\nwill be included in the next version of Particl Desktop (3.1). Thanks to all of\nour dedicated community members that are still reporting issues and making\nsuggestions to this day; it's incredibly useful and has a big impact on the\nquality of the product!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Development Progress\nHere's a short list of the current items being worked on or planned on being\nworked on in the short term. \n\nPlease note that these items are part of the immediate priority the team has set\nup following the release of Particl V3 on mainnet. They are meant to support the\nmainnet release by making its foundation better. While they may appear minor,\nthey are vital to different types of users and will go a long way in making\nParticl Marketplace more usable in the immediate.\n\nAny new major feature or function is planned for Particl Desktop 3.2 and\nsubsequent versions.\n\n * Several features related to better vendor inventory import/update. We can\n   report that the ability to batch update prices to multiple listings at once\n   is mostly completed, with only UI tweaks and additional testing being\n   required. The addition of a product code and the ability to import images\n   directly through the CSV file directly is still in progress and is expected\n   to be wrapped up next week, if all goes well. \n * The usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace for better,\n   more customizable formatting. This task has already been started but has been\n   put on pause until the above items are completed. It is estimated that this\n   item will be completed very quickly once its development resumes.\n * Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address\n   requirement (i.e., download links, NFTs, user codes, etc.). This task has not\n   been started yet.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Core Development Progress\nParticl's core developer, Tecnovert, has spent the vast majority of the week\ntesting the upcoming BasicSwap DEX and fixing various small issues. We are happy\nto report that the protocol is now pretty stable but still requires testing as\nthe upcoming open beta will be over mainnet (meaning you'll be able to swap\n\"real coins\"). That's why it needs to be as secure as possible and cater to any\npotential weird case.\n\nOn that note, the GUI for the open beta is currently under work and will be\nmoved as a top priority starting on Monday next week. Please keep in mind that\nthe GUI for the open beta is not at all how we intend it to be on the date of\nthe official release; it's merely so that you can test the bare protocol is a\nmore user-friendly way.\n\nWe've mentioned it in the past, but it's worth repeating; we've got many\nsurprises planned for BasicSwap and have a big strategic vision for it. While we\nhaven't released too much information about it, or on how we plan on leveraging\nit to make Particl go viral, but we do not want to play our cards too early for\nmany reasons.\n\nAs we make solid progress on the upcoming DEX every week and check more and more\nitems off of its to-do list, we near its official announcement and the reveal of\nmuch key information regarding it. We can't wait to share those with you and\nwe're absolutely thrilled with the direction it's taking. Stay tuned for more\ninformation, it's coming shortly!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks everybody for your support and passion. Particl is a long-term project\nwith a bold but very precise vision. We're absolutely blessed to have such a\ndedicated community tagging along for the ride and that understands what this\nproject is working to achieve.\n\nWe wish you all a great weekend, we'll see you on Monday!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

We've\nopted to create a specific section for it named \"Progress\" and available on the\nnavigation bar at the top of this page. This reduces the bloat on the start page\nand makes it easier to follow the course of events that surround Particl. Follow\nthe link here [https://particl.news/tag/progress/] to get all the progress\nreports. \n\nNow let's get to the interesting part!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Development Progress\nA good portion of the week has been spent on improving SMSG messages propagation\nand handling from Particl Desktop to fix an outstanding issue that caused\nproblems for some users. A change was made to the marketplace handling of the\nresponse from core regarding sent messages; instead of failing only when a\nspecific failure case is met, it should now fail for everything unless it meets\nspecific success criteria. Although the fix still requires more testing, it's\nlikely that the issue is fixed by now. A few other reported issues are being\nlooked into, as is usual.\n\nAside from that, progress has continued over the previously-stated items,\ngradually leading up to the Particl Desktop 3.1 version.\n\n * Several features related to better vendor inventory import/update. This\n   includes the provision of a product code (allowing for updates to items via\n   CSV amongst other things), the ability to update pricing via the batch\n   publish window, and the ability to import images through the CSV file\n   directly (with the possibility to specify the category and target market\n   directly from the CSV coming soon as well). This task has been marked with\n   notable progress this week.\n * The usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace for better,\n   more customizable formatting. This task has already been started but has been\n   put on pause until the above items are completed. It is estimated that this\n   item will be completed very quickly once its development resumes.\n * Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address\n   requirement (i.e., download links, NFTs, user codes, etc.). This task has not\n   been started yet.\n\nParticl Core and Other Development Progress\nThis week on the Core side of things, a lot of merges and updates have gone into\nParticl Core and the SMSG network. Notably, some investigation and work have\ngone towards looking into reducing marketplace listing fees, which should go\ninto effect in a future hardfork. As always, you can track Particl Core\ndevelopments by checking out the Github repository here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core].\n\nAdditionally, BasicSwap has received a lot of focus this week with breakthrough\nachievements being reached. Stay tuned for more details soon!\n\nMarketplace Listing Seeding Proposal\nFinally, there have been a few questions regarding the fully-funded Listing\nSeeding Proposal and its development status. We can confirm that the proposal is\nindeed under development at this present time, but as mentioned in the proposal,\nit is being done mostly outside of Particl's regular work scope. It's also being\ndeveloped in a private capacity.\n\nSince publishing the proposal, several iterations have been explored and the\nproject has evolved into a more important undertaking. While we do not want to\nconfirm any final structure at this moment, we are working towards making the\nsystem more open ended-instead of limited to the members who initially published\nthe proposal.\n\nIndeed, we are heavily considering making the \"listing seeding system\" usable by\nany community member looking to populate the marketplace with listings and\nmanage them from a web interface.\n\nAs a final note on this subject, it's important to be aware that this proposal\nis now dependent on a few upcoming items, notably the SMSG Controller roadmap\nitem. Additionally, while not a hard requirement, it would highly benefit from\nSMSG 2.0 which, if you remember, is expected to dramatically increase the\nscalability of Particl apps and services.\n\nFrom now on, we will include development updates for this proposal, when there\nis any to mention, in the weekly progress reports such as this one.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe wish you a great weekend and thank you all for your incredible support and\npassion for the project's mission. We often mention it, but it's never enough;\nyou are what makes Particl possible and we are grateful to have such an awesome\ncommunity along for the ride!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This\nweek, we've made important progress and have been improving both Particl Desktop\nand the marketplace with a few bug fixes and tweaks to the code.\n\nNotably, we can report that the migration of Particl Desktop from Particl Core\nversion 0.19x to 0.21 is now complete. Although there has been a fair amount of\ntesting already, the team is looking to test it out more to ensure no issue\narises (as you can remember, Particl Core 0.21 introduced many changes that\ntouch on several aspects of the marketplace) before pushing it live. However, we\ncan confirm that Particl Core 0.21x will be the core version of Particl Desktop\n3.1.\n\nOther than that, a good portion of this week's focus has gone towards fixing a\nfew bugs and implementing improvements to both the desktop client and the\nmarketplace. Among these, we improved on the code that displayed the number of\nPART \"locked\" on Particl Desktop. In some cases, the indicated amount was simply\ninaccurate, leading to some users (in rare cases) seeing more \"locked\" coins\nthan they even owned in the first place. This was merely a display bug and has\nbeen fixed.\n\nFinally, another minor display issue has been improved. When converting funds\nfrom one type to another (i.e., public to anon), the Overview page only\ndisplayed the fee paid for the conversion instead of what amount was converted.\nThis is now fixed and will go live in the next version of Particl Desktop.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Development Progress\nThe list of outstanding tasks remains the same as last week's, with one item now\nbeing complete (migrating to Particl Core 0.21). As mentioned in the\nintroduction of this progress report, a lot of the work has gone towards fixing\nsome bugs and integrating improvements to both Particl Desktop and the\nmarketplace.\n\nAs soon as the OMP Library bug is fixed, development will resume on these items:\n\n * Update Particl Desktop and particl-market (marketplace codebase) to use\n   Particl Core 0.21. This task is now complete. \n * Several features related to better vendor inventory import/update. This\n   includes the provision of a product code (allowing for updates to items via\n   CSV amongst other things), the ability to update pricing via the batch\n   publish window, and the ability to import images through the CSV file\n   directly (with the possibility to specify the category and target market\n   directly from the CSV coming soon as well). This task is currently in\n   progress.\n * The usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace for better,\n   more customizable formatting. This task has already been started but has been\n   put on pause until the above items are completed. It is estimated that this\n   item will be completed very quickly once its development resumes.\n * Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address\n   requirement (i.e., download links, NFTs, user codes, etc.). This task has not\n   been started yet.\n\nToday, we want to provide additional information regarding the \"ability to\nupdate pricing via the batch publish window\".\n\nThis new feature, or rather, an improvement to the batch re-publish feature, is\na way for sellers to quickly batch update their listing prices without having to\nchange them one by one. This is particularly useful for sellers with many\nlistings who want to limit their exposure to PART price volatility.\n\nThis new feature is intended to work as follows, with potential changes being\nmade while it's being coded in (aka, functions not set in stone yet):\n\n * In the batch re-publish window, display the current prices per individual\n   product.\n * Display the \"new\" prices per product that the seller wants to set.\n * Include a global percentage modifier; setting this increments each product's\n   price by the percentage specified by the seller (i.e., putting 20% means all\n   listings have their prices increased by 20%).\n * Include an option per product to specify an exact price change rather than\n   using a global percentage modifier.\n * Include an option to override the global pricing modifier if the seller has\n   one or two items that had a drastic price change outside of the global\n   percentage change. It is also helpful if the seller wants to leave most\n   prices and set a percentage change on a few items only.\n\nAlthough this feature is still a work-in-progress subject to changes, this is\nhow the feature is currently being designed. It will help large sellers\nsignificantly reduce the time required to update their prices and better protect\nthem against PART price volatility. This is a temporary solution until a more\nfleshed-out solution is deployed (stable payments, as mentioned in the most\nrecent roadmap [https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/]).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Core Development Progress\nParticl Core hasn't been much of a focus this week. Instead, Particl's core\ndeveloper, Tecnovert, has focused on developing a new surprise feature for\nBasicSwap; Particl's upcoming cross-chain and private decentralized exchange\n(DEX).\n\nThis feature hasn't yet been announced, whether publicly or even within the\nclosed beta group, and we're reserving its announcement for when we publish the\nofficial BasicSwap introductory blog post.\n\nSpeaking of which, this introductory blog post is the next major announcement\nscheduled for Particl. Keep an eye out on Particl News for this significant\nannouncement; we'll reveal all the details related to BasicSwap and how we\nintend on making it a crucial aspect of the entire Particl ecosystem.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith the recent milestones we've reached together, namely the release of Particl\nV3 on mainnet, the new roadmap, and the website, and also with the upcoming\nmajor release of the BasicSwap open beta, the project is setting a rock-solid\nfoundation for the future of the internet. And even though, at times, the\njourney Particl has chosen to take may seem arduous and challenging, the rewards\nat the end of it are enormous.\n\nIndeed, far from being a \"for the money\" project, Particl is building the future\nof the digital world and strives to create a safe environment without middlemen;\na world that is all about individual freedoms and putting a stop to the reckless\nmining and abuse of your data. With everything it's doing, Particl is in the\nprocess of restoring the balance of power back to the people and away from\ngreedy corporations and agenda-driven organizations.\n\nThank you all for being a part of this important journey and believing firmly in\nthe project's mission. You are today's pioneers for a better tomorrow!\n\nWe wish you all a wonderful weekend, and we'll see you on Monday!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This\nweek, work has continued on the previously identified items. Additionally,\nfollowing feedback from some of the vendors on the marketplace, there's been a\nfair bit of investigation on listing fees and to determine how they could be\nlowered.\n\nFurthermore, a new update to BasicSwap has been pushed, bringing it closer than\never to its open beta phase (more details on that further down below).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Development Progress\nThis week has been a continuation of last week's list of items. \n\nTo provide a bit of clarity, the team is currently working on the Particl\nDesktop 3.1 (or V3.1) release, which focuses on fixing any bug or issue\nidentified since the launch of Particl V3. It also will include a few feature\nimprovements (i.e., the items mentioned in the list below).\n\nParticl Desktop 3.1 is a supporting update for the Particl V3 release and is not\nintended to introduce any new major feature or functionality; that is instead\nplanned for Particl Desktop 3.2 and onward. \n\nHere's the short-term to-do list for Particl Desktop 3.1.\n\n * Update Particl Desktop and particl-market (marketplace codebase) to use\n   Particl Core 0.21. This task is currently in progress and is expected to be\n   completed very shortly.\n * A number of features related to better vendor inventory import/update, which\n   includes the provision of a product code (allowing for updates to items via\n   CSV amongst other things), the ability to update pricing via the batch\n   publish window, and the ability to import images through the CSV file\n   directly (with the possibility to specify the category and target market\n   directly from the CSV coming soon as well). This task is currently in\n   progress.\n * The usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace to allow for\n   better, more customizable formatting. This task has already been started but\n   has been put on pause until the above items are completed. It is estimated\n   that this item will be completed very quickly once its development resumes.\n * Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address\n   requirement (i.e., download links, NFTs, user codes, etc.). This task has not\n   been started yet.\n\nParticl Core Development Progress\nAs we prepare the grounds for the launch of the open beta phase for BasicSwap, a\nnew version for it has been pushed to the closed beta group and requires further\ntesting. This new version introduces a few new features (i.e., private swap\noffers, where users can send private offers that can only be seen by one other\nparticular user) and improves on various functionalities. \n\nAfter the new Particl.io website goes live on Tuesday, you can expect an\nofficial BasicSwap introduction to be the next big piece of communications on\nParticl News. This blog post will explain everything you need to know about\nBasicSwap and officially announce it as the next big item coming up for Particl.\n\nOther than that, an SMSG update has been scheduled for an upcoming Particl\nhardfork. It fixes a case where adjusting markteplace listing fees through \nsmsgfeetarget was ineffective. Investigations on reducing listing fees are\nongoing and additional updates to that effect may be included for the next\nhardfork (no scheduled date at this time, we will inform you when that is the\ncase). \n\nNew Particl Website\nAs mentioned earlier in this update and in yesterday's marketing article, the\nnew Particl.io website is going to go live this coming Tuesday the 26th of\nOctober. Be sure to be around on that day to check it out!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you for your support and passion! You are what makes this project! \n\nBe sure to be around next week for the grand reveal of the new Particl website\nand share it far and wide with people you know will resonate with the project's\nmission.\n\nAnd on that note, we wish you all a great weekend.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

We can report the completion of one of those items; deriving and\nrestoring market-related wallets (identities). \n\nIndeed, in the next update, it'll be possible to restore a market profile\nthrough usual means and then derive all related identities from it to restore\nthe funds they hold. This is an important security addition that makes backing\nand restoring identities a breeze.\n\nOn top of this, a few minor bugs, improvements, and investigations have been\nmade to the desktop client following feedback from the community.\n\nFinally, more progress has been made towards making BasicSwap ready for its Open\nBeta and for Particl Core 0.22 to be mainnet ready (testing is still ongoing).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Development Progress\nAs mentioned in the intro, the short-term development checklist for Particl\nDesktop is similar to last week's, with one item completed since then and more\nprogress made on some of the other ones.\n\n * Allow users to backup and restore marketplace-related wallets. This item\n   turned out to be a bit more complex than initially anticipated, with back-end\n   changes required to the profile and identity system, but it is now complete.\n * Update Particl Desktop and particl-market (marketplace codebase) to use\n   Particl Core 0.21. This recurring task needs to be taken care of for all\n   major releases of Particl Core, but 0.21 introduces some specific changes\n   that require particular attention in relation to the marketplace. This task\n   is currently in progress and is expected to be completed very shortly.\n * A number of features related to better vendor inventory import/update, which\n   includes the provision of a product code (allowing for updates to items via\n   CSV amongst other things), the ability to update pricing via the batch\n   publish window, and the ability to import images through the CSV file\n   directly (with the possibility to specify the category and target market\n   directly from the CSV coming soon as well). This task is currently in\n   progress.\n * The usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace to allow for\n   better, more customizable formatting. This task has already been started but\n   has been put on pause until the above items are completed. It is estimated\n   that this item will be completed very quickly once its development resumes.\n * Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address\n   requirement (i.e., download links, NFTs, user codes, etc.). This task has not\n   been started yet.\n\nOnce the above tasks are completed, we will likely start working on a roadmap\nthat introduces something new rather than exclusively improving the current\nParticl V3's features. We will communicate what this or these new item(s) are\nwhen the time comes.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Core Development Progress\nThis week, Particl's core developer Tecnovert has focused explicitly on two\nspecific items: Particl Core 0.22 and BasicSwap.\n\nParticl Core 0.22\nAs mentioned in last week's development progress report, Particl Core 0.22\nintroduces significant back-end changes must to be adequately tested on all\nplatforms/OSes. Because this is a critical change, we are opting for more\ntesting still at this time. We can report, however, that things are looking good\naside from a few expected quirks here and there that get fixed as we go.\n\nBasicSwap\nThings are getting interesting on this side of things. Tecnovert is finalizing\nthe last few items required for BasicSwap to enter its open beta phase. \n\nNotably, an issue with coin wallets has been resolved, causing significant\nbreaking issues in some cases. The Monero wallet has proven tricky in that case,\nbut a solution has been developed, and the fix is \"complete\". This is not\nintended to be a final solution, as there are cleaner ways to do it, but it is\nstable enough for the open beta.\n\nAnother key missing item for the open beta is the completion of a basic GUI for\nthe DEX. In previous updates, we've shown two previews of BasicSwap GUIs: one\nwas a standalone client and the other an integration into the Particl Desktop\nclient.\n\nFor the open beta, a temporary and more basic GUI will be used. Keep in mind\nthat this phase is still an early one for the DEX and that, even if it works\nfine on mainnet, it will require a few manual steps from the user. In short,\nBasicSwap's open beta won't be a standalone client or a Particl Desktop\nintegration; it will require a few manual (rest assured, nothing too\ncomplicated) steps to build and deploy, which will be clearly explained.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to veer away from these manual steps, but that's expected\nto be the case once the first \"production\" version of BasicSwap is released.\n\nInsight Explorer\nA small fix\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commit/b1baa0314228c3c423a10a30c2690f5a3f10a8a3] \nhas been pushed to the Insight explorer to allow spent indexes to update even if \naddressindex can't.\n\nParticl Website and BasicSwap GUI\nParticl's designer, Gerlof, is putting the final touches on the website and\nfinalizing its testing. It is expected to go live almost any day now. We'd like\nto refer you to last week's report for more information on why its release has\ntaken a few days longer than anticipated. \n\nOnce the website is released, the next immediate design priority will be to\nfinish up the temporary and basic GUI for the BasicSwap DEX. Following the\ncompletion of this item, BasicSwap will be ready for its open beta deployment. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you for your support and passion for the Particl project and\nits mission. The times standing ahead of us are incredibly interesting, and the\npath to Particl's success, as defined by the new roadmap\n[https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/], is now crystal clear.\n\nWe wish you a great weekend and will see you next week!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

Because this is a critical change, we are opting for more testing still at this time. We can report, however, that things are looking good aside from a few expected quirks here and there that get fixed as we go.</p><h3 id=\"basicswap\">BasicSwap</h3><p>Things are getting interesting on this side of things. Tecnovert is finalizing the last few items required for BasicSwap to enter its open beta phase. </p><p>Notably, an issue with coin wallets has been resolved, causing significant breaking issues in some cases. The Monero wallet has proven tricky in that case, but a solution has been developed, and the fix is \"complete\". This is not intended to be a final solution, as there are cleaner ways to do it, but it is stable enough for the open beta.</p><p>Another key missing item for the open beta is the completion of a basic GUI for the DEX. In previous updates, we've shown two previews of BasicSwap GUIs: one was a standalone client and the other an integration into the Particl Desktop client.</p><p>For the open beta, a temporary and more basic GUI will be used. Keep in mind that this phase is still an early one for the DEX and that, even if it works fine on mainnet, it will require a few manual steps from the user. In short, BasicSwap's open beta won't be a standalone client or a Particl Desktop integration; it will require a few manual (rest assured, nothing too complicated) steps to build and deploy, which will be clearly explained.</p><p>The ultimate goal is to veer away from these manual steps, but that's expected to be the case once the first \"production\" version of BasicSwap is released.</p><h3 id=\"insight-explorer\">Insight Explorer</h3><p>A <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commit/b1baa0314228c3c423a10a30c2690f5a3f10a8a3\">small fix</a></strong> has been pushed to the Insight explorer to allow spent indexes to update even if <code>addressindex</code> can't.</p><h2 id=\"particl-website-and-basicswap-gui\">Particl Website and BasicSwap GUI</h2><p>Particl's designer, Gerlof, is putting the final touches on the website and finalizing its testing.

This is a recurring task that needs to be taken care of\n   for all major releases of Particl Core, but 0.21 introduces some specific\n   changes that require particular attention in relation to the marketplace.\n * Allow users to obtain the mnemonic of the marketplace-related wallets for\n   backup purposes. This is a roadmap item and is expected to be completed\n   before the end of the weekend. Note that this item turned out to be a bit\n   more complex than initially anticipated. As a result, some back-end changes\n   were required to the profile and identity system, which will come in handy\n   later down the road.\n * A number of features related to better vendor inventory import/update, which\n   includes the provision of a product code (allowing for updates to items via\n   CSV amongst other things), the ability to update pricing via the batch\n   publish window, and the ability to import images through the CSV file\n   directly (with the possibility to specify the category and target market\n   directly from the CSV coming soon as well).\n * Usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace to allow for\n   better, more customizable formatting.\n * Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address\n   requirement (i.e., download links, NFTs, user codes, etc.).\n\nParticl Core Development Report\nThis week on Particl Core, an update to the SMSG code has been made, allowing\nfor the funding of more SMSG messages per transaction. This intends to\nstreamline the process of publishing large numbers of listings at once on the\nmarketplace. You can check the commit here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commit/592d554983bfe540ee27fefff5c124c81696e652]\n. \n\nAlso related to publishing large numbers of listings at once, an update has been\nmade here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commit/6cf14041eac381af578d1c53f0a6586a81721b7e] \nto Particl Core to fix an issue that prevented sellers, in some cases, to list a\nlarge number of listings at once (26+). These updates are all part of the team's\npost-v3 release assessment and efforts to fix immediate problems. If you\nencounter an issue with Particl V3, please report it on Particl Desktop's issue\npage located here [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues].\n\nAdditionally, more work and testing have gone towards the Particl Core 0.22\nrelease. As mentioned last week, this release is a major one and introduces\nchanges to critical pieces of the code. For this reason, thorough testing is\nrequired. Nevertheless, we are excited to report that you can now test the new\n0.22 release for yourself here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v22.0.1.0rc1]. You will\nneed to follow these instructions\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/master/contrib/guix/INSTALL.md].\n\nRelease Particl Core 22.0.1.0 RC1 · tecnovert/particl-coreRelease\nnotes:https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/blob/22.x/doc/release-notes-particl.mdHashesf38b144eabe24156b5593778c1bf54d2abeacb1fc4c335815ba505d67cbdd863\nparticl_nousb-aarch64-linux-...GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v22.0.1.0rc1]Notably\nrelated to testing new core versions, the testing of Torv3 addresses, the new\nTor address format, has started. We have also started the process of slowly\nupdating key nodes (0.21) to the new tor address format to ensure a smooth\ntransition. To connect to this node, first start the Tor Browser, then start\nParticl with this specific command: ./particl-qt -proxy=127.0.0.1:9150\n-listen=onion -onlynet=tor -debug=tor\n-connect=f4mmfkk33twzd6g7ee5mijblilygys7m6x7xaknxl7a4fsjvadwuvuqd.onion.\n\nAlso, a new version of the Trezor binaries for Particl has been released today.\nHowever, because Particl is not yet officially supported by Trezor, you will be\nrequired to manually install the custom firmware onto your device. To do it,\nfollow the instructions available here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/trezor-firmware/releases/tag/v1.11.0_particl] and \nhere [https://wiki.trezor.io/Firmware_downgrade].\n\nRelease Particl 1.11.0 · tecnovert/trezor-firmware\nHash:4b02d2c52cab218fcae016d1b9c71f935ea0fd32ec4fc132186edf05d911e2fb\ntrezor_particl_1.11.0.bin To build release\nsee:https://github.com/tecnovert/particl_scripts/tree/main/docker/trezor_compile...\nGitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/trezor-firmware/releases/tag/v1.11.0_particl]\nFinally, you can track all the changes made to Particl Core this week by\nfollowing the list of commits here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]. Suffice to say, it's\nbeen a pretty busy week!\n\nWhat's Coming Next?\nThings have been pretty busy at Particl lately, and it's expected to stay that\nway for some time. Last week, we released the long-anticipated Particl V3 on\nmainnet [https://particl.news/particl-v3-now-available-on-mainnet/]. This week, \nwe released the new development roadmap [https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/]\n. And next week, we expect to release the new website for the Particl project.\n\nNew Website\nFar from a simple refresh, the new website has been built from scratch and\nimproves on all aspects of the current one. It puts the spotlight on Particl's\nproducts, much like the roadmap does, and better tells the story of the project.\nWhat is Particl? What does it offer? How will it make your life better? And\nwhat's the ultimate purpose behind the project? The current website somehow\ndoesn't do a good enough job at answering all these questions concisely; that's\nwhat the new website fixes!\n\nThe new website is expected to help greatly converting new people into Particl\nusers. It is the focal point of any future marketing and outreach campaign and\nis the first step towards increasing the project's brand awareness.\n\nBasicSwap Open Beta\nThe next major launch event should be, if all goes well, the opening up of the\nBasicSwap beta to the public. \n\nBasicSwap is a cross-chain and private decentralized exchange powered by atomic\nswaps and the SMSG network. It lets you swap different coins, including PART,\nBTC, XMR, LTC, and others, without any intermediary. \n\nWe will start publishing more information about BasicSwap in the short term. \n\nParticl Core, Particl Desktop, and Particl Marketplace\nFollowing the long development cycle of Particl V3, we now intend on pushing\nmore constant releases. While some of the larger items of the new roadmap will\ntake some time to deliver, we've been careful to sprinkle a few short-to-medium\nitems in it to ensure a more dynamic release process. \n\nMarketing and Outreach Plans\nThere have been a lot of questions regarding what the marketing plan of the team\nis. While we have already set a few initiatives in motion, we plan to gradually\nscale up marketing, PR, and outreach efforts over the coming weeks and months as\nthe Particl ecosystem grows and becomes more accessible. But, that is not to say\nwe will sit idly by.\n\nIndeed, we have a couple of initiatives set to go live and we will publish a\nblog post shortly to explain, in more detail, the marketing and outreach plan in\nthe short-to-mid term.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe project, and the exciting journey we're embarking in with the new roadmap,\nwouldn't be possible without your support, passion, and contributions.

Suffice to say, it's been a pretty busy week!</p><h2 id=\"what-s-coming-next\">What's Coming Next?</h2><p>Things have been pretty busy at Particl lately, and it's expected to stay that way for some time. Last week, <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-v3-now-available-on-mainnet/\">we released the long-anticipated Particl V3 on mainnet</a>. This week, <a href=\"https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/\">we released the new development roadmap</a>. And next week, we expect to release the new website for the Particl project.</p><h3 id=\"new-website\">New Website</h3><p>Far from a simple refresh, the new website has been built from scratch and improves on all aspects of the current one. It puts the spotlight on Particl's products, much like the roadmap does, and better tells the story of the project. What is Particl? What does it offer? How will it make your life better? And what's the ultimate purpose behind the project? The current website somehow doesn't do a good enough job at answering all these questions concisely; that's what the new website fixes!</p><p>The new website is expected to help greatly converting new people into Particl users. It is the focal point of any future marketing and outreach campaign and is the first step towards increasing the project's brand awareness.</p><h3 id=\"basicswap-open-beta\">BasicSwap Open Beta</h3><p>The next major launch event should be, if all goes well, the opening up of the BasicSwap beta to the public. </p><p>BasicSwap is a cross-chain and private decentralized exchange powered by atomic swaps and the SMSG network. It lets you swap different coins, including PART, BTC, XMR, LTC, and others, without any intermediary. </p><p>We will start publishing more information about BasicSwap in the short term. </p><h3 id=\"particl-core-particl-desktop-and-particl-marketplace\">Particl Core, Particl Desktop, and Particl Marketplace</h3><p>Following the long development cycle of Particl V3, we now intend on pushing more constant releases. While some of the larger items of the new roadmap will take some time to deliver, we've been careful to sprinkle a few short-to-medium items in it to ensure a more dynamic release process. </p><h3 id=\"marketing-and-outreach-plans\">Marketing and Outreach Plans</h3><p>There have been a lot of questions regarding what the marketing plan of the team is. While we have already set a few initiatives in motion, we plan to gradually scale up marketing, PR, and outreach efforts over the coming weeks and months as the Particl ecosystem grows and becomes more accessible. But, that is not to say we will sit idly by.</p><p>Indeed, we have a couple of initiatives set to go live and we will publish a blog post shortly to explain, in more detail, the marketing and outreach plan in the short-to-mid term.</p><hr><p>The project, and the exciting journey we're embarking in with the new roadmap, wouldn't be possible without your support, passion, and contributions. We are infinitely grateful to have you all around and thank you from the bottom of our heart!</p><p>We wish you a great weekend; see you next week!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

mainnet\n[https://particl.news/particl-v3-now-available-on-mainnet/], it’s time to jump\nright into a new phase for the Particl project. As such, we are happy to release\nthe new updated development roadmap and major milestones ahead of us.\n\nIn this post, we’ll expand on Particl’s vision for the future and break down\nevery roadmap item. We also have a few words on marketing, PR, adoption, and the\nnew website so make sure to read this blog post in full!\n\nTable of Contents\n * Particl V3\n * Roadmap objectives\n * Discover the new roadmap\n * BasicSwap Open Beta\n * Web framework\n * What about marketing?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl V3 – The Foundation of Particl's entire ecosystem\nThe release of Particl V3 on mainnet represents a major milestone for the\nproject. Indeed, Particl V3 is the new, more modern foundation on top of which\nthe future of the Particl ecosystem will be built. Because the scope of this\nessential update was so massive, it took a long time to get ready but was a\nnecessary step in the evolution of the project.\n\nIndeed, Particl V3’s modular approach makes it easier and more efficient to use\napps like Particl Marketplace. Still, many of its improvements are back-end\nfunctionalities and necessary improvements to the quality of the code. Simply\nput, all the changes introduced with Particl V3 make possible the majority of\nthe roadmap items presented today.\n\nRoadmap Objectives\nThe roadmap has been designed with three simple but powerful objectives in mind.\n\nImprove Particl’s accessibility and make it easier to use for a wider range of\naudiences.\nParticl Desktop and the apps it hosts is still a relatively complex application\nthat can be rough around the edges and requires some learning to use. Of course,\nthis is to be expected during the pioneering phase of any groundbreaking\ntechnology, but it makes it harder to capture casual users. This is why making\nParticl as accessible and easy to use as possible is vital to Particl’s success.\n\nImprove the marketplace with features that can directly lead to more adoption.\nBecause Particl Marketplace is still in beta, a few essential features,\nfunctionalities, and options are still missing to this day. Without these, a lot\nof sellers and buyers may find the marketplace too limited to use it. Therefore,\nthe Particl team is opting to adopt a strategical mindset and prioritize the\ndevelopment of the features and functionalities that are the most likely to\ngenerate adoption.\n\nImprove Particl’s scalability and stability in prevision for a wider level of\nadoption.\nIn a world that increasingly needs solutions like Particl, the rate of adoption\nof the platform can rocket up exponentially. For this reason, it needs to be\nready to support large numbers of users, transactions, and messages with no\ndowntime, perceivable lag, or other similar problems. To ensure that this is the\ncase, improving the platform’s scalability and stability has been an important\nfactor in the conception of this roadmap.\n\nDiscover the New Roadmap\nDue to the large size of the roadmap, it has been separated in different\ncategories to make it more digestible. This roadmap is a living, non-linear\ndocument. The team is expected to jump on and off and work on multiple tasks at\na time depending on various factors.\n\nTags\nOn the roadmap just below, you may see items that contain tags. Each tag\nrepresents a different status.\n\n * Completed: The roadmap item has either been completed or a first significant\n   version of it has been deployed.\n * In progress: The roadmap item is currently being worked on, or has already\n   started being worked on.\n * Research: The roadmap item either requires more research or is currently\n   under research.\n * Ongoing: The roadmap item is a recurring task over time.\n * Later: The roadmap item is scheduled for later time than most other roadmap\n   items in the list.\n * [NO TAG]: The roadmap item is not currently being worked on at the moment,\n   but could be picked up after other roadmap items are delivered.\n\nMajor Milestones\nBasicSwap DEX  What?\nA cross-chain, private, and decentralized exchange (DEX) powered by atomic swaps\nand SMSG.\n\nWhy?\nBasicSwap is Particl's native decentralized exchange powered by atomic swaps and\nSMSG. It lets you swap a vast number of coins privately without anyone in\nbetween and without paying trading fees. BasicSwap is compatible with multiple\ncoins like PART, BTC, XMR, LTC, and more. \n\nIn progress Closed beta SMSG 2.0  What?\nA new version of SMSG that is significantly more scalable.\n\nWhy?\nAs Particl's adoption increases and more Particl apps use SMSG as its backbone,\nSMSG 2.0 ensures that the network can scale appropriately. This massive update\nwill make it possible to support all current and upcoming Particl apps without\nany scaling issue. \n\nResearch Lightning Network GUI  What?\nA user-friendly interface for Particl's Lightning Network.\n\nWhy?\nParticl's Lightning Network is already live on mainnet, but there's currently no\neasy way to use it. Particl Electrum provides a user-friendly interface for\neveryone to enjoy all the benefits of the Lightning Network; near-infinite\ntransaction scalability, near-zero fees, near-instant settlements, and more. \n\nIn progress Web framework (marketplace on the web)  What?\nA web framework to bring the Particl ecosystem to the web.\n\nWhy?\nFor Particl to gain maximum adoption, it needs to be accessible and operable\nthrough the web. Particl's planned web framework will allow apps like the\nmarketplace, for example, to be available from web pages. The web framework is\nexpected to be deployed incrementally. For example, a web-based listing browser\nmay be deployed initially, on which new features and functionalities (i.e.,\nsearch engine friendly content) will be added over time. \n\nLater Research Encrypted messaging app  What?\nA decentralized, private, and encrypted messaging/chat app.\n\nWhy?\nThe SMSG network is, at its core, a distributed messaging network. With a proper\ninterface, it can be used as a messaging application that's fast, secure,\nunstoppable, uncensorable, and private. This \"chat\" functionality may come in\ndifferent packages over time (i.e., Particl Desktop app, integration into the\nmarketplace, mobile app, etc.). \n\nLater \"Major milestones\" are the most important deliverables of the new roadmap.\nThey are major releases that introduce key functionalities to the Particl\necosystem and craft the path forward. They will massively contribute to\nimproving Particl and its adoption by making it more stable, resilient, private,\nand scalable. \n\nThese milestones are not necessarily intended to be worked on one right after\nthe other. They usually require other roadmap items to be completed before they\ncan be started, meaning the development focus is spread across all roadmap\ncategories and not just this one.\n\nOther Categories\nRoadmap items related to the marketplace, desktop client, SMSG network, or the\nblockchain are grouped into their own categories. They are important features,\nadditions, and improvements to the components and products of the Particl\necosystem that already exist. \n\nAlthough these roadmap items are not included in the \"major milestones\"\ncategory, they are just as important and provide direct value to the ecosystem\nand improves its adoption potential by making it more accessible, usable, and\nfeature-complete.\n\nBlockchain and Coin\nImproved zap functionality  What?\nAn improved zap function that gives stakers more flexibility and privacy.\n\nWhy?\nThe new zap function makes it more efficient and confidential to zap funds when\nactivating cold staking. \n\nCompleted Particl Electrum  What?\nA Particl version of the Electrum light wallet, with Lightning Network GUI\nincluded.\n\nWhy?\nElectrum is an easy-to-use and popular light wallet that introduces various\nfeatures and capabilities. One of them is a GUI for using Particl's Lightning\nNetwork. Electrum will not only make it easy to use the Lightning Network, but\nit's also expected to serve as the backbone for future components of the Particl\necosystem. \n\nIn progress Taproot support  What?\nA new protocol that brings new, more efficient, flexible, and private ways to\ntransact PART.\n\nWhy?\nThe Taproot update includes many new features and capabilities, notably in the\narea of privacy. This update is particularly interesting considering the complex\ntransactions generated by Particl's apps like the marketplace and the upcoming\nBasicSwap DEX. Taproot is expected to improve their privacy even more and reduce\nfees. \n\nPending activation Trezor wallet support  What?\nA better support for Trezor hardware devices.\n\nWhy?\nTrezor is a hardware device that lets users safely store coins offline. Having\nnew hardware storage solution for Particl provides users with yet another safe\nway to store coins the way they prefer. \n\nIn progress New blockchain explorers  What?\nThe deployment of new blockchain explorers.\n\nWhy?\nMany different blockchain explorers provide additional data that Particl's\ncurrent primary blockchain explorer (Insight) doesn't. For this reason, having\nmore blockchain explorers opens up the door to new opportunities, such as\nenabling Particl's upcoming web framework. \n\nIn progress Scaling and performance upgrades  What?\nA wide range of planned improvements to make Particl more scalable, stable, and\nfast.\n\nWhy?\nAs Particl's adoption grows, the ecosystem has to support the increased traffic.\nIt also needs to be able to process a large number of transactions and SMSG\nmessages. Various improvements are planned as part of the regular Particl Core\nupdates to ensure that this is the case. \n\nOngoing PSBT support  What?\nA unified and more advanced multi-signature format.\n\nWhy?\nPSBT is a more modern multi-signature protocol that improves on current\nmulti-signature solutions. It makes it easier to use for wallets and nodes, and\nmakes it compatible across more devices. PSBT also enables better CoinJoin-like\nfunctionality. \n\nShamir's secret-sharing for mnemonics (SSS)  What?\nAn improvement to how mnemonics work in deterministic wallets.\n\nWhy?\nSSS is a new, improved format for deterministic wallet mnemonics that \"splits a\nmaster secret into unique parts which can be distributed among participants. A\nspecified minimum number of parts is required to be supplied in order to\nreconstruct the original secret. Knowledge of fewer than the required number of\nparts does not leak information about the master secret.\" \n\nMarketplace\nImproved inventory import  What?\nMore features to the current inventory import tool. Includes importing images,\ncategories, product codes, and more right from a CSV file.\n\nWhy?\nMakes it easier and less time-consuming for large-scale vendors to open shop on\nParticl Marketplace. Currently, many operations still require a manual,\none-by-one operation which is a tedious process for vendors with hundreds of\nlistings. \n\nIn progress Additional shipping and delivery options  What?\nAdditional shipping and delivery options to satisfy more needs (per country\nshipping costs, digital item deliveries, etc.).\n\nWhy?\nAdding more shipping options helps sellers charge a more accurate shipping cost\ndepending on the buyer's location and shipping preference. This roadmap item\nalso includes new delivery methods for digital items, such as buyers providing a\ncrypto address (i.e., NFTs) or a user code/username, for example. \n\nIn progress Escrow improvements  What?\nA wide range of escrow improvements to satisfy more use-cases.\n\nWhy?\nAt this time, escrow is mandatory on all transactions and requires a 100%\nsecurity deposit rate. However, its current form may not be ideal for all types\nof transactions, sellers, and buyers. For this reason, a wide range of escrow\nimprovements and options are planned to be deployed. This includes making escrow\noptional and introducing new features like an auto-destroy timer, an\nauto-complete timer, an adjustable security deposit requirement, partial\nrefunds, and automation to reduce the number of steps required in the buy flow.\nAll these escrow features are optional, leaving users with multiple options to\nsatisfy their needs. \n\nIn progress Research Advanced inventory management  What?\nAn inventory management tool that lets sellers indicate the quantity in stock\nfor each of their listings. It also lets them set up variants for items with\nmultiple purchasing options (i.e., color, size, etc.).\n\nWhy?\nThis tool significantly improves the marketplace by introducing a key e-commerce\nfeature to specify the number of available quantities. In addition, instead of\ncreating multiple listings of the same item, sellers with products containing\nvariants (i.e., storage size for USB keys) will be able to let buyers choose\ntheir purchasing preferences from a single listing. \n\nNew types of order  What?\nAdded support for new types of orders, such as bidding auctions.\n\nWhy?\nAllows the marketplace to provide a different experience for different types of\nusers, products, and niches. For example, the art industry heavily uses bidding\nauctions and may be more inclined to use the marketplace if this feature is\nenabled. \n\nPrice pegging and custom display  What?\nThe ability to dynamically adjust and display listing prices based on the value\nof other currencies (i.e., USD).\n\nWhy?\nDue to PART's price fluctuation, many users may prefer pricing and viewing\nlistings based on different currencies (i.e., USD, EUR, BTC). This roadmap item\ndepends on price oracles, which is a future functionality provided by Particl\nDesktop plugins (SMSG bots). \n\nLater Reputation system  What?\nA reputation system, best used in combination with Particl's escrow.\n\nWhy?\nBefore transacting, both the seller and the buyer want to ensure that the other\nparty is trustworthy. A reputation system is a tool that helps with making that\nassessment. It provides additional information about the other user and, when\ncombined with Particl's unique escrow system, offers a strong level of\nconfidence and protection when trading with strangers. \n\nLater Research Buy flow messaging  What?\nThe ability to talk with the other participant during a marketplace transaction.\n\nWhy?\nThere are a lot of situations where both participants of a marketplace\ntransaction may want to communicate together. Whether that's for asking a\nquestion before buying, providing an update, or dealing with a shipping issue, a\nbuilt-in messaging system massively improves the user experience and helps\nresolve order-related issues. \n\nAdditional market permissions  What?\nThe ability for a market owner to set special permissions for other users.\n\nWhy?\nA market owner may want to make their market or storefront invite-only, or they\nmay wish to elect moderators. This feature makes community markets and\nstorefronts more versatile, leading to more potential use-cases. \n\nResearch Moderation system update  What?\nImprovements to the marketplace's moderation system.\n\nWhy?\nAs no central authority has the power to control the marketplace and its\ncontent, the community is the one in charge of moderation. The current system is\na basic process that lets anyone flag undesirable content. Several improvements\nare being considered, notably in relation to cold staking pools and AI systems.\nImproving the moderation system and its capabilities will make it more effective\nand lead to more people using it. \n\nResearch Webhook integrations  What?\nThe ability for Particl Marketplace to connect with third-party services.\n\nWhy?\nWhile the marketplace is entirely decentralized, users can manually add\nthird-party services through app extensions and plugins. Webhook integrations\nare such services that can be manually added. They allow the marketplace to\nconnect to external platforms that provide services like inventory management,\naccounting, external notifications, etc. Any platform or person can deploy their\nown integration; the possibilities are endless. \n\nIn progress Other DSN integrations (i.e., IPFS)  What?\nThe ability to host large-size content like images on different data network\nsystems (DSN).\n\nWhy?\nImages make up for the majority of the data contained in SMSG messages. Hosting\nlarge-size content on external networks clears a lot of space on the SMSG\nnetwork, allowing it to scale better and be more efficient. Additionally, other\nDSNs may provide features and functionalities not natively supported by SMSG,\nopening up the doors to more opportunities. \n\nResearch Stable payments  What?\nA way to ensure the stability of the value of payments made on the marketplace.\n\nWhy?\nPART's price volatility is not ideal for many e-commerce activities and users,\nespecially those focused on tight margin requirements. Enabling a way to improve\nthe stability of marketplace payments against other currencies (i.e., USD) is a\nmajor improvement that will tremendously help with usability and predictability.\nThis is a major milestone towards large-scale adoption, but it is not a\nnear-future roadmap item. In the meantime, \"fiat\" payment gateways may be\nintegrated on Particl Desktop using plugins. \n\nLater Research Other features and improvements  What?\nA wide range of minor marketplace features and general improvements.\n\nWhy?\nA wide range of more minor features and general improvements is planned as part\nof Particl Desktop's regular release schedule. These additions usually take less\ntime to get ready and can come up due to user feedback or problems encountered.\nA few examples of such features include unique listing identifiers, markdown\nformatting for listing descriptions, additional listing browser view options,\noptional text fields for compliance, and many more to be added over time. The\nteam wants to keep a flexible approach to development and expects a few features\nand improvements to require to be added suddenly. \n\nOngoing Desktop\nSMSG controller  What?\nA system that allows apps and developers to interact with the SMSG network more\neffectively.\n\nWhy?\nA streamlined process for interacting with the SMSG network is required for apps\nand developers to easily and safely interact with the SMSG network. The SMSG\nmanager also provides various failsafe mechanisms and massively increases SMSG's\ncompatibility with future apps other than the marketplace. It's an important\nstep towards making Particl more developer-friendly. \n\nCore and Desktop separation  What?\nBetter separation of Particl Core and Particl Desktop.\n\nWhy?\nMaking Particl Desktop even more independent of Particl Core makes the client\nmore efficient. This improves the quality of the code making other features and\nfunctionalities easier to maintain and deploy. \n\nApp extensions and plugins  What?\nSupport for app extensions and plugins to provide third-party functionalities to\nthe desktop client.\n\nWhy?\nParticl is an entirely decentralized network and functions without any\nthird-party intervention. However, intermediaries may provide helpful services\nand features that may benefit users (i.e., data oracles, crypto swap services,\netc.). The app extension and plugin system lets anyone broadcast and add\nthird-party services on Particl Desktop. \n\nCore configuration editor  What?\nA system that lets users modify configuration settings, such as easily enabling\nTor routing.\n\nWhy?\nManually editing Particl Core configuration files can provide a lot of extra\nfunctionalities to users, but it can also break things in unexpected ways. A\nconfig management system lets the user tweak these low-level settings without\nany potential issue. This can be useful, for example, to easily connect to the\nTor network. \n\nIn progress Wallet encryption options  What?\nThe ability to delete the encryption of a wallet or change its password.\n\nWhy?\nThere are many situations where a user may want to delete the encryption of a\nwallet or change its password. This is what this roadmap item introduces. \n\nBetter cold staking functionality  What?\nMove staking and cold staking to a separate section or app.\n\nWhy?\nMaking a separate section or app for staking (and cold staking) allows for a\nbetter way to provide more options and features. This makes staking and cold\nstaking more intuitive and powerful. \n\nOS notifications  What?\nThe addition of various push notifications to the user's operating system.\n\nWhy?\nReceiving notifications through your operating system lets you stay connected\nand up-to-date with what's going on with your Particl-related activities.\nNotifications can be pushed for many different events such as a marketplace\norder update, an inbound PART transaction, a completed escrow, etc. \n\nWant to Suggest a New Feature or Improvement?\nYour feedback and ideas are incredibly valuable! If you have any feature,\nimprovement, or functionality suggestion, we highly encourage you to let us know\nabout it.\n\nSimply head over to the appropriate Issue page (i.e., Particl Desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] or Particl Core\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/issues]), and create a new issue with\nthe \"Feature Request\" option. This way, you are sure that a Particl developer\nwill see your suggestion.\n\nKeep Track of Things\nTo keep track of the progress made on these roadmap items, we publish, every\nweek on Friday, a development progress report on Particl News\n[https://particl.news/]. This is the best way to stay up-to-date with all the\ndevelopments and updates. \n\nThis roadmap will also have its own separate page on the new Particl.io\n[https://Particl.io/] website. It will be regularly updated as new items are\nadded, completed or moved to the \"in progress\" phase. \n\nBasicSwap Open Beta\nBasicSwap is scheduled to be the next major release for Particl. It's a\ncross-chain and private decentralized exchange powered by atomic swaps and the\nSMSG network. It lets you swap different coins, including PART, BTC, XMR, LTC,\nand others without any intermediary. While the DEX is currently in its closed\nbeta phase, it already works over mainnet, with several successful swaps having\ntaken place during the last few weeks.\n\nParticl's core developer Tecnovert is working, at this moment, on some required\ntweaks to the SMSG network and is putting the final touches to the DEX before it\ncan be considered ready for the deployment of its open beta phase.\n\nAs we are rapidly nearing the launch of BasicSwap's open beta, you can expect\nmuch more information about it to be released shortly on Particl News\n[https://particl.news/]. So buckle up because Particl is just about to become\ninvincible!\n\nWeb Framework\nMaking Particl Marketplace and other apps, like BasicSwap, available from the\nweb with full (or nearly full) functionality is a critical milestone in making\nParticl more accessible, user-friendly, and likely to get massive levels of\nadoption. This is what the \"web framework\" does.\n\nHowever, accessibility is one thing, usability is another. Because many other\nvital features need to be integrated into the marketplace to make it more\nfunctional, the web framework is scheduled for later while other essential\nroadmap items (additional marketplace features and functionalities) get more\nimmediate focus.\n\nAdditionally, the web framework depends on other roadmap items, such as\nalternative block explorers, for example. Due to the many moving pieces required\nto fall in place for the web framework to be deployed, it is currently marked as\n\"Later\" and \"Research\". In other words, it's contextually not an immediate\npriority but is one of the most critical points of the current roadmap. \n\nJust like most major items on this roadmap, we will publish more information\nabout it when its time comes.\n\nWhat About Marketing?\nNow that the new foundation for the Particl ecosystem, Particl V3, is live on\nmainnet, the team can now gradually ramp up marketing, brand awareness\ncampaigns, and outreach efforts. This process is already ongoing, with a few\ninitiatives already being live and with many more in line.\n\nOn that topic, we will publish, very shortly, a detailed blog post about\nParticl's vision moving forward, especially in regards to marketing and\nadoption. This will be an important publication that will shine a light on\nParticl's vision and mission, as well as on how the team intends to make the\nplatform successful.\n\nHowever, it's essential to consider that Particl Desktop and the marketplace are\nstill in beta, meaning that they may be a bit rough around the edges and\ncomplicated to use for some. For this reason, Particl's marketing strategy is\nintended to gradually ramp up as the products themselves evolve and target the\naudiences that are the most likely to adopt Particl in its current form, with\nthe features available at the time.\n\nThe New Website is Key\nThe new website is critical in making any marketing effort successful. It is\nwhere newcomers, those introduced to Particl through marketing campaigns, are\nthe most likely to land and get their first impression. A website is a project's\nmost crucial marketing statement.\n\nTo that effect, the new website is a massive improvement over the current one,\nimproving on every single aspect. It makes Particl's vision and values much\nclearer and better tells the project's story. It also puts the spotlight on\nParticl's various applications, ensuring everybody knows precisely what the\nproject has to offer to them.\n\nWe are very confident that the new website will dramatically improve the\nconversion of curious people into engaged users. It will play a massive part in\nmaking future marketing, PR, and outreach campaigns more successful.\n\n> Note: Initially scheduled to launch this week, we have to postpone the new\nwebsite release to next week. One of our team members involved with its\ndevelopment has faced health issues that rendered him unavailable for several\ndays this week and, for this reason, couldn't complete the final parts in time.\nThis team member is now recovering fine.\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nIf you haven’t already done so, we invite you to subscribe to our newsletter so\nthat you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive content.

Indeed, Particl V3 is the new, more modern foundation on top of which the future of the Particl ecosystem will be built. Because the scope of this essential update was so massive, it took a long time to get ready but was a necessary step in the evolution of the project.</p><p>Indeed, Particl V3’s modular approach makes it easier and more efficient to use apps like Particl Marketplace. Still, many of its improvements are back-end functionalities and necessary improvements to the quality of the code. Simply put, all the changes introduced with Particl V3 make possible the majority of the roadmap items presented today.</p><h2 id=\"roadmap-objectives\">Roadmap Objectives</h2><p>The roadmap has been designed with three simple but powerful objectives in mind.</p><p><strong>Improve Particl’s accessibility and make it easier to use for a wider range of audiences.</strong><br>Particl Desktop and the apps it hosts is still a relatively complex application that can be rough around the edges and requires some learning to use. Of course, this is to be expected during the pioneering phase of any groundbreaking technology, but it makes it harder to capture casual users. This is why making Particl as accessible and easy to use as possible is vital to Particl’s success.</p><p><strong>Improve the marketplace with features that can directly lead to more adoption.</strong><br>Because Particl Marketplace is still in beta, a few essential features, functionalities, and options are still missing to this day. Without these, a lot of sellers and buyers may find the marketplace too limited to use it. Therefore, the Particl team is opting to adopt a strategical mindset and prioritize the development of the features and functionalities that are the most likely to generate adoption.</p><p><strong>Improve Particl’s scalability and stability in prevision for a wider level of adoption.</strong><br>In a world that increasingly needs solutions like Particl, the rate of adoption of the platform can rocket up exponentially. For this reason, it needs to be ready to support large numbers of users, transactions, and messages with no downtime, perceivable lag, or other similar problems. To ensure that this is the case, improving the platform’s scalability and stability has been an important factor in the conception of this roadmap.</p><h2 id=\"discover-the-new-roadmap\">Discover the New Roadmap</h2><p>Due to the large size of the roadmap, it has been separated in different categories to make it more digestible. This roadmap is a living, non-linear document. The team is expected to jump on and off and work on multiple tasks at a time depending on various factors.</p><h3 id=\"tags\">Tags</h3><p>On the roadmap just below, you may see items that contain tags.

Particl's planned web framework will allow apps like the marketplace, for example, to be available from web pages. The web framework is expected to be deployed incrementally. For example, a web-based listing browser may be deployed initially, on which new features and functionalities (i.e., search engine friendly content) will be added over time.\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Later</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Research</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck5\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck5\">Encrypted messaging app</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            <b>What?</b></br>\n                            A decentralized, private, and encrypted messaging/chat app.</br></br>\n                            <b>Why?</b></br>\n                            The SMSG network is, at its core, a distributed messaging network.

While the DEX is currently in its closed beta phase, it already works over mainnet, with several successful swaps having taken place during the last few weeks.</p><p>Particl's core developer Tecnovert is working, at this moment, on some required tweaks to the SMSG network and is putting the final touches to the DEX before it can be considered ready for the deployment of its open beta phase.</p><p>As we are rapidly nearing the launch of BasicSwap's open beta, you can expect much more information about it to be released shortly on <a href=\"https://particl.news/\">Particl News</a>. So buckle up because Particl is just about to become invincible!</p><h2 id=\"web-framework\">Web Framework</h2><p>Making Particl Marketplace and other apps, like BasicSwap, available from the web with full (or nearly full) functionality is a critical milestone in making Particl more accessible, user-friendly, and likely to get massive levels of adoption. This is what the \"web framework\" does.</p><p>However, accessibility is one thing, usability is another. Because many other vital features need to be integrated into the marketplace to make it more functional, the web framework is scheduled for later while other essential roadmap items (additional marketplace features and functionalities) get more immediate focus.</p><p>Additionally, the web framework depends on other roadmap items, such as alternative block explorers, for example. Due to the many moving pieces required to fall in place for the web framework to be deployed, it is currently marked as \"Later\" and \"Research\". In other words, it's contextually not an immediate priority but is one of the most critical points of the current roadmap. </p><p>Just like most major items on this roadmap, we will publish more information about it when its time comes.</p><h2 id=\"what-about-marketing\">What About Marketing?</h2><p>Now that the new foundation for the Particl ecosystem, Particl V3, is live on mainnet, the team can now gradually ramp up marketing, brand awareness campaigns, and outreach efforts. This process is already ongoing, with a few initiatives already being live and with many more in line.</p><p>On that topic, we will publish, very shortly, a detailed blog post about Particl's vision moving forward, especially in regards to marketing and adoption. This will be an important publication that will shine a light on Particl's vision and mission, as well as on how the team intends to make the platform successful.</p><p>However, it's essential to consider that Particl Desktop and the marketplace are still in beta, meaning that they may be a bit rough around the edges and complicated to use for some. For this reason, Particl's marketing strategy is intended to gradually ramp up as the products themselves evolve and target the audiences that are the most likely to adopt Particl in its current form, with the features available at the time.</p><h3 id=\"the-new-website-is-key\">The New Website is Key</h3><p>The new website is critical in making any marketing effort successful. It is where newcomers, those introduced to Particl through marketing campaigns, are the most likely to land and get their first impression. A website is a project's most crucial marketing statement.</p><p>To that effect, the new website is a massive improvement over the current one, improving on every single aspect. It makes Particl's vision and values much clearer and better tells the project's story. It also puts the spotlight on Particl's various applications, ensuring everybody knows precisely what the project has to offer to them.</p><p>We are very confident that the new website will dramatically improve the conversion of curious people into engaged users. It will play a massive part in making future marketing, PR, and outreach campaigns more successful.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> Initially scheduled to launch this week, we have to postpone the new website release to next week. One of our team members involved with its development has faced health issues that rendered him unavailable for several days this week and, for this reason, couldn't complete the final parts in time. This team member is now recovering fine.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"subscribe-to-our-newsletter\">Subscribe to our Newsletter</h2><p>If you haven’t already done so, we invite you to subscribe to our newsletter so that you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive content.

Indeed, Particl V3 is the new, more modern foundation on top of which the future of the Particl ecosystem will be built. Because the scope of this essential update was so massive, it took a long time to get ready but was a necessary step in the evolution of the project.</p><p>Indeed, Particl V3’s modular approach makes it easier and more efficient to use apps like Particl Marketplace. Still, many of its improvements are back-end functionalities and necessary improvements to the quality of the code. Simply put, all the changes introduced with Particl V3 make possible the majority of the roadmap items presented today.</p><h2 id=\"roadmap-objectives\">Roadmap Objectives</h2><p>The roadmap has been designed with three simple but powerful objectives in mind.</p><p><strong>Improve Particl’s accessibility and make it easier to use for a wider range of audiences.</strong><br>Particl Desktop and the apps it hosts is still a relatively complex application that can be rough around the edges and requires some learning to use. Of course, this is to be expected during the pioneering phase of any groundbreaking technology, but it makes it harder to capture casual users. This is why making Particl as accessible and easy to use as possible is vital to Particl’s success.</p><p><strong>Improve the marketplace with features that can directly lead to more adoption.</strong><br>Because Particl Marketplace is still in beta, a few essential features, functionalities, and options are still missing to this day. Without these, a lot of sellers and buyers may find the marketplace too limited to use it. Therefore, the Particl team is opting to adopt a strategical mindset and prioritize the development of the features and functionalities that are the most likely to generate adoption.</p><p><strong>Improve Particl’s scalability and stability in prevision for a wider level of adoption.</strong><br>In a world that increasingly needs solutions like Particl, the rate of adoption of the platform can rocket up exponentially. For this reason, it needs to be ready to support large numbers of users, transactions, and messages with no downtime, perceivable lag, or other similar problems. To ensure that this is the case, improving the platform’s scalability and stability has been an important factor in the conception of this roadmap.</p><h2 id=\"discover-the-new-roadmap\">Discover the New Roadmap</h2><p>Due to the large size of the roadmap, it has been separated in different categories to make it more digestible. This roadmap is a living, non-linear document. The team is expected to jump on and off and work on multiple tasks at a time depending on various factors.</p><h3 id=\"tags\">Tags</h3><p>On the roadmap just below, you may see items that contain tags. Each tag represents a different status.</p><ul><li><strong>Completed: </strong>The roadmap item has either been completed or a first significant version of it has been deployed.</li><li><strong>In progress:</strong> The roadmap item is currently being worked on, or has already started being worked on.</li><li><strong>Research:</strong> The roadmap item either requires more research or is currently under research.</li><li><strong>Ongoing:</strong> The roadmap item is a recurring task over time.</li><li><strong>Later:</strong> The roadmap item is scheduled for later time than most other roadmap items in the list.</li><li><strong>[NO TAG]:</strong> The roadmap item is not currently being worked on at the moment, but could be picked up after other roadmap items are delivered.</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <h2>Major Milestones</h2>\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">BasicSwap DEX</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            <b>What?</b><br>\n                            A cross-chain, private, and decentralized exchange (DEX) powered by atomic swaps and SMSG.<br><br>\n                            <b>Why?</b><br>\n                            BasicSwap is Particl's native decentralized exchange powered by atomic swaps and SMSG.

Particl's planned web framework will allow apps like the marketplace, for example, to be available from web pages. The web framework is expected to be deployed incrementally. For example, a web-based listing browser may be deployed initially, on which new features and functionalities (i.e., search engine friendly content) will be added over time.\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Later</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Research</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck5\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck5\">Encrypted messaging app</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            <b>What?</b><br>\n                            A decentralized, private, and encrypted messaging/chat app.<br><br>\n                            <b>Why?</b><br>\n                            The SMSG network is, at its core, a distributed messaging network.

While the DEX is currently in its closed beta phase, it already works over mainnet, with several successful swaps having taken place during the last few weeks.</p><p>Particl's core developer Tecnovert is working, at this moment, on some required tweaks to the SMSG network and is putting the final touches to the DEX before it can be considered ready for the deployment of its open beta phase.</p><p>As we are rapidly nearing the launch of BasicSwap's open beta, you can expect much more information about it to be released shortly on <a href=\"https://particl.news/\">Particl News</a>. So buckle up because Particl is just about to become invincible!</p><h2 id=\"web-framework\">Web Framework</h2><p>Making Particl Marketplace and other apps, like BasicSwap, available from the web with full (or nearly full) functionality is a critical milestone in making Particl more accessible, user-friendly, and likely to get massive levels of adoption. This is what the \"web framework\" does.</p><p>However, accessibility is one thing, usability is another. Because many other vital features need to be integrated into the marketplace to make it more functional, the web framework is scheduled for later while other essential roadmap items (additional marketplace features and functionalities) get more immediate focus.</p><p>Additionally, the web framework depends on other roadmap items, such as alternative block explorers, for example. Due to the many moving pieces required to fall in place for the web framework to be deployed, it is currently marked as \"Later\" and \"Research\". In other words, it's contextually not an immediate priority but is one of the most critical points of the current roadmap. </p><p>Just like most major items on this roadmap, we will publish more information about it when its time comes.</p><h2 id=\"what-about-marketing\">What About Marketing?</h2><p>Now that the new foundation for the Particl ecosystem, Particl V3, is live on mainnet, the team can now gradually ramp up marketing, brand awareness campaigns, and outreach efforts. This process is already ongoing, with a few initiatives already being live and with many more in line.</p><p>On that topic, we will publish, very shortly, a detailed blog post about Particl's vision moving forward, especially in regards to marketing and adoption. This will be an important publication that will shine a light on Particl's vision and mission, as well as on how the team intends to make the platform successful.</p><p>However, it's essential to consider that Particl Desktop and the marketplace are still in beta, meaning that they may be a bit rough around the edges and complicated to use for some. For this reason, Particl's marketing strategy is intended to gradually ramp up as the products themselves evolve and target the audiences that are the most likely to adopt Particl in its current form, with the features available at the time.</p><h3 id=\"the-new-website-is-key\">The New Website is Key</h3><p>The new website is critical in making any marketing effort successful. It is where newcomers, those introduced to Particl through marketing campaigns, are the most likely to land and get their first impression. A website is a project's most crucial marketing statement.</p><p>To that effect, the new website is a massive improvement over the current one, improving on every single aspect. It makes Particl's vision and values much clearer and better tells the project's story. It also puts the spotlight on Particl's various applications, ensuring everybody knows precisely what the project has to offer to them.</p><p>We are very confident that the new website will dramatically improve the conversion of curious people into engaged users. It will play a massive part in making future marketing, PR, and outreach campaigns more successful.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> Initially scheduled to launch this week, we have to postpone the new website release to next week. One of our team members involved with its development has faced health issues that rendered him unavailable for several days this week and, for this reason, couldn't complete the final parts in time. This team member is now recovering fine.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"subscribe-to-our-newsletter\">Subscribe to our Newsletter</h2><p>If you haven’t already done so, we invite you to subscribe to our newsletter so that you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive content.

comes the weekly\ndevelopment progress report. This week has been a pretty busy one, and so we\nhave quite a lot to report.\n\nFirst thing first, this week has seen the release of the long-anticipated\nParticl V3 on mainnet, which includes the new Particl Desktop client and Particl\nMarketplace. We're happy to report that the release has gone exceptionally\nsmoothly without any significant issue. A few minor problems have been reported\nconcerning getting listings to show up, but they can be quickly remediated with\na few manual steps that we are working on fixing. The related changes to fix\nthose minor issues should go live pretty soon.\n\nAdditionally, a good portion of this week's focus has been on observing the\nnetwork following the release, keeping an eye on the chat rooms to spot any\nproblem and assist people with difficulties, and also answering many questions\nfrom the community both in the chat rooms, but also in private messages.\n\nParticl V3, now finally on mainnet!However, it's not because a lot of the focus\nhas been around monitoring the release that there hasn't been any significant\nprogress development-wise. In fact, it is quite the contrary; this has been a\npretty productive week. So let's dive deeper into the details.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Development Report\nA small number of minor updates have been added and queued up for the next\nrelease of Particl Desktop. Thanks to everyone who's provided feedback (and\ncontinue to do so) based on their experience with the initial Particl V3\nrelease.\n\nIn addition, here are the items that have seen progress this week but aren't yet\nfully ready.\n\n * Update Particl Desktop and particl-market (marketplace codebase) to use\n   Particl Core 0.21.\n * Allow users to obtain the mnemonic of the marketplace-related wallets for\n   backup purposes.\n * A number of features related to better vendor inventory import/update, which\n   includes the provision of a product code (allowing for updates to items via\n   CSV amongst other things), the ability to update pricing via the batch\n   publish window, and the ability to import images through the CSV file\n   directly (with the possibility to specify the category and target market\n   directly from the CSV coming soon as well).\n * Usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace to allow for\n   better, more customizable formatting. \n * Allowing for the sale of digital items with no need for a shipping address to\n   be provided (i.e., download links, NFTs, user codes, etc.).\n\nParticl Core Development Report\nMost of the work on the core side of things this week has been around fixing\nminor issues related to Core and its interaction with the marketplace. Still,\nthere have also been some pretty interesting independent development.\n\nParticl Core 0.19.2.15\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.15] and 0.19.2.16\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.16] have been\nreleased to address a few edge issues with Particl Desktop, especially as it\nrelates to improperly shutting down Particl Desktop, which caused, in some\ninstances, problems with syncing the blockchain correctly and loading listings\nas expected. Particl Core 0.19.2.16 will soon be pushed to Particl Desktop;\nyou'll need to shut down the client entirely and re-open it for the update to\napply. \n\nAdditionally, work has gone towards making the Particl Core 0.21 release\ncompatible with Particl Desktop. This, however, is still a work in progress but\nwill mark a significant step towards moving away from the old 0.19 release and\ntowards a more modern one.\n\nFinally, we have exciting news to share in relation to Particl Core 0.22. The\nfirst internal pre-release has been built and is being tested at this very\nmoment. This is the first time a Bitcoin/Particl release uses guix, which treats \nlibudev differently. For this reason, this release, in particular, needs to be\nextensively tested to ensure everything runs as expected. \n\nFor a full list of all the changes being introduced, follow this link\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-22.0.md]\n. In a nutshell, it introduces i2p routing, drops TorV2 addresses for the new\nTorv3 ones, and more necessary code for the full deployment of the\nprivacy-enhancing taproot protocol, which, in Particl's case, is expected to\ncome to play an essential role in BasicSwap notably (to allow for more private\nswaps that are indistinguishable from regular transactions). \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStay tuned as the next week is gearing up to be another productive one. The new\nwebsite, and the new roadmap, are both scheduled to be released next week, and\nthey are sure to melt your mind! Keep in mind that, shortly after this, we'll\nalso start publishing a lot more information about Particl's new upcoming app;\nthe BasicSwap DEX.\n\nAs you probably realize by now, things are looking extremely positive for the\nParticl project, its future, and its vision of a decentralized and private\neconomy with no middleman (aka a real and global free market economy). The\nmainnet release of Particl V3 was a major milestone that needed to happen before\njumping right into the next big phase for the project. And now that the release\nis behind us, the real fun begins! \n\nThank you all for your support, passion, and for your valuable contributions.\nThis project would be nothing without all of you who have stuck around through\ntough times. You all have been our life force, and the future of Particl is now\nvery bright. We owe it to you all!\n\nHave a great weekend from the entire Particl team! \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This week has mainly been focused on prepping, building, testing, and\nuploading Particl V3 builds for mainnet release. Indeed, mainnet Particl V3\nbuilds have been circulated to a small network of sellers who've pledged to\npopulate the marketplace with listings prior to the release to ensure a smooth\nlaunch with various items to sell right from the very start. \n\nAdditionally, a lot of research and testing have gone into some of the new\nroadmap items that are coming shortly after the mainnet launch of Particl V3.\nInterestingly, a lot of these items are intrically related to the \"listing\nseeding proposal\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html]\", which\nhas been fully funded a few weeks ago, and are getting a slightly preferential\ntreatment as they allow the proposed system to be deployed faster. \n\nAs you know, we are awaiting Particl V3's mainnet release, which is now less\nthan a week away from now, to reveal the new roadmap. So make sure to keep your\neyes right on Particl News following the launch; things are only starting to get\ninteresting and the best is definitely yet to come!\n\nParticl V3's final testnet version; it's ready for mainnet!\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Development Report\nAside from the research and testing of new roadmap items, some efforts have gone\ninto improving the current version of Particl V3 along with some of its features\nand capabilities.\n\nCSV import Tool Improvements\nThere are some improvements already planned for the CSV import tool which lets\nyou import large numbers of listings at the same time. This includes the\npossibility to import images directly from the CSV, adding product codes, and\netc. We are working closely with some sellers to collect their feedback on this\nfunction as it is central to their operations.\n\nMarkdown Formatting to Listing Descriptions\nAdding markdown formatting to the listing descriptions allows sellers to better\npersonalize and market their products. Currently, listing descriptions only\nsupport plain text which is limiting.\n\nAdding Product Codes\nProducts currently don't have unique identifiers that would allow to rapidly\nreference and search for them. This is being worked and will help vendors to\nbetter promote and share their listings outside of the Particl Desktop client\n(i.e., in discussion forums like Reddit or social media platforms like Twitter).\n\nAllowing Digital Items\nAt this moment, Particl V3 only supports physical shipping addresses. This can\nget confusing when selling digital items that need to be delivered to an email\naddress, a cryptocurrency address (i.e., NFTs), accessed through an access code\n(i.e., a VPN account access code) or through a download link (i.e., digital\nbook). Changes are being prepared for later version of Particl V3 where it will\nbe possible to provide other delivery methods other than just a physical\naddress.\n\n> Note: The items mentioned above are relatively small compared to some of the new\nroadmap items that are soon to be revealed. We are focusing on these smaller\nitems as we await the release of Particl V3 on mainnet.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Core Development Report\nAs it often occurs, a new Particl Core (0.19.2.14\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.14]) version has\nbeen released this week which introduces minor improvements. As always, we\nhighly recommend keeping your client(s) and staking node(s) to the latest\nversion.

This would make\nboth of them much easier to use, more flexible, secure, private, and, perhaps\nmore importantly, set the stage for getting adoption from a broader range of\naudiences. This major and long-awaited upgrade is what is now known as “Particl\nV3”. \n\nWe are excited to announce, today, that Particl V3 is going live, on mainnet, on\nthe 29th of September 2021 at 12:00 UTC! \n\nThanks to all of you in the community for your support, time, passion,\nexperience, and dedication in helping out, testing, and engaging in constructive\nconversations that help shape the future of e-commerce and personal liberties.\nYou are what makes Particl's mission possible; our hats are off to you!\n\nNow let's go over a few basic information you need to know in preparation for\nthe mainnet release of Particl V3.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhere will it be available?\nParticl V3 refers to the new Particl Desktop (3.0.0) client which gives access\nto the new Particl Marketplace and community governance module. And so, to use\nthe marketplace, you will need to install the latest version of Particl Desktop,\nwhich will be available on the official Particl website\n[https://particl.io/downloads] and the project’s Github page\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/] on the 29th of September\n2021 at 12:00 UTC.\n\nWhat can I do to prepare?\nFinalize open orders on previous versions of the marketplace\nParticl V3 is the biggest update to Particl ever since the project was launched\nin 2017. And because the scope of the changes is so large, orders and listings\ncreated on previous versions won't be compatible with Particl V3.\n\nFor this reason, we highly recommend finalizing any open marketplace order on\nprevious versions. But don’t worry, if you have open orders that you cannot\ncomplete at this moment (i.e., the escrow smart-contract is still locked),\nyou’ll be able to switch between Particl Desktop 2.x.x and Particl 3.x.x freely,\nat any time, to finalize orders even if you’ve started using Particl V3.\n\nSpread the good word around you\nWith the long-anticipated Particl V3 release now having an official mainnet\nrelease date, now’s the time to inform people around you and talk about all the\nbenefits that private and unrestricted e-commerce without middlemen offers.\n\nTo support your communication efforts after the release, you'll be able to point\npotential newcomers to the Particl Academy.\n\nThe Particl Academy is Coming!\nTo support the mainnet release of Particl V3, the Particl Academy will launch on\nthe same day (29th of September 2021 at 12:00 UTC).\n\nThe Particl Academy is your guide to becoming an expert in distributed\ne-commerce with Particl Marketplace. It gives you all the information you need\nto master Particl V3 and the other components of the Particl ecosystem. It’s a\nthorough reference book written in simple and straightforward language that\nanybody can understand.\n\nIf you show Particl to someone new, don’t forget to point them to the Particl\nAcademy! That'll let them quickly learn about it and guide them through their\nfirst steps.\n\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nIf you haven’t already done so, we'd like to invite you to subscribe to our\nnewsletter so that you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive\ncontent. \n\nAlong with the Particl V3 mainnet release, we are re-initiating our newsletter\ncommunication. We will be pushing news, stories, and other valuable content\nthrough it from now on and subscribing is a perfect way not to miss anything\nimportant.\n\n * Subscribe to Particl's newsletter here: https://bit.ly/3CgyB3q\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSee You on Mainnet!\nParticl V3 is the new, more modern foundation on top of which the future of\nParticl is being built; it's just the beginning! \n\nWe also want to remind you to stay tuned as we will release a new,\ngroundbreaking roadmap shortly after the mainnet release of Particl V3. We are\nconvinced that you will be as excited as we are about the path forward. The next\nfew milestones are all about increasing Particl’s accessibility, usability,\nscalability, and, of course, adoption.\n\nOnce again, thank you for your incredible support and confidence throughout the\nentire development cycle of Particl V3. Positive words, constructive feedback,\nand discussions are critical to the success of the Particl ecosystem. We are\nblessed to have you as such a dedicated and passionate community and we're very\nexcited to walk through this journey with you all!\n\nLet’s now make sure to spread the word about the upcoming release to get as many\neyes as possible on it, and let’s blast through the next phase of the project.\nThe best is yet to come and it starts on the 29th of this month!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

We know how you are all very eager to hear about how it\nwent, and so, we can confirm that we have indeed some great news to report on\nthe subject. \n\nAs of today, we can confirm that a handful of small and minor issues have been\nfound and successfully resolved during the course of the week. This mainly\ninvolved chatting with various people, investigating where necessary, and then\ntweaking the code. With that in mind, we are happy to announce that no major\nissue, problem, or bug has been found that would block the mainnet release. For\nthis reason, the Particl V3 build is now officially ready for mainnet! ?\n\nThe launch date for Particl V3 will be announced today in a separate blog post\nthat's coming in the next few hours.

As nothing has\nbeen officially pushed in terms of code, we do not have much to report, but we\nare happy to mention that testing is going very well so far. We are more than\neager to reveal more information about the BasicSwap DEX and open up the beta\nphase of testing to the public shortly after the release of Particl V3 on\nmainnet.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCan you feel it? The long-awaited release of Particl V3 is finally at arm's\nreach and is just about to hit mainnet.

This week has\nbeen a happy one with the release of the new Particl V3 testnet builds. And so,\nmost of the work on the desktop side of things has been about dealing with\nquestions, assisting, and investigating (and fixing) more minor issues that have\nall come from the community.\n\nStatus of the Current Testnet Round\nWe're excited to announce that, as of yet, nothing significant has been reported\nin terms of blockers that may prevent a mainnet release. The only issue that may\nneed some attention is related to some performance-related concerns that have\nbeen reported on the private-by-default Whonix OS. However, we do not foresee\nany delay caused by this problem as it is relatively minor and straightforward\nto fix. \n\nAdditionally, we'd like to take at least one more week of testing before\ninitiating the process of releasing Particl V3 on mainnet. That's to allow more\ntime for edge-case testing and make sure no new bug is found in the coming days.\n\nAs such, assuming no new issue is found in the days to come, we will be ready to\nannounce Particl V3's mainnet release date next week!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Development Report\nAside from looking into smaller issues and inquiries regarding the current\nParticl V3 testnet round (that you can track here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues]), work has begun towards\nplanning out the next updates and additions for Particl Desktop moving forward\n(based on items from the new roadmap). So, if nothing new regarding the current\ntestnet requires attention, we'll start working next week on the changes planned\nfor the v3.1 release, but also possibly future v3.2 and v3.3 releases as well.\n\nOne useful addition to Particl V3 since the launch of the current testnet round\nis the ability to split UTXOs for public transactions as well (not just anon\ntransactions). The issue was reported by community member Kangoala; thanks for\npointing it out! You can read more about it here: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues/1813\n\nParticl Core Development Report\nOn the Particl Core side of things, we are happy to report that testing has\nresumed on BasicSwap with the closed beta group and that a few changes have been\nmade to the protocol. Much more details regarding BasicSwap coming right after\nthe release of Particl V3 on mainnet. \n\nWe're also excited to tease you by announcing that a new lightwallet client to\neasily store and use PART will join the Particl ecosystem very soon. Indeed, we\ncan report that, today, the first successful mainnet transaction using Particl\nElectrum has been made! \n\n * First Particl Electrum transaction on mainnet: \n   https://explorer.particl.io/tx/36949d5e5ea43b590cf4d20ac31662bc4890197fde77c0d185b46985ac5275e5\n\nParticl Electrum will play an important part for some of the things we have\nplanned ahead. Notably, the lightwallet provides \"light services\" that can be\nused to provide other Particl apps with an access to the blockchain without\nsyncing it entirely. It also provides for an easy way to use the Lightning\nNetwork through a built-in interface, although converting that code to Particl\nis still in progress. \n\nWe will provide more details about Particl Electrum and explain how it fits into\nthe broader Particl ecosystem as we move forward with our post-V3 strategic\nroadmap! \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you again for your support and passion for the project's mission. Exciting\ntimes are ahead, and while we encourage you to keep testing the current testnet\nversion of Particl V3, we certainly look forward to announcing the mainnet\nrelease date. \n\nWe'll be publishing more information next week regarding the mainnet launch of\nParticl V3 and will, at the same time, communicate a few things coming right\nafter or around this event.

The ability\n   to still continue with the publish is possible, but requires the seller to\n   explicitly indicate that this is acceptable.\n * Updated the csv product import functionality to attempt to match on country\n   name (English only for now) instead of just the ISO code.\n * The csv product import now allows for specifying the \"shipping to\"\n   destinations countries in a comma separated list.\n * The market summary text of a market shown in the Joined Markets section is\n   now selectable.\n * Includes changes made to particl-marketplace service such as...\n * Fixed an error that prevented a bid from being placed if all the images of\n   the item in question had not been properly received.\n * Fixed an error that caused the buyflow to become stuck due to the buyer\n   cancelling the purchase arrangement but the seller completing the escrow\n   state prior to receiving the cancellation action.\n * The particl-marketplace service now has some time on termination to attempt\n   to gracefully shut itself down, instead of terminating processing immediately\n   (and potentially causing issues with the processing of messages).\n * Remove the lookup for an existing \"market\" named wallet to create the initial\n   profile/identity wallets from when initializing the service for the first\n   time: this potentially causes errors and requires manual user intervention if\n   the named \"market\" wallet is encrypted and locked during the service\n   initialization.\n\nWallet Module\n * Updated the zap functionality (cold staking) to cater to additional user\n   options.\n * Changed wording on the transaction table entries to make more sense when fees\n   are involved: this includes fees paid for smsg fees (eg: publishing listings\n   via smsg) and zap transaction fees.\n * The restore wallet flow now caters to 12 word mnemonic inputs.\n\nGeneral\n * Added additional messages to message of the day.\n * Spelling and other grammar updates.\n * Update and unify usage of the zmq library dependency.\n * Application crashes should now be handled correctly: instead of receiving a\n   nasty JS error prompt, the error is logged and a friendlier window is\n   displayed indicating that the application has crashed.

This was the last remaining item\nbefore a new Particl V3 testnet build can be released, and we're happy to say\nthat it has been successfully completed!\n\nThat means we've initiated the process of building the new testnet version and\nwill be releasing it publicly in the next 72 hours.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Development Report\nBuild and Release the New Testnet Client\nAll that remains at this point is to build the new testnet version, test it\ninternally, and then release it for one more round of public testing. All the\nissues highlighted in the progress reports dating from the last testnet client\nup until now have been resolved. One more time, we're asking for your help in\ntesting the new client and trying to find any potential issue. \n\nMore specifically, here are our current areas of interest in regards to this\nspecific testnet round.\n\n 1. Test and verify that any previously mentioned issue is effectively resolved.\n 2. Test the disabling of cold staking from the module and determine whether a\n    previous issue is still present or not. In the previous codebase (\"Particl\n    V2\"), it used to cause problems in some rare cases, but we haven't been able\n    to reproduce it yet on our end. It may, or may not, still be present in\n    Particl V3.\n\nWe are targeting the next 72 hours for the release of the new testnet version of\nParticl V3. So stay tuned for when the news drop on Particl News and the other\nusual communication channels.\n\nParticl Core Development Report\nAside from the usual merging, core developer Tecnovert has resumed working on\nParticl's upcoming BasicSwap decentralized exchange protocol.\n\nAn update to the swapping protocol has gone live and is in the process of being\ntested by participants of the closed beta group.\n\nWhile we haven't made a ton of details on BasicSwap available yet, you can\nexpect that to change soon.\n\nWe'll be publishing more information on the application, how it works, how we\nplan to integrate it into the Particl ecosystem, and what's the longer-term\nvision we have planned for it shortly after the release of Particl V3 on\nmainnet. Additionally, you'll be able to test it out for yourself once we\ninitiate the open beta phase around the same time.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet's all test out the new testnet version of Particl V3 and ensure that it is\nfinally ready for mainnet. Once that is done, we'll be ready to blast forward\ninto the project's next phase and release our new and exciting roadmap.\n\nAs always, thank you immensely for your support and patience.

This week has been\none filled with progress, with solutions found and applied to all outstanding\nissues related to Particl V3. \n\nHowever, to ensure that the fixes work as intended, and before officially\nmarking them as fully resolved, we've decided to go ahead with one more round of\ncommunity testing that should begin within the next few days. That'll also allow\nthe team to monitor an interim solution that's been applied to the tricky ZMQ\nissue (more details further below).\n\nThis coming testnet round will be a public one, and we'll be putting extra focus\non testing the applied fixes with the specific people who've initially reported\nthem to ensure they're fixed on their environment. If no new problem arises,\nParticl V3 will then be ready for its mainnet release.\n\nLet's get down to the details of this week's report!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl V3 Development Update Report\nGracefully Shutting Down the Marketplace\nThe MP service needed a means of gracefully shutting down. Before, the process\nsimply terminated, which could lead to potential issues in some edge cases.\n\nA solution has been found and applied. We'll be waiting for the coming testnet\nround to confirm this issue as fully resolved.\n\nChanging the ZMQ Node Library\nThis specific issue has proven quite problematic, mainly due to the ZMQ library\nitself. Since we've started working on it, many back-and-forths using different\nlibrary versions have happened and they've all produced errors one way or the\nother. Unfortunately, no out-of-the-box and fit-all solution has been found.\nBut, regardless, we have some good news to report.\n\nIn the interest of moving forward, we have opted to apply an interim solution\nthat will allow Particl V3 to be released with a user-friendly and enjoyable\nexperience for all operating systems. The interim solution is as follows.\n\nOn one hand, Linux and Mac distributions will be using a version of ZMQ (version\n6) that works perfectly on these platforms. Users of these operating systems\nwon't experience any sort of issue or negative performance impact when using\nParticl V3. ZMQ 6.0 is the optimal solution for these two platforms.\n\nOn the other hand, Windows build will leverage a different version of ZMQ\n(version 5.2.6) which maximizes the performance within what's possible. While\nnot entirely perfect, it works fine and will allow Windows users to experience\nParticl V3 with as fewer performance issues as ZMQ on Windows permits. This,\ntoo, is the optimal solution for Windows given what's available. This is more or\nless outside of our control, and we plan on fixing that issue as we move forward\n(keep reading for more details about this).\n\nBecause ZMQ 5.2.6 causes issues on other OSes, we've opted to use different\nlibrary versions depending on the OS. That means the code between builds\nintended for Windows and those intended for Mac/Linux will be slightly\ndifferent, which is not ideal development-wise but allows us to release Particl\nV3. As a more elegant solution, we are considering forking the ZMQ library and\ntweaking it according to our specific needs. That would ultimately provide a\nsingle solution that works across the board, but it might lead to slightly more\nmaintenance requirements until a fix for Windows appears \"upstream\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_(software_development)]\". We will\ninvestigate this potential solution as we move forward.\n\nWe will be monitoring the results of the interim solution during the coming\ntestnet round and will report back if there's any change to this proposed\ntemporary solution. \n\n> Note: Not all Windows environments experience performance issues with ZMQ. Some\nWindows users will never experience any issue. For those users working within a\nWindows environment that causes performance issues with ZMQ, most of the\nproblems happen while the blockchain syncs. The issues tend to noticeably reduce\nin scope post-syncing.\nListing Template Hashes Not Properly Saved Under Specific Circumstances\nThere was an issue that could occur under a specific set of circumstances where\nthe posting of a template removed its hash, leading to problems with accepting\nbids.\n\nThis item is likely fixed now, but just like the previous two items, we want to\nwait for the results of the coming testnet round before officially marking this\none as fully resolved.\n\nParticl Core Development Update Report\nImproved Cold Staking Zap Feature Now Integrated Into Particl V3\nThe improved zap feature mentioned in last week's progress report has now been\nintegrated into the new Particl V3 build and will be available for testing\nduring the coming testnet round. \n\nWe highly encourage you to test it out and, as always, do your best to try to\nbreak it! \n\nParticl Core Merging\nAs usual, Particl Core has received many merges and updates to keep its code\nup-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. This is an ever-ongoing task that\nneeds to receive constant attention.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs we near the mainnet release of Particl V3, we encourage you to test the\nupcoming testnet build and see if you can find any issue with it. \n\nFinding bugs, unexpected behaviors, and areas of improvements during testnet\nhelps straighten up Particl V3 for its mainnet release and vastly improves the\nfirst impression new users get when they first get their hands on it. While bug\ndiscovery may delay mainnet releases, they are vital in keeping Particl secure\nand appealing.\n\nAs always, we thank you all for your support and dedication. You are what makes\nParticl possible, and the entire Particl team is incredibly grateful!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

In fact, Particl Core has, as of today, caught up to\nBitcoin's 0.22 code. That's a great news as it means that any delay in keeping\nup with Bitcoin's code caused by the unfortunate events earlier this year has\nnow been resolved.\n\nWhile not yet available for release (Particl always waits for Bitcoin to push\nits new versions first), you can track any 0.22 related development at the\nfollowing link: https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/tree/22.x.\n\nYou can also see what's new with Bitcoin 0.22 by following this link: \nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/22.0-Release-Notes-draft \n\nImport Particl Wallets From Mnemonic With the Right Cold Staking Change Address\nExtkey\nA new commit\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commit/8665ee5e5d6ddb5deb09809b3c4f9a6ea12b15a9] \nhas been submitted to the Particl Core repository and is tagged for the\n0.19.2.14 Particl Core release. It adds the ability for wallets to receive from\nnon-account linked extkey chains. It can be used when restoring a coldstaking\nwallet from a mnemonic and re-adding the same coldstaking-changeaddress extkey. \n\nUsually, as the added extkey is external to the wallet, its spends would not be\ndetected. This means the restored wallet would reuse keys from the start of that\nchain for any newly created transactions.

(0.19.2.13)\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.13] has been\nreleased today. It introduces a significant update to the cold staking \"zap\"\nscript, hardware wallet support for Trezor devices, as well as a good variety of\nimprovements and minor fixes.\n\n * Download link: \n   https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.13\n\nRelease Particl Core 0.19.2.13 · particl/particl-coreRelease\nNotes:https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019213Hashes1d43c6f75af5daefdde50376f2cbe4e38a4683e288bbe37c9fadf9aff76ff282\nparticl-0.19.2.13-aarch...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.13]As always, we\nhighly recommend keeping your node(s) and wallet(s) up-to-date with Particl's\nlatest version. If you're using the cold staking application Partyman, you can\nupdate by entering the partyman/partyman update command from your home folder or \n./partyman update from inside your partyman folder.\n\nYou can verify the full list of additions by checking out the release notes\nhere: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019213\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCold Staking \"Zap\" Feature Update\nThe zap feature lets you delegate the entirety of your staking outputs to an\nexternal cold staking node. While it has been available for several years, this\nParticl Core update improves its behavior and adds to it a new, very useful\nfeature.\n\nIndeed, it is now possible to choose whether you want your zap to be more\nprivate (doesn't use and mix inputs from different addresses in a single zapping\ntransaction) or instantly get optimal staking performances (default behavior). \n\nIt is currently possible to use the improved zap feature on Particl Core\n(although not directly supported in Particl Qt's wallet interface), but it will\nonly be available on Particl Desktop on the mainnet release of Particl V3.\nPrevious versions of Particl Desktop still work using the older version of the\nzap feature.\n\nIf you want to use the zap script without Particl Desktop, you can use this\nscript that is available on Github: \nhttps://github.com/tecnovert/particl_scripts/blob/main/zap.py.\n\nHardware Support for Trezor Devices \nThis Particl Core update also adds support for Trezor devices. Please note that\nour integration is not yet officially supported by Trezor itself, but the new\ncore update provides the code required for it.\n\nThe implementation supports incoming blind (CT) and anon (RingCT) transactions,\nmeaning you'll be able to privately send your funds to your device using\nhardware hardening, but without compromising your privacy while doing so. \n\nNote that, although it supports incoming privacy transactions (from an anon or\nblind balance to a public balance), the Trezor implementation will itself only\nsupport public balances, at least for the initial implementation.\n\nWe will communicate more details about official support from Trezor as soon as\nwe can!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Core 0.22 Coming Soon!\nParticl's core developer Tecnovert has been catching up with Bitcoin's codebase\nat lightning-fast pace. In fact, Particl Core has, as of today, caught up to\nBitcoin's 0.22 code. That's a great news as it means that any delay in keeping\nup with Bitcoin's code caused by the unfortunate events earlier this year has\nnow been resolved.\n\nGitHub - tecnovert/particl-core at 22.xParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/tree/22.x]As\nis tradition, and because of security, we will be waiting for the Bitcoin\ndevelopers to officially push their own 0.22 version to mainnet before doing the\nsame with Particl.\n\nFor a list of what Bitcoin's 0.22 release contains, please follow this link: \nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/22.0-Release-Notes-draft\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This week, the focus has yet\nagain been on fixing the remaining issues that were identified in the last\nParticl V3 testnet round.\n\nAs was identified in last week’s report, the team has separated the reported\nissues into two categories; minor issues and more serious ones. We can happily\nreport that all minor issues have been resolved and are either waiting for the\ncode that introduces the fixes to be merged.\n\nThe main priority now lies in fixing the “more serious” issues previously\nidentified. Here’s a status update on each of them.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGracefully Shutting Down the Marketplace\nThe MP service needs a means of gracefully shutting down. Currently, the process\nsimply terminates, which can lead to potential issues in some edge cases.\n\nThere has been a lot of back and forth and iterations for the fix over this\nparticular issue, and a solution has been found. The team is now busy testing\nthe fix properly and tweaking it, as required.\n\nChanging the ZMQ Node Library\nThe ZMQ node library currently being used causes performance issues for some\nusers and specific OSes. Finding a valid fix or alternative library is still an\noutstanding task, but when resolved, it will have the added benefit of making\nParticl Desktop usable on the privacy-centric OS Whonix. This will allow Particl\nV3 to work within a Tor-only environment for maximal privacy.\n\nThis is the next item in line after fixing the “gracefully shutting down the\nmarketplace” item.\n\nListing Template Hashes Not Properly Saved Under Specific Circumstances\nThere's an issue that can occur under a specific set of circumstances where the\nposting of a template removes the template hash, leading to problems with\naccepting bids.\n\nThis is the last item in line and should, unless new issues are identified, be\nthe last one out of the list identified during the last testnet round.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIs Another Testnet Round Coming Up?\nDue to the sizable number of issues identified during the last testnet round,\nthe team may issue a new build for one more testing round. This hasn’t been\ndecided yet but is likely.\n\nHowever, how this testnet round would happen is still up for debate. A\nsmaller-in-scope round may be initiated where certain users (those who’ve\nencountered specific issues) receive a build to swiftly verify that the fixes\naddress the highlighted issues without any new issue. Of course, we’ll\ncommunicate the information about this as soon as it’s available!\n\nA Development Update on Non-V3 Related Items\nThe Particl team has also been busy working on other non-V3 items. A new Particl\nCore version will soon be released with a few minor improvements, including a\nsignificant improvement in how the cold staking zap system behaves.\n\nAdditionally, the majority of the work required to make Particl smoothly\ncompatible with the Trezor hardware wallet has been completed. A lot of testing\nand merges on Trezor’s end are still required. Note that the current Trezor\nimplementation supports public transactions, but also blind (CT) and anon\n(RingCT) ones. That’ll mean that it’ll be possible to privately store your PART\non Trezor as soon as the full release is live.\n\nFinally, a lot of focus has also been placed on doing research on new roadmap\nitems and exploring their feasibility. We are finalizing the post-v3 roadmap and\nwill be publishing it after Particl V3 releases on mainnet. It includes a lot of\nexciting items which will go a long way in making Particl much more accessible\nand easy to use. We’re confident that you will be as excited as we are with the\npath we’re taking forward and with the short, mid, and long-term vision for both\nParticl Marketplace and other components of the ecosystem.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe’d like to once again thank everyone who's taken the time to properly test\nthis last testnet. Although a good number of issues have been identified, their\nassociated fixes will ensure a V3 mainnet launch that is smooth and without any\nbad bump.\n\nWe wish you all a wonderful weekend!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

While these are mostly minor\nissues, they are required to be fixed before the launch. \n\nWith all of the above said, let's get down to the progress report.\n\n> Note: Some items that were present in the last progress report are not included\nin this one. In all cases, that’s because they have been successfully completed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn Progress\n * Looking into the zmq node library that we're making use of.

and deliverables that are\nplanned to be part of it. This includes, but isn’t limited to, the initial\nplanning of an SMSG Manager to provide the basis for a unified SMSG processing\nsection for various app/modules (and prepare for the upcoming migration to SMSG\n2.0 later on), a further separation of Particl Desktop and Particl Core, and\nvarious other items.\n\nTo be noted, you can expect the next couple of weeks to be more heavily\nresearch-focused than usual. That’s because the upcoming mainnet release crosses\na lot of items from the current roadmap. As Particl jumps into the next phase of\nits development cycle, a lot of the new, more sizeable roadmap items require\nproper research into their feasibility, security, privacy, decentralization, and\nother various implications.\n\nWith all of the above said, let's get down to the progress report.\n\n> Note: Some items that were present in the last progress report are not included\nin this one. In all cases, that’s because they have been successfully completed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn Progress\nAny New Particl V3 Bug\nAny reported bug from the new Particl V3 testnet build will get immediate\npriority to ensure the client is stable and ready for mainnet release as fast as\npossible.\n\nIf you encounter any issue while testing Particl V3, please report it to the\nGithub Issue page of the particl-desktop repository. This page is located here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues].\n\nResearch and Experimentation Related to Potential Post-V3 Roadmap Items\nVarious research and experimentation related to post-V3 roadmap items have\nbegun. This is expected to last for a few weeks as the team is finalizing its\npost-V3 roadmap, establishing priorities, and so on. We will publicly release\nthe roadmap and the team's vision, goals, and objectives for the foreseeable\nfuture very soon.\n\nStay tune as we’ll push everything, as per usual, through Particl News and our\ntypical communications channels.\n\nTo Be Completed Next\nMainnet Release of Particl V3\nParticl V3 is currently going through what is expected to be its final testnet\nround. A few minor issues have been picked up so far by the community, but it\nstill doesn’t appear, at this time, like a new testnet round will be required.\nThank you all for your precious help!\n\nStill, we want to reiterate our call for help to all Windows 10 users who\ncouldn’t run previous Particl V3 testnet builds. While the issue appears to have\nbeen fixed, we’d like to gather as much feedback as possible from you to ensure\nthat the build works fine over as many different environments as possible.\n\nAs we are lining everything up for Particl V3 to go live on mainnet, we will\nvery soon announce its exact release date. Keep an eye on Particl News\n[https://particl.news/] and other communications channel; the date will be\nclearly announced in advance so that everybody has the time to prepare and\nspread the word.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCan you feel it? After months of hard work, Particl V3 is finally ready to be\nunleashed to the world. And it can’t come at a better time; the world\nincreasingly realizes that it needs it, and that feeling will only get stronger\nas time passes by.\n\nAs a final word for this update, we’d like to mention that if you plan on\nselling stuff on Particl Marketplace, then we encourage you to download the CSV\nInventory File template using the current testnet build by navigating to the\nSELL / Inventory & Products / Import / CSV File section of Particl Desktop.\nThat’ll allow you to prepare your listings before the mainnet release so that\nyou can get down to business in lightning-fast fashion.\n\nThanks for the tremendous support throughout the entire development cycle of\nParticl V3. It can be hard, at times, to quantify the impact of supporting\nwords, but it’s been of great help to all team members and makes all the blood,\nsweat, and tears that was put into it worth more than anything in the world.\nLet’s change the world for the better, together!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This list is not exhaustive, it does not\ninclude some of the smaller and/or less impactful fixes.\n\n[Governance module] Introduces a new governance module that allows for viewing\nactive and upcoming CCS proposals that require a network vote, as well as past\nproposals. Voting on a current or future proposal is currently available,\nalthough not enabled when using a cold staking wallet (the vote should rather be\ncast on the cold staking node). Further, detailed information on the proposals\nand how to vote is included in the module. While the governance module is\nincluded in this release, it has been temporarily disabled - this is not a bug\n\n[Market module] Removes the unused and invalid publishing controls in the\nproduct import wizard.\n\n[Market module] Images are displayed alongside the market name, if available, in\nadditional places in the product creation and publishing areas.\n\n[Market module] Removes the display of a 'ROOT' parent category that was\ndisplayed on items in the cart.\n\n[Market module] Replaces usage of the word 'bid' with 'order request' and\n'order' where appropriate, to avoid confusion ('bid' terminology is confusing,\nwith 'order request' more accurately aligning with the behaviour).\n\n[Market module] Fixes an error in the GUI preventing the joining of a market\nunder certain circumstances.\n\n[Market module] When a listing item is flagged, all exact duplicates of the\nlisting item in the same market are now flagged as well. When a new duplicate of\nan already flagged item is received for the same market, it will be flagged as\nwell.\n\n[Market module] Fixes a case in the Listing Details where action buttons were\nnot disabling correctly when another action is being processed and taking some\ntime to complete.\n\n[Market module] Adds the ability to export to CSV a list of sell orders. The\nsell orders exported are those currently displayed; sell orders exported are\ninfluenced by any search and filtering criteria applied).\n\n[Market module] Fixes an issue preventing publishing items to a market with a 0\nvalue for either of the shipping prices.\n\n[Market module] Fixes an error whereby the wrong favorite item may be removed\nwhile attempting to remove a favorite item.\n\n[Market module] Reduces the number of stealth addresses used per wallet/identity\nthroughout the marketplace.\n\n[Market module] Adds additional validation to market message order sequencing.\n\n[Wallet module] Prevents the user from navigating to another app/module in\ncertain steps of the wallet creation: this prevents issues with potentially\nusing an uninitialized wallet in other app/module (i.e., the Governance module).\n\n[General] Fixes the zmq.node error on some versions of Windows that prevented\nthe application from opening.\n\n[General] Attempts a fix at a possible intermittent issue where the connection\nevent may not be properly processed and thus the application fails to start\ncorrectly. Further testing and feedback may be necessary.\n\n[General] Display a random \"message of the day\" on the welcome screen. The\ncurrent number of messages is limited, but can be added to in the future.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf this testing round goes well and no other major issue is identified in the\nnext couple of days, Particl V3 will be ready for mainnet very shortly. We will\nclearly communicate the mainnet release date on Particl News\n[https://particl.news/] and within the usual communications channels.\n\nSo let's get testing and keep an eye out for the confirmation on the release\ndate very soon!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This list is not exhaustive, it does not include some of the smaller and/or less impactful fixes.</p><p><strong>[Governance module]</strong> Introduces a new governance module that allows for viewing active and upcoming CCS proposals that require a network vote, as well as past proposals. Voting on a current or future proposal is currently available, although not enabled when using a cold staking wallet (the vote should rather be cast on the cold staking node). Further, detailed information on the proposals and how to vote is included in the module. <strong>While the governance module is included in this release, it has been temporarily disabled - this is not a bug</strong></p><p><strong>[Market module]</strong> Removes the unused and invalid publishing controls in the product import wizard.</p><p><strong>[Market module]</strong> Images are displayed alongside the market name, if available, in additional places in the product creation and publishing areas.</p><p><strong>[Market module]</strong> Removes the display of a 'ROOT' parent category that was displayed on items in the cart.</p><p><strong>[Market module]</strong> Replaces usage of the word 'bid' with 'order request' and 'order' where appropriate, to avoid confusion ('bid' terminology is confusing, with 'order request' more accurately aligning with the behaviour).</p><p><strong>[Market module]</strong> Fixes an error in the GUI preventing the joining of a market under certain circumstances.</p><p><strong>[Market module]</strong> When a listing item is flagged, all exact duplicates of the listing item in the same market are now flagged as well. When a new duplicate of an already flagged item is received for the same market, it will be flagged as well.</p><p><strong>[Market module]</strong> Fixes a case in the Listing Details where action buttons were not disabling correctly when another action is being processed and taking some time to complete.</p><p><strong>[Market module]</strong> Adds the ability to export to CSV a list of sell orders. The sell orders exported are those currently displayed; sell orders exported are influenced by any search and filtering criteria applied).</p><p><strong>[Market module]</strong> Fixes an issue preventing publishing items to a market with a 0 value for either of the shipping prices.</p><p><strong>[Market module]</strong> Fixes an error whereby the wrong favorite item may be removed while attempting to remove a favorite item.</p><p><strong>[Market module]</strong> Reduces the number of stealth addresses used per wallet/identity throughout the marketplace.</p><p><strong>[Market module]</strong> Adds additional validation to market message order sequencing.</p><p><strong>[Wallet module]</strong> Prevents the user from navigating to another app/module in certain steps of the wallet creation: this prevents issues with potentially using an uninitialized wallet in other app/module (i.e., the Governance module).</p><p><strong>[General]</strong> Fixes the zmq.node error on some versions of Windows that prevented the application from opening.</p><p><strong>[General]</strong> Attempts a fix at a possible intermittent issue where the connection event may not be properly processed and thus the application fails to start correctly. Further testing and feedback may be necessary.</p><p><strong>[General]</strong> Display a random \"message of the day\" on the welcome screen. The current number of messages is limited, but can be added to in the future.</p><hr><p>If this testing round goes well and no other major issue is identified in the next couple of days, Particl V3 will be ready for mainnet very shortly. We will clearly communicate the mainnet release date on <a href=\"https://particl.news/\">Particl News</a> and within the usual communications channels.</p><p>So let's get testing and keep an eye out for the confirmation on the release date very soon!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

This is a very important milestone for Particl as the\nhardfork introduces various changes and re-enables the ability to conduct blind\nand anon transactions.\n\nThis blog post will summarize everything brought by the hardfork and provide an\nupdate on the claims submitted by users who had coins temporarily disabled.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Has Hardforked\nToday, on Monday the 12th of July, 2021, at 17:00 UTC, the Particl blockchain\nhas successfully hardforked. This event officially turns the page on the\nunfortunate exploit on the chain that led to the creation of fraudulent coins\nout of thin air.\n\nFor an overview of the exploit and its disclosure, please head over to this\nParticl News blog post [https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/].\nFor a summary of the solutions that have been deployed, please check out this\none [https://particl.news/roadmap-to-post-inflation-hardfork/].\n\n> Note: If your Particl Core node is not updated to Particl Core 0.19.2.12, then\nit means you are now staking on the wrong chain. Any staking reward earned on\nthe wrong chain won't count on the correct chain, and you won't be able to send\nor receive payments from other people. Updating to Particl Core 0.19.2.12 is\nmandatory.\nBlind and Anon Transactions Re-Enabled\nOne of the two main components of this hardfork is the re-enabling of blind and\nanon transactions. In addition, the hardfork also re-enables the majority of\nanon and blind balances that were temporarily disabled to stop the attacker from\ncausing further damage on the blockchain.\n\nIn other words, you can now freely make blind and anon transactions once again\nand use Particl Marketplace on Particl Desktop V2. The hardfork also enables\nParticl V3 to go live on mainnnet as it relies on blind and anon transactions.\nMore details on this very soon!\n\nRe-Enable Coins Using the Low Pass Filter\nIf you had coins on blind and/or anon balances when the vulnerability was\nannounced and fixed, then they have been temporarily disabled up until today. To\nre-enable them, the Particl team deployed a “low pass filter” which\nautomatically re-enables any output with 200 or fewer coins.\n\nTo re-enable temporarily disabled coins using the low pass filter, you will need\nto enter the following command, once for every disabled output, in your Particl\nclient’s debug window.\n\ndebugwallet {\\\"spend_frozen_output\\\":true}\n\nFor example, if you have 220 disabled coins separated into two 110 PART outputs,\nyou will need to enter the above command twice in a row. You need to use Particl\nCore 0.19.2.12 to successfully re-enable your coins.\n\nRe-Enable Coins Using the Manual Claim Process\nIf you have disabled blind and anon outputs that contain more than 200 coins,\nyou were required to manually submit a claim to the team to include it in the\nwhitelist. If that’s your case, and you’ve submitted a claim, then your outputs\nhave been whitelisted, and you can now spend them. To do just that, you will\nneed to follow the same step as with the low pass filter.\n\nFor every disabled output you have, you need to type in the following command.\n\ndebugwallet {\\\"spend_frozen_output\\\":true}\n\nFor example, if you have 1,000 coins that are currently disabled, spread into 4\noutputs of 250 PART each, you will need to type the above command 4 times. You\nneed to use Particl Core 0.19.2.12 to successfully re-enable your coins.\n\nManual Claim Process Update\nTo be as transparent as possible, we’d like to provide a full update on the\nmanual claim process and its impact on Particl’s circulating supply.\n\nThroughout the entire span of the claim process, a total of 12 claims have been\nsubmitted to the team. Each claim has been thoroughly inspected and audited. We\nare happy to say that all submitted claims appear legitimate and that none of\nthem traced back to fraudulent or suspicious outputs. The submitted claims\neither traced back to their public origin, were accompanied by a proof of\npurchase, or had the typical cryptography one would expect from legitimate\noutputs.\n\nFor this reason, all claims been approved by both the team and the community\ngroup of validators. This claim process results in an additional\n810,588.43967605 PART being added to the supply, bringing it to a current total\nof ~11,411,000 PART. This doesn’t take any coin re-enabled through the low pass\nfilter into account.\n\n> Note: Particl’s block explorer [https://explorer.particl.io/status] currently\ndisplays a smaller circulating supply value than what is stated above. That’s\nbecause it doesn’t see disabled coins from users who haven’t yet executed the\ncommand to re-enable them. Every time users manually re-enable their coins, the\nblock explorer will dynamically adjust its circulating supply value.\nNew Treasury Model is Live\nThe second principal component of this hardfork is the activation of Particl’s\nnew and decentralized treasury model, which provides the ecosystem with\nperpetual PART revenue. Check out this blog post\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/] for more details.\n\nDecentralized Treasury Model ProposalLearn more about the new CCS proposal to\nform a new decentralized treasury model to support the Particl ecosystem.Blog\ncryptoguard [https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/]As a\nresult of this successful hardfork, anyone can now submit funding requests on\nParticl’s CCS platform to fund and support initiatives that directly benefit the\necosystem. Any funding request has to be approved by Particl stakeholders\nthrough an on-chain vote for the funds to be allocated from the treasury.\n\nIf you want to submit a proposal, please head over to the CCS platform\n[https://ccs.particl.io/] and read the instructions provided on there.\n\nIncrease in Staking Rewards\nAs part of the new treasury model, staking rewards are also getting a bump.\nIndeed, as of today, Particl’s emission rate has increased from 2% per year to\n8%, with half of the rewards going directly into the Treasury Fund.\n\nThat means that, as an individual staker, your staking rewards double from 2%\nper year to a minimum of 4%. But, of course, the actual yield rewarded to you\nfrom staking PART varies depending on how many more PART coins are being staked\nby other people. If, for example, only 50% of all PART coins stake on the\nnetwork, then you can expect your annual returns to be closer to 8% than 4%. You\ncan use CryptoID’s useful extraction tool\n[https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/#!extraction] to track the percentage of all\nPART coins being staked by their owner.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Particl team would like to thank you all for your incredible support and\nunderstanding through this challenging series of events. As we officially turn\nthe page on the vulnerability exploit with the hardfork, the team is excited to\nmove forward once again and spend its time growing and promoting the Particl\necosystem.\n\nStay tuned as we near the mainnet release of Particl V3 and soon release a bunch\nof exciting news, including the new roadmap, on Particl News.\n\nWhat doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, and that’s precisely the case here.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

For a summary of the solutions that have been deployed, please check out <a href=\"https://particl.news/roadmap-to-post-inflation-hardfork/\"><strong>this one</strong></a>.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> If your Particl Core node is not updated to Particl Core 0.19.2.12, then it means you are now staking on the wrong chain. Any staking reward earned on the wrong chain won't count on the correct chain, and you won't be able to send or receive payments from other people. <strong>Updating to Particl Core 0.19.2.12 is mandatory.</strong></em></blockquote><h1 id=\"blind-and-anon-transactions-re-enabled\">Blind and Anon Transactions Re-Enabled</h1><p>One of the two main components of this hardfork is the re-enabling of blind and anon transactions. In addition, the hardfork also re-enables the majority of anon and blind balances that were temporarily disabled to stop the attacker from causing further damage on the blockchain.</p><p>In other words, you can now freely make blind and anon transactions once again and use Particl Marketplace on Particl Desktop V2. The hardfork also enables Particl V3 to go live on mainnnet as it relies on blind and anon transactions. More details on this very soon!</p><h2 id=\"re-enable-coins-using-the-low-pass-filter\">Re-Enable Coins Using the Low Pass Filter</h2><p>If you had coins on blind and/or anon balances when the vulnerability was announced and fixed, then they have been temporarily disabled up until today. To re-enable them, the Particl team deployed a “low pass filter” which automatically re-enables any output with 200 or fewer coins.</p><p>To re-enable temporarily disabled coins using the low pass filter, you will need to enter the following command, once for every disabled output, in your Particl client’s debug window.</p><p><code class=\"language-text\">debugwallet {\\\"spend_frozen_output\\\":true}</code></p><p>For example, if you have 220 disabled coins separated into two 110 PART outputs, you will need to enter the above command twice in a row. <strong>You need to use Particl Core 0.19.2.12 to successfully re-enable your coins.</strong></p><h2 id=\"re-enable-coins-using-the-manual-claim-process\">Re-Enable Coins Using the Manual Claim Process</h2><p>If you have disabled blind and anon outputs that contain more than 200 coins, you were required to manually submit a claim to the team to include it in the whitelist. If that’s your case, and you’ve submitted a claim, then your outputs have been whitelisted, and you can now spend them. To do just that, you will need to follow the same step as with the low pass filter.</p><p>For every disabled output you have, you need to type in the following command.</p><p><code class=\"language-text\">debugwallet {\\\"spend_frozen_output\\\":true}</code></p><p>For example, if you have 1,000 coins that are currently disabled, spread into 4 outputs of 250 PART each, you will need to type the above command 4 times. <strong>You need to use Particl Core 0.19.2.12 to successfully re-enable your coins.</strong></p><h2 id=\"manual-claim-process-update\">Manual Claim Process Update</h2><p>To be as transparent as possible, we’d like to provide a full update on the manual claim process and its impact on Particl’s circulating supply.</p><p>Throughout the entire span of the claim process, <strong>a total of 12 claims have been submitted</strong> to the team. Each claim has been thoroughly inspected and audited. We are happy to say that all submitted claims appear legitimate and that none of them traced back to fraudulent or suspicious outputs. The submitted claims either traced back to their public origin, were accompanied by a proof of purchase, or had the typical cryptography one would expect from legitimate outputs.</p><p>For this reason, all claims been approved by both the team and the community group of validators. This claim process results in an <strong>additional 810,588.43967605 PART</strong> being added to the supply, bringing it to a current total of <strong>~11,411,000 PART</strong>. This doesn’t take any coin re-enabled through the low pass filter into account.</p><blockquote><em>Note: <a href=\"https://explorer.particl.io/status\">Particl’s block explorer</a> currently displays a smaller circulating supply value than what is stated above. That’s because it doesn’t see disabled coins from users who haven’t yet executed the command to re-enable them. Every time users manually re-enable their coins, the block explorer will dynamically adjust its circulating supply value.</em></blockquote><h1 id=\"new-treasury-model-is-live\">New Treasury Model is Live</h1><p>The second principal component of this hardfork is the activation of Particl’s new and decentralized treasury model, which provides the ecosystem with perpetual PART revenue.

But, of course, the actual yield rewarded to you from staking PART varies depending on how many more PART coins are being staked by other people.

You can use <a href=\"https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/#!extraction\"><strong>CryptoID’s useful extraction tool</strong></a> to track the percentage of all PART coins being staked by their owner.</p><hr><p>The Particl team would like to thank you all for your incredible support and understanding through this challenging series of events.
