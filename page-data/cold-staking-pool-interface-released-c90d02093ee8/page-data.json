All rewards\nearned while staking from a pool are sent over to the pool operator, which then\nexecutes payouts proportional to how much you’ve contributed to the total amount\nof rewards the pool earned. This is particularly useful if you own fewer coins\nand still want to stake your coins as it means you’ll earn more frequent, but\nsmaller, staking rewards.\n\nCold Staking Pools\ntecnovert/particl-coldstakepool\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool]\nPooled coldstaking demo. Contribute to tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool\ndevelopment by creating an account on GitHub.\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool]github.com\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool]\n\nThe reason Particl’s staking pools are called cold staking pools is that they\noperate in the same way cold staking does. Cold staking allows you to delegate\nyour staking powers to a cold staking node which can then stake on your behalf,\nbut without being able to spend your coins. In other words, cold staking allows\nyou to stake coins stored offline without giving the node operator access to\nyour coins (usually, the operator is the same user as the coins being staked,\nalthough not obligatory).\n\nIn that sense, cold staking pools are like special cold staking nodes that\nallows the pool operator to spend staking rewards on your behalf, but not your\ncoins. This distinction between staking pools and cold staking pools is\nimportant because the latter is much more secure. Because the pool doesn’t\nactually hold any coin other than a few hours worth of staking rewards, there is\nactually very little to steal for a hacker as the entirety of the staking weight\npossessed by the cold staking pool isn’t even in their possession. Cold staking\npools keep you in full control of your own funds at all time!\n\nNote: You can get the full benefits of the world’s most secure Proof-of-Stake\nprotocol by combining cold staking or cold staking pools to the security of a\nLedger Nano S hardware device. This will make your funds impossible to steal\neven when unlocking your wallet from an infected or compromised computer. To\nlearn more about this, read the “The Ultimate Vulnerability” section of this\nblog post\n[https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae]. To\nlearn how to connect your funds stored on a Ledger Nano S hardware device to a\nstaking pool, follow the instructions in this tutorial\n[https://particl.news/particl-ledger-video-tutorial-setup-cold-staking-2cd5628fecac] \nand, instead of using a cold staking node public key, use the public key given\nto you by the cold staking pool.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow Are Cold Staking Pools Going to Benefit the Particl Network?\nIn short, it’s going to make staking much more accessible and practical to\neveryone, regardless of the number of coins you hold or your level of expertise.\n\nStaking With Fewer Coins\nIn fact, staking with only a small PART balance is not ideal because of the size\nof each staking reward (~1.25 PART at the time of this writing). To put that in\nperspective, consider the moment 1 PART was worth around $50. If you wanted to\nbuy $1,000 worth of Particl, that would have given you around 20 PART. Back\nthen, the staking interest rate was 5%. This meant that, after one full year of\nstaking, you would have earned around 1 PART staking on the network, a yearly\nreward that is smaller than the payout size. In other words, chances are high\nthat you wouldn’t even have received a single reward during the entire year even\nthough you helped secure the network the whole time. This phenomenon is not\nunlike “solo mining” with a poor GPU on Proof-of-Work networks.\n\nNow, with cold staking pools, you could “team up” with the other stakers\nconnected to the same pool as you and get a share of the staking rewards earned\nby the pool proportional to how much you’ve contributed to it. Instead of\nwaiting a long time to receive one large staking reward, you would receive\nsmaller but more frequent rewards. This makes staking much more interesting and\ninteractive, and also makes staking with fewer coins more stable and reliable.\n\nEasier to Set Up for Non-Technical Users\nAnother obstacle to cold staking is the technical level required to set up a\ncold staking node. Although not overly complicated, especially when following \nthe cold staking node setup tutorial\n[https://particl.news/guide-setting-up-particl-cold-staking-f5d9073bac4], it\ndoes require time and effort to correctly execute. It also generally requires\nthe use of a staking device like a Raspberry Pi or a VPS server, all of which\nadds up to the difficulty and hassle of setting cold staking up.\n\nOn top of that, staking devices need to be maintained quite regularly: you need\nto make sure it is up 24/7, you need to ideally keep it updated to the latest\nParticl Core version (especially when there are hardforks), and you need to make\nsure it is properly restarted when, for example, there is a power outage or\nsomething that makes the electricity go off.\n\nFor a lot of users, especially the less technical ones, the dedication it takes\nto set cold staking up and maintain its device is simply too much. Cold staking\npools, on the other hand, do not require you to prepare and manage a staking\nnode since that part is taken care of by the pool operator. Enabling cold\nstaking has never been as easy as with cold staking pools, and it shouldn’t take\nmore than 2 minutes off of your time!\n\nMore Coins Being Staked\nBecause of how much it would benefit some types of users, cold staking pools are\nlikely to encourage more people to stake their coins. This will benefit the\nnetwork by having fewer available coins on the markets, meaning it would be much\nharder for an attacker to acquire large sums of PART coins and try to damage the\nnetwork with a 51% attack. In Proof-of-Stake networks, more coins being put up\nfor staking means it is more secure.\n\nNote: Staking pools do present a risk to the network if misused. In fact, while\nthey make 51% attacks harder to execute by reducing the number of coins\navailable on the markets, they could also potentially end up staking 51% of the\ntotal network supply if users are not careful enough. As such, we encourage as\nmany people within the community to come up with their own cold staking pools\n(the source code is openly available here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool]) in order to create many\ndifferent options for users which would lead to a better decentralization of the\nstaking supply.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQuick Facts\n * You can still vote on Community Proposals and flag listings while your funds\n   are connected to a cold staking pool.\n * The pool operator cannot vote on your behalf, nor can he flag listings using\n   your coin weight.\n * Records can be obtained to verify the pool’s operator integrity.\n * Payout threshold (the total amount of PART you need to accumulate within the\n   pool before a payout is executed) is set up by the pool operator and can be\n   changed at any time.\n * In the future, pools might be able to read specially formatted control\n   transactions, meaning smart-contracts could potentially interact with them.\n * In the future, research might be done to integrate the Lightning Network to\n   cold staking pools, which would allow an almost infinite number of\n   micro-payouts per day (i.e. multiple payouts throughout the day of 0.01\n   PART). This may or may not happen depending on the need and feasibility of\n   such a feature.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started Today!\nConnect to a staking pool today and start reaping its benefits in less than 2\nminutes!

All rewards earned while staking from a pool are sent over to the pool operator, which then executes payouts proportional to how much you’ve contributed to the total amount of rewards the pool earned. This is particularly useful if you own fewer coins and still want to stake your coins as it means you’ll earn more frequent, but smaller, staking rewards.</p><h3 id=\"cold-staking-pools\">Cold Staking Pools</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool\"><strong>tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool\"><em>Pooled coldstaking demo. Contribute to tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool development by creating an account on GitHub.</em></a><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool\">github.com</a></p><p>The reason Particl’s staking pools are called cold staking pools is that they operate in the same way cold staking does. Cold staking allows you to delegate your staking powers to a cold staking node which can then stake on your behalf, but without being able to spend your coins. In other words, cold staking allows you to stake coins stored offline without giving the node operator access to your coins (usually, the operator is the same user as the coins being staked, although not obligatory).</p><p>In that sense, cold staking pools are like special cold staking nodes that allows the pool operator to spend staking rewards on your behalf, but not your coins. This distinction between staking pools and cold staking pools is important because the latter is much more secure. Because the pool doesn’t actually hold any coin other than a few hours worth of staking rewards, there is actually very little to steal for a hacker as the entirety of the staking weight possessed by the cold staking pool isn’t even in their possession. <strong>Cold staking pools keep you in full control of your own funds at all time!</strong></p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><em> You can get the full benefits of the world’s most secure Proof-of-Stake protocol by combining cold staking or cold staking pools to the security of a Ledger Nano S hardware device. This will make your funds impossible to steal even when unlocking your wallet from an infected or compromised computer. To learn more about this, read the “The Ultimate Vulnerability”</em><em><strong> </strong></em><em>section of </em><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae\"><em><strong>this blog post</strong></em></a><em>.

To put that in perspective, consider the moment 1 PART was worth around $50. If you wanted to buy $1,000 worth of Particl, that would have given you around 20 PART. Back then, the staking interest rate was 5%. This meant that, after one full year of staking, you would have earned around 1 PART staking on the network, a yearly reward that is smaller than the payout size. In other words, chances are high that you wouldn’t even have received a single reward during the entire year even though you helped secure the network the whole time. This phenomenon is not unlike “solo mining” with a poor GPU on Proof-of-Work networks.</p><p>Now, with cold staking pools, you could “team up” with the other stakers connected to the same pool as you and get a share of the staking rewards earned by the pool proportional to how much you’ve contributed to it. Instead of waiting a long time to receive one large staking reward, you would receive smaller but more frequent rewards. This makes staking much more interesting and interactive, and also <strong>makes</strong> <strong>staking with fewer coins more stable and reliable</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"easier-to-set-up-for-non-technical-users\">Easier to Set Up for Non-Technical Users</h3><p>Another obstacle to cold staking is the technical level required to set up a cold staking node. Although not overly complicated, especially when following <a href=\"https://particl.news/guide-setting-up-particl-cold-staking-f5d9073bac4\"><strong>the cold staking node setup tutorial</strong></a>, it does require time and effort to correctly execute. It also generally requires the use of a staking device like a Raspberry Pi or a VPS server, all of which adds up to the difficulty and hassle of setting cold staking up.</p><p>On top of that, staking devices need to be maintained quite regularly: you need to make sure it is up 24/7, you need to ideally keep it updated to the latest Particl Core version (especially when there are hardforks), and you need to make sure it is properly restarted when, for example, there is a power outage or something that makes the electricity go off.</p><p>For a lot of users, especially the less technical ones, the dedication it takes to set cold staking up and maintain its device is simply too much. Cold staking pools, on the other hand, do not require you to prepare and manage a staking node since that part is taken care of by the pool operator. <strong>Enabling cold staking has never been as easy as with cold staking pools, and it shouldn’t take more than 2 minutes off of your time</strong>!</p><h3 id=\"more-coins-being-staked\">More Coins Being Staked</h3><p>Because of how much it would benefit some types of users, cold staking pools are likely to encourage more people to stake their coins. This will benefit the network by having fewer available coins on the markets, meaning it would be much harder for an attacker to acquire large sums of PART coins and try to damage the network with a 51% attack. In Proof-of-Stake networks, more coins being put up for staking means it is more secure.</p><p><em><strong>Note: </strong></em><em>Staking pools do present a risk to the network if misused. In fact, while they make 51% attacks harder to execute by reducing the number of coins available on the markets, they could also potentially end up staking 51% of the total network supply if users are not careful enough. As such, we encourage as many people within the community to come up with their own cold staking pools (the source code is </em><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool\"><em><strong>openly available here</strong></em></a><em>) in order to create many different options for users which would lead to a better decentralization of the staking supply.</em></p><hr><h2 id=\"quick-facts\">Quick Facts</h2><ul><li><strong>You can still vote</strong> on Community Proposals and flag listings while your funds are connected to a cold staking pool.</li><li>The <strong>pool operator cannot vote on your behalf, nor can he flag listings </strong>using your coin weight.</li><li>Records can be obtained to verify the pool’s operator <strong>integrity</strong>.</li><li>Payout threshold (the total amount of PART you need to accumulate within the pool before a payout is executed) is set up by the pool operator and can be changed at any time.</li><li>In the future, pools might be able to read specially formatted control transactions, <strong>meaning smart-contracts could potentially interact with them.</strong></li><li>In the future, research might be done to integrate the <strong>Lightning Network</strong> to cold staking pools, which would allow an <strong>almost infinite number of micro-payouts per day</strong> (i.e. multiple payouts throughout the day of 0.01 PART).

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
