Then, on the 26th of July\n[https://particl.news/market-key-generation-contest-e7b93ec14f60?source=collection_home---4------3-----------------------]\n, a contest was initiated to make it more fun — every participant would win a\nfree limited edition Particl t-shirt as well as the chance to win one of 3 free\nTrezor hardware devices that the Particl team is giving away.\n\nIt can now be reported that a whopping 47 sets of Market Keys\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-market/pulls] have been submitted during\nthat period! The submission period was scheduled to end today, on the 5th of\nAugust, at 14:00:00 UTC. This means the submission period is over, and the\nvoting process now begins.\n\nMarket Key Submissions [https://github.com/particl/particl-market/pulls]\nYou can't perform that action at this time. You signed in with another tab or\nwindow. You signed out in another tab or…\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-market/pulls]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-market/pulls]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet‘s Get Voting\nNow’s the time to let your voice be heard. Now’s the time to let people know\nwhat set of Market Keys you want to see used as the default keys for the main\ninterface of the Particl Open Marketplace. In order to make the voting process\nas accessible as possible, we’re taking the process over two different\nplatforms: Particl’s Twitter page and the Particl community forum.\n\nThe first thing you’ll need to do before voting is opening Github to the pull\nrequest page of particl-market. This is where you’ll see all of the Market Key\nsubmissions. Then, simply have a look at the keys and note down the number of\nthe pull request attached to the set of Market Keys you want to submit. Once\nthat’s done, either head over to Twitter or the Particl community forum and cast\nyour vote! The voting period will end on the 8th of August at 4:00:00 (UTC).\n\n> Note: You can only pick Market Keys that have been submitted before the end of\nthe contest. That means you can only vote for pull request #406 to #458.\nTwitter\nVoting on Twitter isn’t really complicated. Simply click the link below to be\nredirected to the tweet used for the voting process, and write in the comment\nsection the number of the pull request attached to the set of Market Keys you’d\nlike to see win this contest. Make sure that the number of the pull request is\nclearly identified.\n\n> \nParticl Community Forum\nTo vote on the forum, simply click on the link below to be redirected to the\nthread used for the voting process and register your vote by writing the number\nof the pull request associated with the set of keys you want to win in the\ncomment section of the thread. If you do not have an account yet, the process of\ncreating one is fairly straight-forward.\n\nMarket Key Voting Thread\n[https://particl.community/t/market-key-voting-thread/591]\nOn the 17th of July, it was announced that the community could start creating\nand submitting sets of Market Keys on…\n[https://particl.community/t/market-key-voting-thread/591]particl.community\n[https://particl.community/t/market-key-voting-thread/591]\n\n> Note: You can vote on both Twitter and the Particl community forum. In that\ncase, you will be casting two votes and both will be registered.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPrizes and How to Claim Them\nAside from being a big part of Particl’s history, there is no prize associated\nwith winning this contest. That’s because the Particl team wants people to vote\nwith their heart and to reduce the number of fraudulent votes.\n\nHowever, everyone that has submitted a set of Market Keys gets a free limited\nedition Particl t-shirt as well as the chance to win one of the three (3) free\nTrezor hardware wallets being given away.\n\nTrezor Winners\nThe three lucky community members who will walk out of this contest with one of\nthe three (3) free Trezor hardware wallets being given away will be announced on\nthe 8th of August, briefly after the voting period for the Market Keys end.\nWinners will be picked at random and will be announced on Twitter as well as on\nParticl’s chat platforms (Discord, Telegram, and Riot). Additionally, the\nwinners will be notified about it right from their pull request on Github as a\ncomment coming from Cryptoguard. Good luck everyone!\n\nClaim Your Prize\nTo claim your prize, head over to Particl’s community forum by following the\nlink below and register using the Github application. Then, go to Cryptoguard’s\nprofile (https://particl.community/u/Cryptoguard/summary) and send him a message\nwith the physical address you want to receive your prize(s).\n\nClaiming your prize(s) and giving away your physical address is entirely\noptional. All addresses will be deleted from our systems a few weeks after the\nprizes are all shipped (so that we can assist you in case of shipping issues).\n\n> Note: You must submit your physical address with an account logged in through\nthe Github login app of the Particl forum. This ensures that you are the right\nperson submitting the address and not an impersonator.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Market-Key-Generation-Contest-Voting-Period/1-QOoDlouL2J6BFxbBkS-YDw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"it-s-time-to-vote\">It’s Time to Vote</h3><p>On the <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-second-anniversary-91e878efa3c0\">17th of July</a>, it was announced that the community could start creating and submitting sets of Market Keys on Github so that they could be used as the default keys for the main interface of the wallet.

There is no third-party or\nintermediary operating it and having any sort of control over its network. It\nuses a mix of P2P and blockchain technologies, meaning that it is exclusively\nrun by its global community of users.\n\nThe Open Marketplace is an equally decentralized application that’s built on top\nof the Particl network. It allows anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and\nservices, physical or digital, regardless of where they are located in the\nworld. And because it is entirely decentralized, there’s no staff or support\nteam to enforce rules and policies.\n\nFurthermore, the Open Marketplace is completely private by default, meaning no\nidentifiable data can be linked to any of its users. Transactions are hidden on\nthe blockchain, images are stripped of their metadata, data exchange is\nencrypted, and you can even connect the marketplace through the Tor network. In\nother words, users of the marketplace are anonymous.\n\nUndesirable Content\nThis, however, introduces a bit of an issue when it comes to the content being\nput on there. After all, how can you prevent anyone from buying or selling\nanything when there are no rules and no central party with special permissions\nto moderate it? Giving special permissions/powers and allowing certain users to\ndelete content and hold such a strong position of power is a slippery slope and,\non a long enough timeline, ultimately a slow crawl back to the old ways where a\ncompany would run its own platform, impose its rules, and charge fees.\n\nBut this isn’t what Particl is about. No, Particl is about full decentralization\nand complete privacy. The recent years, with all of the data breaches like\nEquifax’s and the abuse of data like with the constant scandals involving\nFacebook, have shown without a doubt that the tech industry needs to evolve and\nstart protecting its users.\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f] \nAnd, because data has become so valuable and such a big target for hackers, we\ncannot expect or trust centralized models such as Amazon, Alibaba, eBay, and\ncentral parties, to effectively secure our data.\n\nThis is why Particl’s Open Marketplace is entirely decentralized and\nprivate-by-default. Its “trustless” nature, meaning that you do not need to\ntrust any entity to behave honestly, ensures that none of your data can be\ncollected by any party other than the ones you transact with. It is, simply put,\nthe next logical step in the evolution of eCommerce technology. But like any new\ngroundbreaking technology, it also introduces new challenges. Keeping the\nmarketplace free from undesirable listings is one of them.\n\nDecentralized Governance\nTo fight off undesirable content, Particl has put in place a completely\ndecentralized and provably fair governance mechanism where anyone can vote off\nundesirable listings.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQuick Facts:\n * Voting power ratio: 1 PART coin = 1 vote\n * Delisting threshold at time of publishing: -9,000 PART (adjustable)\n * Need to be staking?: No\n * Fee for flagging an item: Less than 0.001 PART for the first person to flag,\n   free for additional flaggers\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDelisting Threshold\nTo vote against a specific listing, users need to flag it using the Open\nMarketplace user interface. Once the first user marks a listing as undesirable,\nit gets taken into a queue of previously flagged listings where other users will\nbe able to either agree that it should be taken off the marketplace, or disagree\nand vote for it to remain listed. For a listing to be completely delisted, its\nscore needs to reach a certain negative threshold.\n\nParticl’s decentralized moderation system can be compared to the Reddit\nupvote/downvote system. On Reddit, if 5 users downvote a post, and 3 users\nupvote it, the post has a score of -2. Usually, when it reaches a certain\nnegative threshold (i.e. -10), the post is automatically hidden from other\nusers. Reddit counts votes on a 1 user = 1 vote basis.\n\nParticl’s listing moderation system is similar. Each user that flags and votes\nfor a listing contributes to either increasing or decreasing the listing’s\nscore. It also deletes the listing from the user’s personal instance of the\nclient (deleted locally, but not hidden globally until the listing reaches the\ndelisting threshold). But because Particl is private by design and entirely\ndecentralized, there is no real way for the platform to detect a user that\ncreated multiple addresses or used virtual machines to game the system and\nregister fraudulent votes. The network cannot ban an account, blacklist an IP\naddress, or manually adjust votes to try to fight off spam votes.\n\nInstead, Particl counts votes on a 1 coin = 1 vote, which makes it impossible to\ngame the system. If you want to add more power to your votes, you can do it in a\nlegitimate way: acquire more PART coins. No matter how many wallets you use, or\nno matter how many times you try changing your IP address, the system only takes\nthe “coin weight” into consideration when counting votes. This ensures only\nthose with a stake in the network can influence governance outcomes.\n\nThe delisting threshold of the Particl Open Marketplace will be -9,000 during\nthe first mainnet version. That threshold can and will be adjusted on the way\nforward. It may take a few tweaks until the perfect ratio is reached, but\nbecause game-theory is impossible to test on testnet (because test coins don’t\nhold any value), it has to be tested out in the wild.\n\nGame-Theory\nAs you probably now realize, this mechanism is actually pretty simple, but it’s\nalso quite strong and effective. The reason behind this is the whole game-theory \naspect of it.\n\nTo have significant voting power and single-handedly influence votes, a user\nneeds to acquire a lot of coins. This can be quite expensive depending on the\nactive delisting threshold ratio (in the first mainnet version of the\nmarketplace, that threshold will be -9,000), and it only gets more expensive as\nthe platform starts getting more network effect.\n\nAnd because voters have a direct financial stake in the network, they are\ndirectly incentivized to behave correctly. If voters colluded with each other\nand started trolling or censoring the marketplace, that would arguably reduce\nthe value of the network and incur a net loss for all co-conspirators.\n\nAdditionally, if users do not pro-actively keep the public interface of the\nmarketplace clean, it might result in a platform filled with undesirable or\nspammy content, which would contribute to driving people away. That, too, would\nseverely reduce the potential network effect and would be a serious obstacle to\nParticl reaching a more mainstream audience.\n\nSince voters are users with a financial stake in the network, driving users away\nfrom the platform is not something being desired. That is especially true of a\nmarketplace — more users mean more products to buy (for buyers) and more\npotential customers to reach (for vendors). That is why keeping the interface\nclean is a small, but not insignificant, contribution each user can make to the\nnetwork.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFAQ\n * What’s the delisting threshold?\n * The delisting threshold is currently at -9,000 for the first mainnet version\n   of the Open Marketplace. This threshold can and will be adjusted moving\n   forward.\n\n—\n\n * Will listings disappear after I vote them off?\n * When you flag a listing, it is deleted locally, meaning that it is taken off\n   your own personal instance of the marketplace, but not for other users. A\n   listing is only delisted from everyone’s marketplace instance once it reaches\n   the delisting threshold.\n\n—\n\n * Do I need to be staking to vote?\n * No, coins do not need to be staking. Anyone with a coin can vote.\n\n—\n\n * Can I vote if my coins are stored on a hardware device?\n * Not initially, but hardware device support is something being considered for\n   later in the future.\n\n—\n\n * Is there a fee for flagging listings?\n * If you are the first user to flag a listing that has never been flagged\n   before, you will need to be a sub-cent fee (0.00x PART or less). If you are\n   flagging a listing that’s already been flagged before, then there is no fee\n   to be paid.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This build allows you to test the\nnewly introduced “anon” escrow. This escrow system makes all marketplace\ntransactions private-by-default thanks to a combination of the CT and RingCT\nprivacy protocols. This testnet build also contains a vast range of tweaks that\nhave been made to the user interface since the last testnet round.\n\nTo ensure that the code is as stable as it can be and free of any bugs, the\nParticl team is inviting you to participate in a bug bounty where you will be\nrewarded, in PART, if you find any bug within Particl Desktop and the Open\nMarketplace.\n\nSo let’s dive deeper into this bug hunting bounty!\n\n> Note: If any bug is found during this testing round, it will likely be fixed on\nthe spot in internal builds. New builds, batched with multiple bug fixes at\nonce, would then be posted throughout the duration of the bounty, meaning there\ncould potentially be more than one build published during the duration of this\nbug bounty. Reported bugs can only earn you a bounty payment if they’re being\nreported on the latest build publicly available.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCatching Bugs\nThe instructions to participate in this bug bounty are pretty simple:\n\nLatest build version + location of the Report Bug button * Download the latest testnet build of the Open Marketplace. While there is a\n   working testnet version available here\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/], newer builds with\n   fixed bugs may be posted in the #testing channel on either Discord\n   [http://discord.me/particl], Telegram\n   [https://t.me/joinchat/Gpl8aEYMR8go1QYbM-S2qw], or Riot\n   [https://riot.im/app/#/room/#particl-testing:matrix.org]. Always verify that\n   you are running the latest build by checking the #testing channel first.\n * Make a backup of your\n   configuration files, especially wallet.dat.\n * Run it on a clean\n   install (delete all your testnet configuration folders, including\n   Particl/testnet, Particl Desktop/testnet, and Particl Market). Please make\n   sure to backup any mainnet wallet.dat file you have before you do.\n * Report any bug or\n   issue by clicking on the bug icon on Particl Desktop. This will take you to\n   Particl Desktop’s Issue page on Github. Users need to follow the proper\n   template that automatically fills the text field when you create a new Issue.\n\nWhat’s Considered a Bug\nA bug is an unexpected behavior that breaks functionality. It needs to prevent\nusers from using a feature to its full extent. It can also be a miscalculation,\na behavior that causes wrong amounts to be transferred, or information that’s\ndisplayed incorrectly.\n\nBugs are separated into 3 categories: minor, medium, and critical.\n\nMinor bug ($25): A minor bug is any small unexpected outcome that doesn’t break\nthe build in any significant way, but still considerably impacts the user\nexperience in a negative way. A minor bug can be annoying, but won’t prevent you\nfrom accomplishing any action within the marketplace.\n\nA good example of a minor bug could be this one here: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues/1619\n\nMedium bug ($50): A significant bug breaks the build or prevents you from\naccomplishing a certain action. They are more than just annoyances, they prevent\nyou from doing an action.\n\nAn example of what a medium bug could look like would be not being able to add\nan item to your cart, prices of items not showing up on any listing or a button\nthat wouldn’t do anything upon clicking on it.\n\nMajor bug ($100): A critical bug is a major issue that not only breaks the build\nand prevents you from accomplishing a task, but that also could result in a loss\nof funds or an incorrectly transferred amount.\n\nAn example of what a major bug could look like would be if the escrow system\nbreaks up and becomes unusable or sends the wrong amounts to the wrong users.\n\nNOTE: The Particl team has sole discretion over what level a bug is categorized\ninto.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult.

In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from 6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will increase from 3% to 3.5<strong>%</strong> for the next year.
