As you can imagine, this topic can rapidly\nlead to fiery debates on the level of privacy certain protocol implementations\noffer and as to why a certain currency was designed the way it is.\n\nWe’d like, today, to clarify our position on this topic and detail why we’ve\ndecided to follow this particular path.\n\n> Note: In this article, we often refer to RingCT transactions as “anon\ntransactions\". These are used as synonyms.\nTable of Contents\n * About Particl's Native Currency; PART\n * What are Particl Distributed Apps\n * The Need for Public Balances\n * About Particl’s Privacy\n * How Does RingCT Work?\n * Leveraging Particl Applications to Boost Privacy\n * New Privacy Boons Abound\n * So, Should PART Become Private-by-Default?\n * Particl Desktop Privacy Improvements on the Way!\n * Synergy and Collaboration, not Tribalism and Exclusion\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout Particl’s Native Currency; PART\nBefore we get into the nitty-gritty details as to why PART uses an opt-in\nprivacy setup rather than mandating all transactions to be private, it’s\nimportant to understand the context of PART's existence and know what is its\npurpose within the wider Particl ecosystem.\n\nTaken at face value, PART is a proof-of-stake privacy coin that uses the same\nprivacy protocol as Monero (RingCT) but uses the Bitcoin codebase instead of the\nmore rigid Cryptonote one.\n\nThis difference in codebases makes a world of differences. Indeed, leveraging\nthe Bitcoin codebase enables PART to benefit from the sheer strength of the\nentire Bitcoin ecosystem and developer community. That means more developers\nauditing and contributing to the code (Taproot, LN, etc), more stability, and\nmore products and releases to benefit from (Copay, Electrum, etc). But perhaps\nmore importantly, that also means much more flexibility.\n\nAnd that’s where PART shines uniquely and really sets itself apart from other\nprivacy coins. While it uses the proven-effective but typically rigid RingCT and\nCT protocols, it possesses all of Bitcoin's flexibility; massively expanding its\nutility as more than just a private currency. \n\nThis added flexibility makes it possible to use the coin in simple Bitcoin-style\nsmart-contracts and multi-signature contracts. But don’t get fooled by the word\n“basic”, what can be done with “simple smart-contracts” is pretty astonishing in\nitself as demonstrated by distributed apps like Particl Marketplace\n[https://particl.io/marketplace] (decentralized e-commerce) and the recent\nTaproot developments. More on that shortly.\n\nWhat is PART’s Real Intended Purpose?\nWhen we, the Particl team, first envisioned and designed the Particl project, we\nhad a very clear mission in mind: building an ecosystem of distributed\napplications that respect your rights and freedoms. This is our primary focus\nand all further design decisions follow that guiding line.\n\nWe are building these applications for everyone—freedom seekers, the persecuted\nand censored, big and small online sellers, online shoppers, the “typical\ninternet user”, and, among many other types of people, privacy enthusiasts too.\n\nIn that sense, building a privacy coin that only serves as a medium of exchange\nisn’t our objective. PART is a multi-purpose, privacy-focused currency that is\nmore akin to a tool than only a currency. By design, it needs to be flexible\nenough to accomplish various functions within the Particl ecosystem, which is\nachieved by leveraging the benefits of the Bitcoin codebase.\n\nIt is with this need for both multi-purpose flexibility and privacy that we’ve\ndesigned PART’s privacy setup and why we’re confident that it’s doing exactly\nwhat we intended it to do in the first place.\n\nWhat are Particl Distributed Apps\nTo give you a better idea of our vision, let's take one of the distributed\napplications of the Particl ecosystem. Particl Marketplace is a decentralized\nand private-by-default online marketplace that lets you buy and sell anything\nonline with no restriction. Think of it like an eBay, but without any middleman,\ndata mining, restriction, or sales fee/commission.\n\nThis marketplace is made possible thanks to many pieces fitting together: the\nflexibility of the Bitcoin smart-contracts, the use of a custom and unique P2P\nmessaging layer (SMSG), the privacy benefits of the RingCT protocol, a\ndistributed governance system, the anonymity of the Tor network, and the\nsmart-contract capabilities of the Bitcoin-based CT protocol.\n\nAs PART itself directly powers some of these functions (i.e., content\nmoderation), its multi-purpose nature becomes clearer. And as some of these\nfunctions cannot work using anon balances and transactions, the debate on\nwhether we should mandate private transactions or not suddenly becomes more\nnuanced.\n\nThe Need for Public Balances\nRingCT transactions are, by design, quite rigid as their outputs are not\nprogrammable. This prevents anon balances to be used in more complex scenarios,\non various platforms, and for certain use-cases. To circumvent this limitation,\nParticl leverages both public (Bitcoin-like) and CT transactions\n[https://blockstream.com/bitcoin17-final41.pdf]. This “protocol flexibility” is\none of the coin’s most important strengths and expands its utility beyond what\nit could be if it was working exclusively using RingCT.\n\nWhat are Public Balances Used for?\nAt this time, here’s a list of some components of the Particl ecosystem that\nrequire public balances to function:\n\n * The Particl Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism, including cold staking\n   and cold staking pools. There is, however, an option to receive all staking\n   rewards using RingCT or CT transactions for those looking for that extra\n   layer of privacy. To learn more about how to do this, please refer to this\n   article\n   [https://particl.news/private-cold-staking-script-released-d8900e193490/].\n * Particl's decentralized treasury which funds community initiatives.\n * The community governance system [https://ccs.particl.io/] which allows\n   stakeholders to vote on important decisions with their stake weight.\n * The Particl Marketplace community moderation system which lets the users\n   moderate undesirable content off of the marketplace and fight off spam on the\n   platform.\n * The mobile wallet Particl Copay.\n * The light wallet Particl Electrum (desktop and mobile) which is expected to\n   power future mobile and web releases.\n * Hardware devices such as the Ledger Nano S and the Trezor.\n\nAnd, although Particl Marketplace’s two-party escrow system\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_escrow.html] doesn’t rely\non public transactions, it still requires CT transactions to link RingCT outputs\ntogether to provide its anonymity. You can read more on how this is done by\nchecking out this article\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd/].\n\nAs you can see, many critical components of the Particl ecosystem entirely rely\non public balances and transactions. Making PART private-by-default or outright\nmandating private transactions would cause a significant setback and even force\nthe project to abandon some of its core components. This would go in direct\nopposition of our mission.\n\nWhat About Exchanges?\nAnother downside associated with having a private-by-default cryptocurrency has\nto do with the ever-evolving legal landscape of the blockchain industry. As is\nbecoming more evident by the day, regulations are tightening, notably around the\nuse of “privacy coins”. As a result, a lot of leading exchanges have resorted to\ndelisting and/or not entertaining adding privacy coins as a way to protect\nthemselves and ensure that they remain compliant.\n\nWith Particl’s relatively precarious presence on exchanges, having the main\ntransaction type be transparent is a definite upside.\n\nAnd even though exchanges could, in theory, change the type of transactions they\naccept if Particl were to switch to a private-by-default model, they may not be\ninclined to do so purely based on the fact that PART itself has relatively low\nliquidity and volume. The effort involved with implementing that change at the\nexchange level, coupled with the legal uncertainty of accepting privacy coins,\nmay simply not be worth it for exchanges. This could lead to a delisting and\nreduction of accessibility to the PART coin; something that cannot be neglected\nas the coin needs to be as accessible as possible for Particl to accomplish its\nmission.\n\nAuditing the Circulating Supply\nEverything in life has trade-offs. With cryptocurrencies that mandate private\ntransactions like Monero, the added privacy is counter-balanced by the fact that\nthe circulating supply cannot be properly audited with full certainty. And\nalthough the reasons that may cause supply inflation are usually considered more\ntheoretical than practical, they are real risks nonetheless.\n\nBy having public balances on which people hold funds and stake from, you can\ndetermine, with more accuracy, whether or not the total number of coins in\ncirculation is as expected. As the Monero team best wrote it: “(…) the use of\ntransparent fund migration means that an attempt to move enough exploited funds\nthrough the transparent Zcash pool could be detected (…)”. On that note, we\nhighly recommend reading Monero’s well-thought-out response on the topic of\nsupply auditability [https://www.getmonero.org/2020/01/17/auditability.html],\nhow it relates to private (“opaque”) cryptocurrencies, and the trade-offs\ninvolved with this.\n\nIn our particular case, supply auditability isn’t the main reason why we’ve\nopted against mandating private transactions, but it’s certainly an appreciable\nbenefit.\n\nTransaction Speed\nOne non-negligible benefit of having public balances is the faster speed of\ntransaction settlements on Particl. While both public and anon transactions use\nblock confirmation times of 2 minutes, public balances are usable after 1\nconfirmation (~2 minutes) while anon balances can only be used once the funds it\ncontains have reached 12 confirmations (~24 minutes).\n\nThis speed is handy in many situations and straight up required in others,\nnotably in the context of certain Particl applications where the public balance\nholds a key role (i.e., moderating marketplace content).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout PART’s Privacy\nAlthough PART is a multi-purpose coin that accomplishes different functions\nwithin the ecosystem—and, as we’ve just seen, some of these functions cannot\nwork over anon (RingCT) transactions—its privacy is still one of its most\nimportant selling points and development priorities. \n\nWhen debating whether or not PART should be private-by-default, are we asking\nthe right question? Is the entire debate misdirected?\n\nAt its most fundamental level, this debate seeks to find out whether or not\nPART’s current privacy capabilities are good enough to keep people anonymous.\nWhether or not PART mandates RingCT transactions or not is irrelevant as long as\nthe user privacy is solid enough. \n\nIs Particl private-by-default?\nLet’s first clear this question out of the way. No, Particl isn’t\n“private-by-default”, but it is heavily focused on anonymity nonetheless.\n\nKeep in mind, Particl’s mission is first and foremost to provide an ecosystem of\napplications that respect your rights. The race to the top for the absolute most\nprivate cryptocurrency in the space is not our primary focus and purpose. That\nbeing said, PART absolutely qualifies for a spot within the top privacy coins as\nwe are just about to find out.\n\nKeeping our mission in mind, PART is not dedicated exclusively to privacy\nmaximalists but also to a much wider range of audiences that also include people\nthat may not care as much about this specific aspect but more about others, like\ncutting off the middleman from their e-commerce operations, for example.\n\nBut is opt-in privacy, rather than mandated, an actual threat to the quality of\nthat privacy? Let’s see how RingCT works in the first place so that we may be\nable to answer that question after.\n\nHow Does RingCT Work?\nRingCT [https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf] is a combination of the \nConfidential Transactions (CT) [https://blockstream.com/bitcoin17-final41.pdf] \nand Ring Signature privacy protocols. CT keeps transacting amounts private and\nring signatures keep the identity of the participants private.\n\nWhenever you make an anon transaction, the transacting anon outputs are pooled\nup with other anon outputs on the network (ring signatures). These other outputs\npose as \"fake transaction participants\" and merely serve the role of being\nplausibly deniable decoys to hide amongst.\n\nFor an outside party looking into the transaction, it is theoretically not\npossible to tell, with certainty, which of the “participants” actually\nparticipated in the transaction, meaning that neither the value of the amount\ntransferred nor its participants can be traced. And while academic and\ntheoretical attack vectors do exist, as in every privacy protocol, RingCT has\nproven time and time again to be one of the most robust out there.\n\nWhat Contributes to Greater Privacy?\nTo keep things simple, more anon transactions on the network mean more privacy,\nand that privacy gets even better when there’s a constant flow of new legitimate\ntransactions being created. But let's break that down in more detail.\n\nHow private a transaction is, at the protocol level, mainly depends on two\nfactors. On one end, the sender of an anon transaction can increase or decrease\nthe level of its privacy by using a greater or lesser number of \"ring\nsignatures\". More ring signatures means more decoys participating in a\ntransaction and thus, in simple terms, greater expected privacy.\n\nOn the other end, the total number and diversity of these decoys matter greatly.\nBecause RingCT's privacy is obtained by hiding among decoys, its effectiveness\nincreases when there are more of them, and more of them coming from different\nsources, to pick from.\n\nTo understand this better, imagine that you are the sender of an anon\ntransaction that contains 8 ring signatures. Out of these, 2 of them are real\nparticipants (the sender and the receiver) and 6 of them are decoys. If the\nidentity of 4 of these decoys is known to an outside observer (i.e, an exchange,\na blockchain tracing company, etc), that really only leaves you with 2 decoys to\nhide among, making it easier, in theory, for the real participants to be\nidentified. \n\nThat's why having a large number of outputs and transactions on the network\nimproves your privacy. It gives the protocol more decoys to work with, and more\ndiverse ones, effectively reducing your chances of picking up compromised ones.\n\nOn the topic of the diversity in the source of these outputs, it is also very\nimportant as it reduces the chances of picking up decoys known to third-parties\ncollecting data on large numbers of outputs from a single source (i.e., an\nexchange keeping tabs on all the Monero outputs of its users). Note that this\nbecomes a much bigger problem if and when these parties start collaborating\ntogether and sharing their collected data with each other.\n\nOpt-in Privacy and the Human Factor\nAt the protocol level, RingCT's privacy isn't directly affected by whether or\nnot it is mandated or the default transaction type of the blockchain.\n\nIf, for example, Particl’s RingCT layer had a similar number of transactions per\nday as Monero, it would have a somewhat comparable level of privacy at the\nprotocol level. But, in practice, it gets a bit more complicated because, as\nmentioned earlier in this article, everything has trade-offs.\n\nIn the case of opt-in privacy, the trade-off is the human factor. Having the\nability to switch back and forth between public and anon balances opens the door\nto human errors and sub-optimal protocol usage. As with all cryptocurrencies,\nincluding private-by-default assets like Monero, there are some considerations\nand best practices to keep in mind to maintain a good level of privacy. \n\n> Note: The risks typically associated with the human factor are mostly applicable\nto normal peer-to-peer anon transactions between two users. Using Particl\napplications, like the marketplace, significantly reduces the risk of human\nerror by automatically applying some of the recommended best practices.\nLeveraging Particl Applications to Boost Privacy\nAs previously mentioned, the Particl project is much, much more than just a\ncryptocurrency. It's an ecosystem of distributed apps that respect your rights,\nwith one of these rights being the right to privacy. And that's precisely where\nlies Particl's mind-blowing privacy potential; in its apps!\n\nTo understand why that is, let’s take the Particl Marketplace app as an example\nonce again. It lets you buy and sell anything online with no restriction. It is\nprivate by default, meaning that all payments for goods and services have to use\nRingCT. For sellers, there's the option to pay for their listing fees (listing\nan item for sale on the marketplace) using anon transactions. \n\nAnd thus, each item listed on the marketplace generates at least one\ntransaction, meaning that a seller who wants to list 100 items will generate 100\nunique anon transactions alone plus two other anon transactions per sale (as\nboth the buyer and the seller have to make an anon transaction to complete the\nescrow private smart-contract).\n\nAs is self-evident, simple usage of the Particl apps like the marketplace\ndramatically scales the number of real, \"high-quality\" anon transactions per day\non the network up. To get an idea, simply think of how many e-commerce\ntransactions happen every day on the web. How many items are listed online.\nSure, that's an unfairly large segment to compare Particl to, but just think of\nhow many transactions happen just within the still-very-niche decentralized\nmarketplace segment (i.e., OpenSea). \n\n> \"To hide the signal, you must generate noise\" - Kewde, Particl developer\nAs a reference, Monero does around a solid 16,000 transactions per day at the\ntime of writing this piece. Could usage of Particl Marketplace generate similar\nnumbers? The jury is still out but one can speculate.\n\nAnd the cherry on top? Particl Marketplace, and all future Particl applications\nlike the upcoming BasicSwap DEX, is entirely decentralized and trustless.\nThere's no central party able to collect any data about you, your anon outputs,\nor those of other participants on the network; a very unique advantage of\nParticl over other privacy coins.\n\nIn other words, using Particl applications not only increases the number of anon\ntransactions and outputs on the network, but it also does so in a way that\nimproves the quality and effectiveness of available decoys. As current and\nfuture Particl applications gain more adoption, so does the the level of\non-chain privacy as well.\n\nNew Privacy Boons Abound\nParticl is fortunate to be built on the Bitcoin codebase. Indeed, contrary to\nwhat many think, the Bitcoin codebase is evolving rapidly and is going through a\nparticularly innovative phase. That is especially true of recent progress made\non the Lightning Network and Taproot, both of which innovations are available on\nParticl and enhanced by an extra RingCT bridge for added anonymity.\n\nNot mandating RingCT transactions gives us the ability to leverage and combine\nthese breakthrough developments from the Bitcoin community to massively improve\nParticl's privacy and make its applications better for all. \n\nComplex and Private LN-based Smart-Contracts\nIndeed, recent developments have made it possible to run complex smart-contracts\non the Lightning Network. These smart-contracts can even be deployed using CT to\nkeep the amounts transferred confidential. This is a significant development for\nthe Bitcoin community as it dramatically improves your privacy and opens the\ncoin up to even more use-cases. But there is a small caveat; blinded\nsmart-contracts don't hide the identities of people using them; only the\ntransacted amounts remain confidential.\n\nIf that smart-contract was powering the escrow of some hypothetical marketplace,\nit could be possible to tell the identity of the seller and the buyer of a given\ntransaction. On Particl, the additional layer of RingCT would keep both the\nbuyer and the seller private by letting them enter and exit the Lightning\nNetwork without leaving a trace. \n\nTaproot Scripts\nWith Taproot now being enabled on Particl, new on-chain scripting options have\nbecome available. Taproot enables more advanced, but also more private, complex\ntransactions by combining multiple keys and signatures into one. With it, you\ncan pre-emptively program payments within a group of people and trigger them\nfollowing a set of pre-defined conditions. The resulting transactions look just\nlike any other regular transaction on the blockchain and neither the conditions\nnor the identities of the participants are exposed.\n\nThis opens a ton of opportunities, like for example entering and exiting the\nLightning Network more privately\n[https://learningblocks.io/taproot-and-the-lightning-network-a-match-made-in-heaven/]\n, making Particl's treasury entirely decentralized, making BasicSwap DEX swaps\nwith Bitcoin-based currencies look just like a normal transaction, or even \nmaking some core components of Particl quantum-proof\n[https://youtu.be/gF4Mkkhyz1Q?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61KHzhg3JIJdK08JLSlcLId&t=4291].\nAnd that's just to name a few of the possibilites... \n\n> Note: In both the cases of LN and Taproot, it's important to note that RingCT\ntransactions are not directly merged with LN and taproot, but rather run upon\nentering and exiting the L2 network to break the history.\nSo, Should PART Become Private-by-Default?\nUltimately, there is no right or wrong answer to this debate. With both options,\nthere are pros, cons, and trade-offs. There is no perfect solution; it all\ndepends on the purpose of a specific cryptocurrency and the mission it’s trying\nto accomplish. However, we are highly confident that Particl's current privacy\nsetup strikes the optimal utility/privacy balance for what it seeks to\naccomplish and for who it seeks to accomplish it for. \n\nAnd although PART can be said to be less private than competing privacy coins\nsuch as Monero, an obvious statement considering the difference in the number of\ntransactions between the two networks at this present time, its privacy\npotential is just as solid, if not even better, assuming decent usage of\nParticl's distributed applications and that best practices are followed by\nusers.\n\nPART's public addresses provide a lot of capabilities that are key to Particl's\necosystem and they cannot be readily dismissed. For this reason, and for the\nother reasons mentioned earlier in the blog post, the Particl team does not plan\nto switch to an exclusively private-by-default model of transactional privacy in\nthe foreseeable future. We want to reiterate our strong confidence in our\ncurrent model and are focusing on building applications that will organically\nraise the diversity and number of anon transactions and outputs on the network.\n\nThat being said, we remain open to adjusting our position on this matter in the\nfuture depending on how things evolve.\n\nParticl Desktop Privacy Improvements on the Way!\nThe fact that we embrace an opt-in privacy setup doesn't mean we can't work\ntowards reducing potential mistakes caused by the human factor. \n\nAs such, Particl Core contains a few improvements in the RingCT implementation\nthat mitigate some of the risks introduced by the opt-in nature of PART's\nprivacy setup. \n\nAlso, in the next few Particl Desktop updates, you can expect new\nprivacy-focused UI additions and improvements that seek to reduce the risk of\nhuman errors to a minimum. For example, a simple \"churning function\" that\nautomatically churns your anon outputs (generates privacy-enhancing transactions\n(send-to-self) and creates more noise to hide within) to improve your privacy\nand everyone else's as well. Stay tuned to our weekly development updates\n[https://particl.news/tag/progress/] for more information.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSynergy and Collaboration, not Tribalism and Exclusion\nParticl's purpose is to build an ecosystem of apps that respect your rights and\nis as inclusive as possible. The race to the top for the most private features\non a cryptocurrency is something we keep in mind without prime focus, although\nwe fully believe PART can eventually become as such once the adoption of the\nParticl platform grows.\n\nAs part of this vision, we are working on a cross-chain and private\ndecentralized trading exchange (BasicSwap DEX) that lets you swap different\ncryptocurrencies without the use of any third-party.\n\nThat means you can easily enter and exit the Particl ecosystem using your\nfavorite privacy coin such as Monero, for example, and enjoy the benefits of\nboth chains at the same time. \n\nBy combining Monero's private-by-default currency-focused approach and Particl's\napp-focused vision, you can reach strong levels of privacy few people thought\nwere possible. The trade-offs of using an opt-in privacy coin (Particl) can then\nbe offset by using an opt-out one (Monero) on the platform, just like Monero can\noffset its trade-offs (lack of distributed apps and more rigidity) by bridging\ninto the Particl ecosystem using BasicSwap. A win-win situation for both\nblockchains and a major victory for the people.\n\nOnce the DEX is integrated into Particl desktop client, Particl Desktop, the\nsynergy it creates with other privacy coins will take the entire privacy\nenthusiast community to the next level. You'll be able to use distributed and\nprivate applications without making any security or privacy compromise and by\nusing your favorite coin.\n\nIndeed, synergy, not tribalism, is how we see the privacy coin space evolving to\nthe direct benefit of the people. There are many different approaches to privacy\nand it’s difficult to say which one is the best because, in part, use-cases and\ntarget audiences differ so much. And so, why not combine different options and\nwork in unison towards bringing more privacy to the average joe? That's what we\nset out to do with Particl, and what we'll keep giving our blood, sweat, and\ntears to day after day!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJoin the discussion\nWhat's your stance?

Indeed, leveraging the Bitcoin codebase enables PART to benefit from the sheer strength of the entire Bitcoin ecosystem and developer community. That means more developers auditing and contributing to the code (Taproot, LN, etc), more stability, and more products and releases to benefit from (Copay, Electrum, etc). But perhaps more importantly, that also means much more flexibility.</p><p>And that’s where PART shines uniquely and really sets itself apart from other privacy coins. While it uses the proven-effective but typically rigid RingCT and CT protocols, it possesses all of Bitcoin's flexibility; massively expanding its utility as more than just a private currency. </p><p>This added flexibility makes it possible to use the coin in simple Bitcoin-style smart-contracts and multi-signature contracts. But don’t get fooled by the word “basic”, what can be done with “simple smart-contracts” is pretty astonishing in itself as demonstrated by distributed apps like <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</a> (decentralized e-commerce) and the recent Taproot developments. More on that shortly.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-part-s-real-intended-purpose\">What is PART’s Real Intended Purpose?</h3><p>When we, the Particl team, first envisioned and designed the Particl project, we had a very clear mission in mind: building an ecosystem of distributed applications that respect your rights and freedoms. This is our primary focus and all further design decisions follow that guiding line.</p><p>We are building these applications for everyone—freedom seekers, the persecuted and censored, big and small online sellers, online shoppers, the “typical internet user”, and, among many other types of people, privacy enthusiasts too.</p><p>In that sense, building a privacy coin that only serves as a medium of exchange isn’t our objective. PART is a multi-purpose, privacy-focused currency that is more akin to a tool than only a currency. By design, it needs to be flexible enough to accomplish various functions within the Particl ecosystem, which is achieved by leveraging the benefits of the Bitcoin codebase.</p><p>It is with this need for both multi-purpose flexibility and privacy that we’ve designed PART’s privacy setup and why we’re confident that it’s doing exactly what we intended it to do in the first place.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-particl-distributed-apps\">What are Particl Distributed Apps</h2><p>To give you a better idea of our vision, let's take one of the distributed applications of the Particl ecosystem. Particl Marketplace is a decentralized and private-by-default online marketplace that lets you buy and sell anything online with no restriction. Think of it like an eBay, but without any middleman, data mining, restriction, or sales fee/commission.</p><p>This marketplace is made possible thanks to many pieces fitting together: the flexibility of the Bitcoin smart-contracts, the use of a custom and unique P2P messaging layer (SMSG), the privacy benefits of the RingCT protocol, a distributed governance system, the anonymity of the Tor network, and the smart-contract capabilities of the Bitcoin-based CT protocol.</p><p>As PART itself directly powers some of these functions (i.e., content moderation), its multi-purpose nature becomes clearer. And as some of these functions cannot work using anon balances and transactions, the debate on whether we should mandate private transactions or not suddenly becomes more nuanced.</p><h2 id=\"the-need-for-public-balances\">The Need for Public Balances</h2><p>RingCT transactions are, by design, quite rigid as their outputs are not programmable. This prevents anon balances to be used in more complex scenarios, on various platforms, and for certain use-cases. To circumvent this limitation, Particl leverages both public (Bitcoin-like) and <a href=\"https://blockstream.com/bitcoin17-final41.pdf\">CT transactions</a>. This “protocol flexibility” is one of the coin’s most important strengths and expands its utility beyond what it could be if it was working exclusively using RingCT.</p><h3 id=\"what-are-public-balances-used-for\">What are Public Balances Used for?</h3><p>At this time, here’s a list of some components of the Particl ecosystem that require public balances to function:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Particl Proof-of-Stake (PPoS)</strong> consensus mechanism, including cold staking and cold staking pools. There is, however, an option to receive all staking rewards using RingCT or CT transactions for those looking for that extra layer of privacy. To learn more about how to do this, please refer to <a href=\"https://particl.news/private-cold-staking-script-released-d8900e193490/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>this article</strong></a>.</li><li>Particl's <strong>decentralized treasury</strong> which funds community initiatives.</li><li>The <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>community governance system</strong></a> which allows stakeholders to vote on important decisions with their stake weight.</li><li>The <strong>Particl Marketplace</strong> <strong>community moderation system</strong> which lets the users moderate undesirable content off of the marketplace and fight off spam on the platform.</li><li>The <strong>mobile wallet Particl Copay</strong>.</li><li>The <strong>light wallet Particl Electrum</strong> (desktop and mobile) which is expected to power future mobile and web releases.</li><li><strong>Hardware devices</strong> such as the Ledger Nano S and the Trezor.</li></ul><p>And, although Particl Marketplace’s <a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_escrow.html\">two-party escrow system</a> doesn’t rely on public transactions, it still requires CT transactions to link RingCT outputs together to provide its anonymity. You can read more on how this is done by checking out <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>this article</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>As you can see, many critical components of the Particl ecosystem entirely rely on public balances and transactions. Making PART private-by-default or outright mandating private transactions would cause a significant setback and even force the project to abandon some of its core components. This would go in direct opposition of our mission.</p><h3 id=\"what-about-exchanges\">What About Exchanges?</h3><p>Another downside associated with having a private-by-default cryptocurrency has to do with the ever-evolving legal landscape of the blockchain industry. As is becoming more evident by the day, regulations are tightening, notably around the use of “privacy coins”. As a result, a lot of leading exchanges have resorted to delisting and/or not entertaining adding privacy coins as a way to protect themselves and ensure that they remain compliant.</p><p>With Particl’s relatively precarious presence on exchanges, having the main transaction type be transparent is a definite upside.</p><p>And even though exchanges could, in theory, change the type of transactions they accept if Particl were to switch to a private-by-default model, they may not be inclined to do so purely based on the fact that PART itself has relatively low liquidity and volume. The effort involved with implementing that change at the exchange level, coupled with the legal uncertainty of accepting privacy coins, may simply not be worth it for exchanges. This could lead to a delisting and reduction of accessibility to the PART coin; something that cannot be neglected as the coin needs to be as accessible as possible for Particl to accomplish its mission.</p><h3 id=\"auditing-the-circulating-supply\">Auditing the Circulating Supply</h3><p>Everything in life has trade-offs. With cryptocurrencies that mandate private transactions like Monero, the added privacy is counter-balanced by the fact that the circulating supply cannot be properly audited with full certainty. And although the reasons that may cause supply inflation are usually considered more theoretical than practical, they are real risks nonetheless.</p><p>By having public balances on which people hold funds and stake from, you can determine, with more accuracy, whether or not the total number of coins in circulation is as expected. As the Monero team best wrote it: <em>“(…) the use of transparent fund migration means that an attempt to move enough exploited funds through the transparent Zcash pool could be detected (…)”</em>. On that note, we highly recommend reading <a href=\"https://www.getmonero.org/2020/01/17/auditability.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>Monero’s well-thought-out response on the topic of supply auditability</strong></a>, how it relates to private (“opaque”) cryptocurrencies, and the trade-offs involved with this.</p><p>In our particular case, supply auditability isn’t the main reason why we’ve opted against mandating private transactions, but it’s certainly an appreciable benefit.</p><h3 id=\"transaction-speed\">Transaction Speed</h3><p>One non-negligible benefit of having public balances is the faster speed of transaction settlements on Particl.

Is the entire debate misdirected?</p><p>At its most fundamental level, this debate seeks to find out whether or not PART’s current privacy capabilities are good enough to keep people anonymous. Whether or not PART mandates RingCT transactions or not is irrelevant as long as the user privacy is solid enough. </p><h3 id=\"is-particl-private-by-default\">Is Particl private-by-default?</h3><p>Let’s first clear this question out of the way. No, Particl isn’t “private-by-default”, but it is heavily focused on anonymity nonetheless.</p><p>Keep in mind, <strong>Particl’s mission is first and foremost to provide an ecosystem of applications that respect your rights.</strong> The race to the top for the absolute most private cryptocurrency in the space is not our primary focus and purpose. That being said, PART absolutely qualifies for a spot within the top privacy coins as we are just about to find out.</p><p>Keeping our mission in mind, PART is not dedicated exclusively to privacy maximalists but also to a much wider range of audiences that also include people that may not care as much about this specific aspect but more about others, like cutting off the middleman from their e-commerce operations, for example.</p><p>But is opt-in privacy, rather than mandated, an actual threat to the quality of that privacy? Let’s see how RingCT works in the first place so that we may be able to answer that question after.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-ringct-work\">How Does RingCT Work?</h2><p><a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf\">RingCT</a> is a combination of the <a href=\"https://blockstream.com/bitcoin17-final41.pdf\">Confidential Transactions (CT)</a> and Ring Signature privacy protocols. CT keeps transacting amounts private and ring signatures keep the identity of the participants private.</p><p>Whenever you make an anon transaction, the transacting anon outputs are pooled up with other anon outputs on the network (ring signatures). These other outputs pose as \"fake transaction participants\" and merely serve the role of being plausibly deniable decoys to hide amongst.</p><p>For an outside party looking into the transaction, it is theoretically not possible to tell, with certainty, which of the “participants” actually participated in the transaction, meaning that neither the value of the amount transferred nor its participants can be traced. And while academic and theoretical attack vectors do exist, as in every privacy protocol, RingCT has proven time and time again to be one of the most robust out there.</p><h3 id=\"what-contributes-to-greater-privacy\">What Contributes to Greater Privacy?</h3><p>To keep things simple, more anon transactions on the network mean more privacy, and that privacy gets even better when there’s a constant flow of new legitimate transactions being created. But let's break that down in more detail.</p><p>How private a transaction is, at the protocol level, mainly depends on two factors. On one end, the sender of an anon transaction can increase or decrease the level of its privacy by using a greater or lesser number of \"ring signatures\". More ring signatures means more decoys participating in a transaction and thus, in simple terms, greater expected privacy.</p><p>On the other end, the total number and diversity of these decoys matter greatly. Because RingCT's privacy is obtained by hiding among decoys, its effectiveness increases when there are more of them, and more of them coming from different sources, to pick from.</p><p>To understand this better, imagine that you are the sender of an anon transaction that contains 8 ring signatures. Out of these, 2 of them are real participants (the sender and the receiver) and 6 of them are decoys. If the identity of 4 of these decoys is known to an outside observer (i.e, an exchange, a blockchain tracing company, etc), that really only leaves you with 2 decoys to hide among, making it easier, in theory, for the real participants to be identified. </p><p>That's why having a large number of outputs and transactions on the network improves your privacy. It gives the protocol more decoys to work with, and more diverse ones, effectively reducing your chances of picking up compromised ones.</p><p>On the topic of the diversity in the source of these outputs, it is also very important as it reduces the chances of picking up decoys known to third-parties collecting data on large numbers of outputs from a single source (i.e., an exchange keeping tabs on all the Monero outputs of its users). Note that this becomes a much bigger problem if and when these parties start collaborating together and sharing their collected data with each other.</p><h3 id=\"opt-in-privacy-and-the-human-factor\">Opt-in Privacy and the Human Factor</h3><p>At the protocol level, RingCT's privacy isn't directly affected by whether or not it is mandated or the default transaction type of the blockchain.</p><p>If, for example, Particl’s RingCT layer had a similar number of transactions per day as Monero, it would have a somewhat comparable level of privacy <strong>at the protocol level</strong>. But, in practice, it gets a bit more complicated because, as mentioned earlier in this article, everything has trade-offs.</p><p>In the case of opt-in privacy, the trade-off is the human factor. Having the ability to switch back and forth between public and anon balances opens the door to human errors and sub-optimal protocol usage. As with all cryptocurrencies, including private-by-default assets like Monero, there are some considerations and best practices to keep in mind to maintain a good level of privacy. </p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> The risks typically associated with the human factor are mostly applicable to normal peer-to-peer anon transactions between two users. Using Particl applications, like the marketplace, significantly reduces the risk of human error by automatically applying some of the recommended best practices.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"leveraging-particl-applications-to-boost-privacy\">Leveraging Particl Applications to Boost Privacy</h2><p>As previously mentioned, the Particl project is much, much more than just a cryptocurrency. It's an ecosystem of distributed apps that respect your rights, with one of these rights being the right to privacy. And that's precisely where lies Particl's mind-blowing privacy potential; in its apps!</p><p>To understand why that is, let’s take the Particl Marketplace app as an example once again. It lets you buy and sell anything online with no restriction. It is private by default, meaning that all payments for goods and services have to use RingCT. For sellers, there's the option to pay for their listing fees (listing an item for sale on the marketplace) using anon transactions. </p><p>And thus, each item listed on the marketplace generates at least one transaction, meaning that a seller who wants to list 100 items will generate 100 unique anon transactions alone plus two other anon transactions per sale (as both the buyer and the seller have to make an anon transaction to complete the escrow private smart-contract).</p><p>As is self-evident, simple usage of the Particl apps like the marketplace dramatically scales the number of real, \"high-quality\" anon transactions per day on the network up. To get an idea, simply think of how many e-commerce transactions happen every day on the web. How many items are listed online. Sure, that's an unfairly large segment to compare Particl to, but just think of how many transactions happen just within the still-very-niche decentralized marketplace segment (i.e., OpenSea). </p><blockquote><em>\"To hide the signal, you must generate noise\"</em> - Kewde, Particl developer</blockquote><p>As a reference, Monero does around a solid 16,000 transactions per day at the time of writing this piece. Could usage of Particl Marketplace generate similar numbers? The jury is still out but one can speculate.</p><p>And the cherry on top? Particl Marketplace, and all future Particl applications like the upcoming BasicSwap DEX, is entirely decentralized and trustless. There's no central party able to collect any data about you, your anon outputs, or those of other participants on the network; a very unique advantage of Particl over other privacy coins.</p><p>In other words, using Particl applications not only increases the number of anon transactions and outputs on the network, but it also does so in a way that improves the quality and effectiveness of available decoys. As current and future Particl applications gain more adoption, so does the the level of on-chain privacy as well.</p><h2 id=\"new-privacy-boons-abound\">New Privacy Boons Abound</h2><p>Particl is fortunate to be built on the Bitcoin codebase. Indeed, contrary to what many think, the Bitcoin codebase is evolving rapidly and is going through a particularly innovative phase. That is especially true of recent progress made on the Lightning Network and Taproot, both of which innovations are available on Particl and enhanced by an extra RingCT bridge for added anonymity.</p><p>Not mandating RingCT transactions gives us the ability to leverage and combine these breakthrough developments from the Bitcoin community to massively improve Particl's privacy and make its applications better for all. </p><p><strong>Complex and Private LN-based Smart-Contracts</strong><br>Indeed, recent developments have made it possible to run complex smart-contracts on the Lightning Network. These smart-contracts can even be deployed using CT to keep the amounts transferred confidential. This is a significant development for the Bitcoin community as it dramatically improves your privacy and opens the coin up to even more use-cases. But there is a small caveat; blinded smart-contracts don't hide the identities of people using them; only the transacted amounts remain confidential.</p><p>If that smart-contract was powering the escrow of some hypothetical marketplace, it could be possible to tell the identity of the seller and the buyer of a given transaction. On Particl, the additional layer of RingCT would keep both the buyer and the seller private by letting them enter and exit the Lightning Network without leaving a trace. </p><p><strong>Taproot Scripts</strong><br>With Taproot now being enabled on Particl, new on-chain scripting options have become available. Taproot enables more advanced, but also more private, complex transactions by combining multiple keys and signatures into one. With it, you can pre-emptively program payments within a group of people and trigger them following a set of pre-defined conditions. The resulting transactions look just like any other regular transaction on the blockchain and neither the conditions nor the identities of the participants are exposed.  </p><p>This opens a ton of opportunities, like for example <a href=\"https://learningblocks.io/taproot-and-the-lightning-network-a-match-made-in-heaven/\">entering and exiting the Lightning Network more privately</a>, making Particl's treasury entirely decentralized, making BasicSwap DEX swaps with Bitcoin-based currencies look just like a normal transaction, or even <a href=\"https://youtu.be/gF4Mkkhyz1Q?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61KHzhg3JIJdK08JLSlcLId&amp;t=4291\">making some core components of Particl quantum-proof</a>. And that's just to name a few of the possibilites... </p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> In both the cases of LN and Taproot, it's important to note that RingCT transactions are not directly merged with LN and taproot, but rather run upon entering and exiting the L2 network to break the history.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"so-should-part-become-private-by-default\">So, Should PART Become Private-by-Default?</h2><p>Ultimately, there is no right or wrong answer to this debate. With both options, there are pros, cons, and trade-offs. There is no perfect solution; it all depends on the purpose of a specific cryptocurrency and the mission it’s trying to accomplish. However, we are highly confident that Particl's current privacy setup strikes the optimal utility/privacy balance for what it seeks to accomplish and for who it seeks to accomplish it for. </p><p>And although PART can be said to be less private than competing privacy coins such as Monero, an obvious statement considering the difference in the number of transactions between the two networks <strong>at this present time</strong>, its privacy potential is just as solid, if not even better, assuming decent usage of Particl's distributed applications and that best practices are followed by users.</p><p>PART's public addresses provide a lot of capabilities that are key to Particl's ecosystem and they cannot be readily dismissed. For this reason, and for the other reasons mentioned earlier in the blog post, <strong>the Particl team does not plan to switch to an exclusively private-by-default model of transactional privacy in the foreseeable future</strong>. We want to reiterate our strong confidence in our current model and are focusing on building applications that will organically raise the diversity and number of anon transactions and outputs on the network.</p><p>That being said, we remain open to adjusting our position on this matter in the future depending on how things evolve.</p><h2 id=\"particl-desktop-privacy-improvements-on-the-way-\">Particl Desktop Privacy Improvements on the Way!</h2><p>The fact that we embrace an opt-in privacy setup doesn't mean we can't work towards reducing potential mistakes caused by the human factor. </p><p>As such, Particl Core contains a few improvements in the RingCT implementation that mitigate some of the risks introduced by the opt-in nature of PART's privacy setup. </p><p>Also, <strong>in the next few Particl Desktop updates</strong>, you can expect new privacy-focused UI additions and improvements that seek to reduce the risk of human errors to a minimum. For example, a simple \"churning function\" that automatically churns your anon outputs (generates privacy-enhancing transactions (send-to-self) and creates more noise to hide within) to improve your privacy and everyone else's as well. Stay tuned to our <a href=\"https://particl.news/tag/progress/\"><strong>weekly development updates</strong></a> for more information.</p><hr><h2 id=\"synergy-and-collaboration-not-tribalism-and-exclusion\">Synergy and Collaboration, not Tribalism and Exclusion</h2><p>Particl's purpose is to build an ecosystem of apps that respect your rights and is as inclusive as possible. The race to the top for the most private features on a cryptocurrency is something we keep in mind without prime focus, although we fully believe PART can eventually become as such once the adoption of the Particl platform grows.</p><p>As part of this vision, we are working on a cross-chain and private decentralized trading exchange (BasicSwap DEX) that lets you swap different cryptocurrencies without the use of any third-party.</p><p>That means you can easily enter and exit the Particl ecosystem using your favorite privacy coin such as Monero, for example, and enjoy the benefits of both chains at the same time. </p><p>By combining Monero's private-by-default currency-focused approach and Particl's app-focused vision, you can reach strong levels of privacy few people thought were possible. The trade-offs of using an opt-in privacy coin (Particl) can then be offset by using an opt-out one (Monero) on the platform, just like Monero can offset its trade-offs (lack of distributed apps and more rigidity) by bridging into the Particl ecosystem using BasicSwap. A win-win situation for both blockchains and a major victory for the people.</p><p>Once the DEX is integrated into Particl desktop client, Particl Desktop, the synergy it creates with other privacy coins will take the entire privacy enthusiast community to the next level. You'll be able to use distributed and private applications without making any security or privacy compromise and by using your favorite coin.</p><p>Indeed, synergy, not tribalism, is how we see the privacy coin space evolving to the direct benefit of the people. There are many different approaches to privacy and it’s difficult to say which one is the best because, in part, use-cases and target audiences differ so much. And so, why not combine different options and work in unison towards bringing more privacy to the average joe? That's what we set out to do with Particl, and what we'll keep giving our blood, sweat, and tears to day after day!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr>\n<h3 id=\"join-the-discussion\">Join the discussion</h3>\n<p>What's your stance?

These are used as synonyms.</em></blockquote><h3 id=\"table-of-contents\">Table of Contents</h3><ul><li><a href=\"#about-particl-s-native-currency-part\">About Particl's Native Currency; PART</a></li><li><a href=\"#what-are-particl-distributed-apps\">What are Particl Distributed Apps</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-need-for-public-balances\">The Need for Public Balances</a></li><li><a href=\"#about-part-s-privacy\">About Particl’s Privacy</a></li><li><a href=\"#how-does-ringct-work\">How Does RingCT Work?</a></li><li><a href=\"#leveraging-particl-applications-to-boost-privacy\">Leveraging Particl Applications to Boost Privacy</a></li><li><a href=\"#new-privacy-boons-abound\">New Privacy Boons Abound</a></li><li><a href=\"#so-should-part-become-private-by-default\">So, Should PART Become Private-by-Default?</a></li><li><a href=\"#particl-desktop-privacy-improvements-on-the-way-\">Particl Desktop Privacy Improvements on the Way!</a></li><li><a href=\"#synergy-and-collaboration-not-tribalism-and-exclusion\">Synergy and Collaboration, not Tribalism and Exclusion</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id=\"about-particl-s-native-currency-part\">About Particl’s Native Currency; PART</h2><p>Before we get into the nitty-gritty details as to why PART uses an opt-in privacy setup rather than mandating all transactions to be private, it’s important to understand the context of PART's existence and know what is its purpose within the wider Particl ecosystem.</p><p>Taken at face value, PART is a proof-of-stake privacy coin that uses the same privacy protocol as Monero (RingCT) but uses the Bitcoin codebase instead of the more rigid Cryptonote one.</p><p>This difference in codebases makes a world of differences. Indeed, leveraging the Bitcoin codebase enables PART to benefit from the sheer strength of the entire Bitcoin ecosystem and developer community. That means more developers auditing and contributing to the code (Taproot, LN, etc), more stability, and more products and releases to benefit from (Copay, Electrum, etc). But perhaps more importantly, that also means much more flexibility.</p><p>And that’s where PART shines uniquely and really sets itself apart from other privacy coins. While it uses the proven-effective but typically rigid RingCT and CT protocols, it possesses all of Bitcoin's flexibility; massively expanding its utility as more than just a private currency. </p><p>This added flexibility makes it possible to use the coin in simple Bitcoin-style smart-contracts and multi-signature contracts. But don’t get fooled by the word “basic”, what can be done with “simple smart-contracts” is pretty astonishing in itself as demonstrated by distributed apps like <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</a> (decentralized e-commerce) and the recent Taproot developments. More on that shortly.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-part-s-real-intended-purpose\">What is PART’s Real Intended Purpose?</h3><p>When we, the Particl team, first envisioned and designed the Particl project, we had a very clear mission in mind: building an ecosystem of distributed applications that respect your rights and freedoms. This is our primary focus and all further design decisions follow that guiding line.</p><p>We are building these applications for everyone—freedom seekers, the persecuted and censored, big and small online sellers, online shoppers, the “typical internet user”, and, among many other types of people, privacy enthusiasts too.</p><p>In that sense, building a privacy coin that only serves as a medium of exchange isn’t our objective. PART is a multi-purpose, privacy-focused currency that is more akin to a tool than only a currency. By design, it needs to be flexible enough to accomplish various functions within the Particl ecosystem, which is achieved by leveraging the benefits of the Bitcoin codebase.</p><p>It is with this need for both multi-purpose flexibility and privacy that we’ve designed PART’s privacy setup and why we’re confident that it’s doing exactly what we intended it to do in the first place.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-particl-distributed-apps\">What are Particl Distributed Apps</h2><p>To give you a better idea of our vision, let's take one of the distributed applications of the Particl ecosystem. Particl Marketplace is a decentralized and private-by-default online marketplace that lets you buy and sell anything online with no restriction. Think of it like an eBay, but without any middleman, data mining, restriction, or sales fee/commission.</p><p>This marketplace is made possible thanks to many pieces fitting together: the flexibility of the Bitcoin smart-contracts, the use of a custom and unique P2P messaging layer (SMSG), the privacy benefits of the RingCT protocol, a distributed governance system, the anonymity of the Tor network, and the smart-contract capabilities of the Bitcoin-based CT protocol.</p><p>As PART itself directly powers some of these functions (i.e., content moderation), its multi-purpose nature becomes clearer. And as some of these functions cannot work using anon balances and transactions, the debate on whether we should mandate private transactions or not suddenly becomes more nuanced.</p><h2 id=\"the-need-for-public-balances\">The Need for Public Balances</h2><p>RingCT transactions are, by design, quite rigid as their outputs are not programmable. This prevents anon balances to be used in more complex scenarios, on various platforms, and for certain use-cases. To circumvent this limitation, Particl leverages both public (Bitcoin-like) and <a href=\"https://blockstream.com/bitcoin17-final41.pdf\">CT transactions</a>. This “protocol flexibility” is one of the coin’s most important strengths and expands its utility beyond what it could be if it was working exclusively using RingCT.</p><h3 id=\"what-are-public-balances-used-for\">What are Public Balances Used for?</h3><p>At this time, here’s a list of some components of the Particl ecosystem that require public balances to function:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Particl Proof-of-Stake (PPoS)</strong> consensus mechanism, including cold staking and cold staking pools. There is, however, an option to receive all staking rewards using RingCT or CT transactions for those looking for that extra layer of privacy. To learn more about how to do this, please refer to <a href=\"https://particl.news/private-cold-staking-script-released-d8900e193490/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>this article</strong></a>.</li><li>Particl's <strong>decentralized treasury</strong> which funds community initiatives.</li><li>The <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>community governance system</strong></a> which allows stakeholders to vote on important decisions with their stake weight.</li><li>The <strong>Particl Marketplace</strong> <strong>community moderation system</strong> which lets the users moderate undesirable content off of the marketplace and fight off spam on the platform.</li><li>The <strong>mobile wallet Particl Copay</strong>.</li><li>The <strong>light wallet Particl Electrum</strong> (desktop and mobile) which is expected to power future mobile and web releases.</li><li><strong>Hardware devices</strong> such as the Ledger Nano S and the Trezor.</li></ul><p>And, although Particl Marketplace’s <a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_escrow.html\">two-party escrow system</a> doesn’t rely on public transactions, it still requires CT transactions to link RingCT outputs together to provide its anonymity. You can read more on how this is done by checking out <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>this article</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>As you can see, many critical components of the Particl ecosystem entirely rely on public balances and transactions. Making PART private-by-default or outright mandating private transactions would cause a significant setback and even force the project to abandon some of its core components. This would go in direct opposition of our mission.</p><h3 id=\"what-about-exchanges\">What About Exchanges?</h3><p>Another downside associated with having a private-by-default cryptocurrency has to do with the ever-evolving legal landscape of the blockchain industry. As is becoming more evident by the day, regulations are tightening, notably around the use of “privacy coins”. As a result, a lot of leading exchanges have resorted to delisting and/or not entertaining adding privacy coins as a way to protect themselves and ensure that they remain compliant.</p><p>With Particl’s relatively precarious presence on exchanges, having the main transaction type be transparent is a definite upside.</p><p>And even though exchanges could, in theory, change the type of transactions they accept if Particl were to switch to a private-by-default model, they may not be inclined to do so purely based on the fact that PART itself has relatively low liquidity and volume. The effort involved with implementing that change at the exchange level, coupled with the legal uncertainty of accepting privacy coins, may simply not be worth it for exchanges. This could lead to a delisting and reduction of accessibility to the PART coin; something that cannot be neglected as the coin needs to be as accessible as possible for Particl to accomplish its mission.</p><h3 id=\"auditing-the-circulating-supply\">Auditing the Circulating Supply</h3><p>Everything in life has trade-offs. With cryptocurrencies that mandate private transactions like Monero, the added privacy is counter-balanced by the fact that the circulating supply cannot be properly audited with full certainty. And although the reasons that may cause supply inflation are usually considered more theoretical than practical, they are real risks nonetheless.</p><p>By having public balances on which people hold funds and stake from, you can determine, with more accuracy, whether or not the total number of coins in circulation is as expected. As the Monero team best wrote it: <em>“(…) the use of transparent fund migration means that an attempt to move enough exploited funds through the transparent Zcash pool could be detected (…)”</em>. On that note, we highly recommend reading <a href=\"https://www.getmonero.org/2020/01/17/auditability.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>Monero’s well-thought-out response on the topic of supply auditability</strong></a>, how it relates to private (“opaque”) cryptocurrencies, and the trade-offs involved with this.</p><p>In our particular case, supply auditability isn’t the main reason why we’ve opted against mandating private transactions, but it’s certainly an appreciable benefit.</p><h3 id=\"transaction-speed\">Transaction Speed</h3><p>One non-negligible benefit of having public balances is the faster speed of transaction settlements on Particl. While both public and anon transactions use block confirmation times of 2 minutes, public balances are usable after 1 confirmation (~2 minutes) while anon balances can only be used once the funds it contains have reached 12 confirmations (~24 minutes).</p><p>This speed is handy in many situations and straight up required in others, notably in the context of certain Particl applications where the public balance holds a key role (i.e., moderating marketplace content).</p><hr><h2 id=\"about-part-s-privacy\">About PART’s Privacy</h2><p>Although PART is a multi-purpose coin that accomplishes different functions within the ecosystem—and, as we’ve just seen, some of these functions cannot work over anon (RingCT) transactions—its privacy is still one of its most important selling points and development priorities. </p><p>When debating whether or not PART should be private-by-default, are we asking the right question?

No, Particl isn’t “private-by-default”, but it is heavily focused on anonymity nonetheless.</p><p>Keep in mind, <strong>Particl’s mission is first and foremost to provide an ecosystem of applications that respect your rights.</strong> The race to the top for the absolute most private cryptocurrency in the space is not our primary focus and purpose.

And while academic and theoretical attack vectors do exist, as in every privacy protocol, RingCT has proven time and time again to be one of the most robust out there.</p><h3 id=\"what-contributes-to-greater-privacy\">What Contributes to Greater Privacy?</h3><p>To keep things simple, more anon transactions on the network mean more privacy, and that privacy gets even better when there’s a constant flow of new legitimate transactions being created. But let's break that down in more detail.</p><p>How private a transaction is, at the protocol level, mainly depends on two factors. On one end, the sender of an anon transaction can increase or decrease the level of its privacy by using a greater or lesser number of \"ring signatures\". More ring signatures means more decoys participating in a transaction and thus, in simple terms, greater expected privacy.</p><p>On the other end, the total number and diversity of these decoys matter greatly. Because RingCT's privacy is obtained by hiding among decoys, its effectiveness increases when there are more of them, and more of them coming from different sources, to pick from.</p><p>To understand this better, imagine that you are the sender of an anon transaction that contains 8 ring signatures. Out of these, 2 of them are real participants (the sender and the receiver) and 6 of them are decoys. If the identity of 4 of these decoys is known to an outside observer (i.e, an exchange, a blockchain tracing company, etc), that really only leaves you with 2 decoys to hide among, making it easier, in theory, for the real participants to be identified. </p><p>That's why having a large number of outputs and transactions on the network improves your privacy. It gives the protocol more decoys to work with, and more diverse ones, effectively reducing your chances of picking up compromised ones.</p><p>On the topic of the diversity in the source of these outputs, it is also very important as it reduces the chances of picking up decoys known to third-parties collecting data on large numbers of outputs from a single source (i.e., an exchange keeping tabs on all the Monero outputs of its users). Note that this becomes a much bigger problem if and when these parties start collaborating together and sharing their collected data with each other.</p><h3 id=\"opt-in-privacy-and-the-human-factor\">Opt-in Privacy and the Human Factor</h3><p>At the protocol level, RingCT's privacy isn't directly affected by whether or not it is mandated or the default transaction type of the blockchain.</p><p>If, for example, Particl’s RingCT layer had a similar number of transactions per day as Monero, it would have a somewhat comparable level of privacy <strong>at the protocol level</strong>. But, in practice, it gets a bit more complicated because, as mentioned earlier in this article, everything has trade-offs.</p><p>In the case of opt-in privacy, the trade-off is the human factor. Having the ability to switch back and forth between public and anon balances opens the door to human errors and sub-optimal protocol usage. As with all cryptocurrencies, including private-by-default assets like Monero, there are some considerations and best practices to keep in mind to maintain a good level of privacy. </p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> The risks typically associated with the human factor are mostly applicable to normal peer-to-peer anon transactions between two users. Using Particl applications, like the marketplace, significantly reduces the risk of human error by automatically applying some of the recommended best practices.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"leveraging-particl-applications-to-boost-privacy\">Leveraging Particl Applications to Boost Privacy</h2><p>As previously mentioned, the Particl project is much, much more than just a cryptocurrency. It's an ecosystem of distributed apps that respect your rights, with one of these rights being the right to privacy. And that's precisely where lies Particl's mind-blowing privacy potential; in its apps!</p><p>To understand why that is, let’s take the Particl Marketplace app as an example once again. It lets you buy and sell anything online with no restriction. It is private by default, meaning that all payments for goods and services have to use RingCT. For sellers, there's the option to pay for their listing fees (listing an item for sale on the marketplace) using anon transactions. </p><p>And thus, each item listed on the marketplace generates at least one transaction, meaning that a seller who wants to list 100 items will generate 100 unique anon transactions alone plus two other anon transactions per sale (as both the buyer and the seller have to make an anon transaction to complete the escrow private smart-contract).</p><p>As is self-evident, simple usage of the Particl apps like the marketplace dramatically scales the number of real, \"high-quality\" anon transactions per day on the network up. To get an idea, simply think of how many e-commerce transactions happen every day on the web. How many items are listed online. Sure, that's an unfairly large segment to compare Particl to, but just think of how many transactions happen just within the still-very-niche decentralized marketplace segment (i.e., OpenSea). </p><blockquote><em>\"To hide the signal, you must generate noise\"</em> - Kewde, Particl developer</blockquote><p>As a reference, Monero does around a solid 16,000 transactions per day at the time of writing this piece. Could usage of Particl Marketplace generate similar numbers? The jury is still out but one can speculate.</p><p>And the cherry on top? Particl Marketplace, and all future Particl applications like the upcoming BasicSwap DEX, is entirely decentralized and trustless. There's no central party able to collect any data about you, your anon outputs, or those of other participants on the network; a very unique advantage of Particl over other privacy coins.</p><p>In other words, using Particl applications not only increases the number of anon transactions and outputs on the network, but it also does so in a way that improves the quality and effectiveness of available decoys. As current and future Particl applications gain more adoption, so does the the level of on-chain privacy as well.</p><h2 id=\"new-privacy-boons-abound\">New Privacy Boons Abound</h2><p>Particl is fortunate to be built on the Bitcoin codebase. Indeed, contrary to what many think, the Bitcoin codebase is evolving rapidly and is going through a particularly innovative phase. That is especially true of recent progress made on the Lightning Network and Taproot, both of which innovations are available on Particl and enhanced by an extra RingCT bridge for added anonymity.</p><p>Not mandating RingCT transactions gives us the ability to leverage and combine these breakthrough developments from the Bitcoin community to massively improve Particl's privacy and make its applications better for all. </p><p><strong>Complex and Private LN-based Smart-Contracts</strong><br>Indeed, recent developments have made it possible to run complex smart-contracts on the Lightning Network. These smart-contracts can even be deployed using CT to keep the amounts transferred confidential. This is a significant development for the Bitcoin community as it dramatically improves your privacy and opens the coin up to even more use-cases. But there is a small caveat; blinded smart-contracts don't hide the identities of people using them; only the transacted amounts remain confidential.</p><p>If that smart-contract was powering the escrow of some hypothetical marketplace, it could be possible to tell the identity of the seller and the buyer of a given transaction. On Particl, the additional layer of RingCT would keep both the buyer and the seller private by letting them enter and exit the Lightning Network without leaving a trace. </p><p><strong>Taproot Scripts</strong><br>With Taproot now being enabled on Particl, new on-chain scripting options have become available. Taproot enables more advanced, but also more private, complex transactions by combining multiple keys and signatures into one. With it, you can pre-emptively program payments within a group of people and trigger them following a set of pre-defined conditions. The resulting transactions look just like any other regular transaction on the blockchain and neither the conditions nor the identities of the participants are exposed.  </p><p>This opens a ton of opportunities, like for example <a href=\"https://learningblocks.io/taproot-and-the-lightning-network-a-match-made-in-heaven/\">entering and exiting the Lightning Network more privately</a>, making Particl's treasury entirely decentralized, making BasicSwap DEX swaps with Bitcoin-based currencies look just like a normal transaction, or even <a href=\"https://youtu.be/gF4Mkkhyz1Q?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61KHzhg3JIJdK08JLSlcLId&#x26;t=4291\">making some core components of Particl quantum-proof</a>. And that's just to name a few of the possibilites... </p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> In both the cases of LN and Taproot, it's important to note that RingCT transactions are not directly merged with LN and taproot, but rather run upon entering and exiting the L2 network to break the history.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"so-should-part-become-private-by-default\">So, Should PART Become Private-by-Default?</h2><p>Ultimately, there is no right or wrong answer to this debate. With both options, there are pros, cons, and trade-offs. There is no perfect solution; it all depends on the purpose of a specific cryptocurrency and the mission it’s trying to accomplish. However, we are highly confident that Particl's current privacy setup strikes the optimal utility/privacy balance for what it seeks to accomplish and for who it seeks to accomplish it for. </p><p>And although PART can be said to be less private than competing privacy coins such as Monero, an obvious statement considering the difference in the number of transactions between the two networks <strong>at this present time</strong>, its privacy potential is just as solid, if not even better, assuming decent usage of Particl's distributed applications and that best practices are followed by users.</p><p>PART's public addresses provide a lot of capabilities that are key to Particl's ecosystem and they cannot be readily dismissed. For this reason, and for the other reasons mentioned earlier in the blog post, <strong>the Particl team does not plan to switch to an exclusively private-by-default model of transactional privacy in the foreseeable future</strong>. We want to reiterate our strong confidence in our current model and are focusing on building applications that will organically raise the diversity and number of anon transactions and outputs on the network.</p><p>That being said, we remain open to adjusting our position on this matter in the future depending on how things evolve.</p><h2 id=\"particl-desktop-privacy-improvements-on-the-way-\">Particl Desktop Privacy Improvements on the Way!</h2><p>The fact that we embrace an opt-in privacy setup doesn't mean we can't work towards reducing potential mistakes caused by the human factor. </p><p>As such, Particl Core contains a few improvements in the RingCT implementation that mitigate some of the risks introduced by the opt-in nature of PART's privacy setup. </p><p>Also, <strong>in the next few Particl Desktop updates</strong>, you can expect new privacy-focused UI additions and improvements that seek to reduce the risk of human errors to a minimum. For example, a simple \"churning function\" that automatically churns your anon outputs (generates privacy-enhancing transactions (send-to-self) and creates more noise to hide within) to improve your privacy and everyone else's as well. Stay tuned to our <a href=\"https://particl.news/tag/progress/\"><strong>weekly development updates</strong></a> for more information.</p><hr><h2 id=\"synergy-and-collaboration-not-tribalism-and-exclusion\">Synergy and Collaboration, not Tribalism and Exclusion</h2><p>Particl's purpose is to build an ecosystem of apps that respect your rights and is as inclusive as possible. The race to the top for the most private features on a cryptocurrency is something we keep in mind without prime focus, although we fully believe PART can eventually become as such once the adoption of the Particl platform grows.</p><p>As part of this vision, we are working on a cross-chain and private decentralized trading exchange (BasicSwap DEX) that lets you swap different cryptocurrencies without the use of any third-party.</p><p>That means you can easily enter and exit the Particl ecosystem using your favorite privacy coin such as Monero, for example, and enjoy the benefits of both chains at the same time. </p><p>By combining Monero's private-by-default currency-focused approach and Particl's app-focused vision, you can reach strong levels of privacy few people thought were possible. The trade-offs of using an opt-in privacy coin (Particl) can then be offset by using an opt-out one (Monero) on the platform, just like Monero can offset its trade-offs (lack of distributed apps and more rigidity) by bridging into the Particl ecosystem using BasicSwap. A win-win situation for both blockchains and a major victory for the people.</p><p>Once the DEX is integrated into Particl desktop client, Particl Desktop, the synergy it creates with other privacy coins will take the entire privacy enthusiast community to the next level. You'll be able to use distributed and private applications without making any security or privacy compromise and by using your favorite coin.</p><p>Indeed, synergy, not tribalism, is how we see the privacy coin space evolving to the direct benefit of the people. There are many different approaches to privacy and it’s difficult to say which one is the best because, in part, use-cases and target audiences differ so much. And so, why not combine different options and work in unison towards bringing more privacy to the average joe? That's what we set out to do with Particl, and what we'll keep giving our blood, sweat, and tears to day after day!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr>\n<h3 id=\"join-the-discussion\">Join the discussion</h3>\n<p>What's your stance?

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively targeting transformation into hard money.</strong></p><p>At present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget generated by:</p><ul><li>Network transaction fees</li><li>New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).</li></ul><p>Staking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active circulation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new tokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens minted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases - rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by<br>new token issuance (supply inflation).</p><p>In many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism of asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes that we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token for yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked will either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network grows.</p><p>Staking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not actively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity. Staking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value of circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however paradoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are essentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity that brings intrinsic value<br>to the network.</p><p>So if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed towards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully transform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?</p><p>Simple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the frequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively reducing new token issuance.</p><p>Fortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key applications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:</p><h3 id=\"basicswapdex-bsx-\">BasicSwapDex (BSX)</h3><ul><li>Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​</li><li>​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third party<br>integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap) with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</h3><ul><li>Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds utilised in purchasing goods and services.​</li><li>​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.</li></ul><p><strong>In any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development team and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl network otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time.</strong> They are effectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual supply inflation reward decreases.</p><p>I note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation rate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that result in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft currency.</p><p><strong>It is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus on increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability</strong> to create an L1 system whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to adequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful in that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with additional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money<br>than traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other cryptocurrencies currently traded today.</p><p>Regardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community is active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to further propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to 0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency funded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that satisfies my definition of “hard money”.</p><h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2><ul><li>Voting opens: Est.

This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively targeting transformation into hard money.</strong></p><p>At present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget generated by:</p><ul><li>Network transaction fees</li><li>New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).</li></ul><p>Staking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active circulation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new tokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens minted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases - rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by<br>new token issuance (supply inflation).</p><p>In many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism of asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes that we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token for yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked will either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network grows.</p><p>Staking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not actively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity. Staking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value of circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however paradoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are essentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity that brings intrinsic value<br>to the network.</p><p>So if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed towards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully transform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?</p><p>Simple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the frequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively reducing new token issuance.</p><p>Fortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key applications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:</p><h3 id=\"basicswapdex-bsx-\">BasicSwapDex (BSX)</h3><ul><li>Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​</li><li>​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third party<br>integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap) with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</h3><ul><li>Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds utilised in purchasing goods and services.​</li><li>​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.</li></ul><p><strong>In any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development team and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl network otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time.</strong> They are effectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual supply inflation reward decreases.</p><p>I note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation rate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that result in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft currency.</p><p><strong>It is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus on increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability</strong> to create an L1 system whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to adequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful in that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with additional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money<br>than traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other cryptocurrencies currently traded today.</p><p>Regardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community is active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to further propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to 0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency funded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that satisfies my definition of “hard money”.</p><h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2><ul><li>Voting opens: Est.
