If\nyou run a cold staking node, update it immediately by typing out this command: \npartyman update.

Do not make any transaction using any of\nthe older, pre-fork Particl Core versions as they will not show up after\nupdating your node. The Particl team is already working in collaboration with\nexchanges and partners (i.e. cold staking pool and Particl Copay operators)\nwhich have already updated their Particl Core nodes to the right version.\n\nWe understand that you may have questions out of this sudden and unexpected\nannouncement. We are here to help and answer your questions! We will follow up,\nin the next few days, with a blog post explaining exactly the nature of the\ndetected vulnerability, what led to its discovery, its impact, and the way\nforward post-hardfork. For maximum transparency, the Particl team will also open\nup, at the same time, an AMA thread on Particl’s sub-Reddit to answer any of\nyour questions about the event.

This\nannouncement will disclose the nature of the vulnerability and provide\npreliminary details surrounding the event.\n\nEmergency Hard Fork AnnouncementThe Particl team has found a critical issue in\nthe RingCT and CT code which requires a hardfork. Please update your Particl\nCore nodes immediately.cryptoguardBlog\n[https://particl.news/emergency-hardfork-announcement/]Above all, if you haven’t\nalready done so, please urgently download the new Particl Core (Particl Core\n0.19.2.5 [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.5])\nclient which can be found here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.5]. If you run a\ncold staking node, please update it immediately by typing the partyman update \ncommand. If you use the Particl Desktop client, launch it as soon as possible so\nthat it can automatically be updated with the new Particl Core version. If it's\nalready opened up, please shut it down completely and restart it.\n\n> Note: Trading on exchanges will be safe to resume after updating their nodes to\nParticl Core 0.19.2.5.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Contents\n * What Happened?\n * How Did This Happen?\n * The Solution\n * Investigating the Attack\n * FAQ and our Commitment to Transparency\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat Happened?\nOn the 20th of February, 2021, a significant discrepancy between the expected\nand real supply of Particl was observed and confirmed. This prompted the team to\nhastily look into the source of this discrepancy, which led to the discovery of\na critical vulnerability that allowed coins to be anonymously created by\ndefeating the verification code of plain-to-anon transactions. It can be\nconfirmed that this vulnerability has been exploited by a malicious party which\nled to the creation of an unknown number of anon coins. It can also be confirmed\nthat at least 768,767 exploited PART coins have been successfully transferred\nfrom anon to public balances since the beginning of the attack, according to\ntraces on the blockchain.\n\nThe vulnerability is now fully fixed and cannot be exploited anymore as of the\nrelease of Particl Core 0.19.2.4.\n\nHow Did This Happen?\nUnderstanding the vulnerability requires one to be aware of the two issues in\nthe code which led to it.\n\nThe first and main issue is located in the verification code of plain-to-anon\ntransactions. It caused the commitment sum not to verify when sending coins from\npublic balances to anon ones. This means an attacker can pick his own made-up\noutput values, which aren’t required to sum to the amount of the inputs used.\nThis vulnerability was located here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/cb12ae91f6a84df44e2aa0e73780fee5085491ac/src/consensus/tx_verify.cpp#L342] \nin Particl’s code and has now been patched.\n\nAdditionally, a related issue was discovered that prevented the blind sum from\nbeing set when sending PART coins from public to anon balances. This means that\nall public to anon values would fail the commitment sum check even if their\ninputs and outputs summed. For this reason, it isn't easy to determine, with\nabsolute certainty, which RingCT transactions were exploited and which ones are\nlegitimate. In this case, any anon output or blinded output descending from an\nanon output could, in theory, be holding millions of illegitimate PART coins.\nThis vulnerability is located here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/cb12ae91f6a84df44e2aa0e73780fee5085491ac/src/wallet/hdwallet.cpp#L3836] \nin Particl’s code and has been patched as well.\n\nAt the time of this writing, and since July 2019, it is confirmed that at least\n768,767 exploited PART coins have been successfully transferred from anon\nbalances to public ones. As per the nature of the RingCT privacy protocol, it is\nunclear exactly how many anon coins were created in total or remain in anon\noutputs. Still, the Particl team is continuing its investigation. Any additional\ncoin added to this estimate would be the total number of legitimate PART coins\nthe community holds in anon balances.\n\nBe assured; the Particl team is in the process of determining the new supply and\npreventing any remaining exploited coins from being transacted. Once the\ninvestigation concludes, the total circulating supply of Particl will be\nadjusted to its new, post-inflationary bug value with full certainty,\neffectively restoring the chain’s integrity.\n\n> Note: Although the protocol, cryptography, and libraries of the RingCT and\nBulletproofs protocols have been thoroughly audited by the renowned Quarkslab\nsecurity firm, the specific portion of the code that was exploited, which is its\nimplementation, didn’t fall under the scope of their audit or mandate.\nThe Solution\nThe solution to address this attack and restore the blockchain’s integrity can\nbe separated into two specific objectives.\n\n * Fix the vulnerability to prevent exploited coins from being created and\n   transacted. (SUCCESS)\n * Re-enable anon and blind transactions but permanently block exploited anon\n   coins (IN PROGRESS)\n\nTo complete both of these objectives, the Particl team has pushed forward a\ncontingency plan that requires two hardforks.\n\nHardfork 1\nThe first hardfork, which has been successful already, fixed the vulnerabilities\nto prevent more coins from being created. It also temporarily disabled RingCT\nand CT transactions on the Particl network, preventing anon and blind coins from\nbeing transacted. This made it impossible for the attacker to convert more\nexploited anon coins into public balances, effectively putting a full stop to\nthe attack.\n\nThe new client to make this hardfork happen (Particl Core 0.19.2.4\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.4]) has already\nbeen pushed out publicly, but a new version (Particl Core 0.19.2.5\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.5]) has been\nreleased a few days after. Particl Core 0.19.2.5 introduces a checksum mark\npreventing any rollbacks and permanently invalidating the old chain to get ready\nfor the second hardfork.\n\nIf you haven't updated yet, it is essential that you immediately do so by\ninstalling the new Particl Core version\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.5] or, at the very\nleast, the 0.19.2.4 version.\n\nHardfork 2\nThe second hardfork aims at restoring full RingCT and CT functionalities as well\nas restoring the integrity of the chain by disallowing exploited anon outputs\nfrom being used in the future but allowing legitimate ones. The conclusion of\nthe second hardfork will also confirm the newly adjusted supply of the Particl\nblockchain and adjust it to its true post-inflation value.\n\nOnce this hardfork is completed, it will let you privately transact with other\npeople once again, including when using the Particl Marketplace. To ensure that\nno exploited coins can be used post-hardfork, all the anon and blind outputs\noriginating from before the hardfork will be frozen. It’ll then be possible for\nlegitimate users to unfreeze them by going through a series of manual steps to\nprove their legitimacy.\n\nThe Particl team is currently evaluating various strategies to “whitelist” these\nlegitimate outputs while keeping exploited ones unusable. These strategies vary\nin impact, intrusiveness, and level of complexities, but each has its pros and\ncons.\n\nWhile they are not yet ready to be announced, the team will present to the\ncommunity its game plan as soon as possible. We would like to request additional\ntime to ensure all the necessary data is collected and that the strategies are\nas efficient as they can be. Thank you for your patience and support!\n\n> Note: The second hardfork will also include a few other minor improvements and\nchanges the team had been looking into adding for a while now, some being\nunrelated to this particular exploit event. The full changelog will be available\non the new client’s Github release page.\n> Note 2: The second hardfork will reveal the new inflated supply of the Particl\nblockchain. As a side effect, please take note that this will cause staking\nrewards to increase proportionally to how much the circulating supply has\ninflated.\nInvestigating the Attack\nSince the day of the hardfork, the Particl team has been collecting data and\ncollaborating with exchanges to determine whether the attacker can be identified\nand whether he still holds coins on there. However, due to the nature of RingCT,\nit may be impossible, with total certainty, to come to definitive conclusions.\nIn any case, the investigation continues, but the findings can not yet be\ndisclosed publicly. We will keep you informed as soon as possible.\n\nIf you believe that you’ve tracked suspicious activity on the blockchain, you\ncan submit your findings to Cryptoguard, which will then relay the information\nto the rest of the team for the investigation. We appreciate every bit of help\nand would like to thank everyone who participates in this effort.\n\n> Note: Trading on exchanges will be safe to resume after updating their nodes to\nParticl Core 0.19.2.5.\nFAQ and our Commitment to Transparency\nWe understand that you may have questions related to this announcement; we are\nhere to help! The Particl team is committed to full transparency and user\nsupport through this evolving situation. \n\nTo that end, we will publish a follow-up blog post later on that will contain\nmore data and up-to-date information about the attack as we gather it.\n\nFrom that point, the team will then hold an FAQ session on our sub-Reddit to\nanswer any remaining questions. Cryptoguard will be available for answers with\nsupport from the Particl Core developers. This thread will be pinned on\nParticl's sub-Reddit and serve as the go-to FAQ resource for people with\nquestions about this event.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank You!\nWe want to thank you for your support and patience as we work on collecting more\ndata, preparing for the second hardfork, and building the tools required to\nvalidate legitimate anon outputs.

This prompted the team to hastily look into the source of this discrepancy, which led to the discovery of a critical vulnerability that allowed coins to be anonymously created by defeating the verification code of plain-to-anon transactions. It can be confirmed that this vulnerability has been exploited by a malicious party which led to the creation of an unknown number of anon coins. <strong>It can also be confirmed that at least 768,767 exploited PART coins have been successfully transferred from anon to public balances since the beginning of the attack</strong>, according to traces on the blockchain.</p><p>The vulnerability is now fully fixed and cannot be exploited anymore as of the release of Particl Core 0.19.2.4.</p><h1 id=\"how-did-this-happen\">How Did This Happen?</h1><p>Understanding the vulnerability requires one to be aware of the two issues in the code which led to it.</p><p>The first and main issue is located in the verification code of plain-to-anon transactions. <strong>It caused the commitment sum not to verify when sending coins from public balances to anon ones</strong>. This means an attacker can pick his own made-up output values, which aren’t required to sum to the amount of the inputs used. This vulnerability was located <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/cb12ae91f6a84df44e2aa0e73780fee5085491ac/src/consensus/tx_verify.cpp#L342\"><strong>here</strong></a> in Particl’s code and has now been patched.</p><p>Additionally, a related issue was discovered that <strong>prevented the blind sum from being set when sending PART coins from public to anon balances</strong>. This means that all public to anon values would fail the commitment sum check even if their inputs and outputs summed. For this reason, it isn't easy to determine, with absolute certainty, which RingCT transactions were exploited and which ones are legitimate. In this case, any anon output or blinded output descending from an anon output could, in theory, be holding millions of illegitimate PART coins. This vulnerability is located <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/cb12ae91f6a84df44e2aa0e73780fee5085491ac/src/wallet/hdwallet.cpp#L3836\"><strong>here</strong></a> in Particl’s code and has been patched as well.</p><p>At the time of this writing, and since July 2019, it is confirmed that <strong>at least 768,767 exploited PART coins have been successfully transferred from anon balances to public ones</strong>. As per the nature of the RingCT privacy protocol, it is unclear exactly how many anon coins were created in total or remain in anon outputs. Still, the Particl team is continuing its investigation. <strong><strong>Any additional coin added to this estimate would be the total number of</strong> legitimate<strong> PART coins the community holds in anon balances.</strong></strong></p><p>Be assured; the Particl team is in the process of determining the new supply and preventing any remaining exploited coins from being transacted. Once the investigation concludes, the total circulating supply of Particl will be adjusted to its new, post-inflationary bug value with full certainty, effectively restoring the chain’s integrity.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> Although the protocol, cryptography, and libraries of the RingCT and Bulletproofs protocols have been thoroughly audited by the renowned Quarkslab security firm, the specific portion of the code that was exploited, which is its implementation, didn’t fall under the scope of their audit or mandate.</em></blockquote><h1 id=\"the-solution\">The Solution</h1><p>The solution to address this attack and restore the blockchain’s integrity can be separated into two specific objectives.</p><ul><li>Fix the vulnerability to prevent exploited coins from being created and transacted. (SUCCESS)</li><li>Re-enable anon and blind transactions but permanently block exploited anon coins (IN PROGRESS)</li></ul><p>To complete both of these objectives, the Particl team has pushed forward a contingency plan that requires two hardforks.</p><h3 id=\"hardfork-1\">Hardfork 1</h3><p>The first hardfork, which has been successful already, <strong>fixed the vulnerabilities to prevent more coins from being created. It also temporarily disabled RingCT and CT transactions</strong> on the Particl network, preventing anon and blind coins from being transacted. This made it impossible for the attacker to convert more exploited anon coins into public balances, effectively putting a full stop to the attack.</p><p>The new client to make this hardfork happen (<strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.4\">Particl Core 0.19.2.4</a></strong>) has already been pushed out publicly, but a new version (<strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.5\">Particl Core 0.19.2.5</a></strong>) has been released a few days after. Particl Core 0.19.2.5 introduces a checksum mark preventing any rollbacks and permanently invalidating the old chain to get ready for the second hardfork.</p><p>If you haven't updated yet, it is essential that you immediately do so by installing <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.5\"><strong>the new Particl Core version</strong></a><strong> </strong>or, at the very least, the 0.19.2.4 version.</p><h3 id=\"hardfork-2\">Hardfork 2</h3><p>The second hardfork aims at <strong>restoring full RingCT and CT functionalities</strong> as well as restoring the integrity of the chain by <strong>disallowing exploited anon outputs from being used in the future but allowing legitimate ones</strong>. The conclusion of the second hardfork will also confirm the newly adjusted supply of the Particl blockchain and adjust it to its true post-inflation value.</p><p>Once this hardfork is completed, it will let you privately transact with other people once again, including when using the Particl Marketplace. To ensure that no exploited coins can be used post-hardfork, all the anon and blind outputs originating from before the hardfork will be frozen. It’ll then be possible for legitimate users to unfreeze them by going through a series of manual steps to prove their legitimacy.</p><p>The Particl team is currently evaluating various strategies to “whitelist” these legitimate outputs while keeping exploited ones unusable. These strategies vary in impact, intrusiveness, and level of complexities, but each has its pros and cons.</p><p>While they are not yet ready to be announced, the team will present to the community its game plan as soon as possible. We would like to request additional time to ensure all the necessary data is collected and that the strategies are as efficient as they can be. Thank you for your patience and support!</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> The second hardfork will also include a few other minor improvements and changes the team had been looking into adding for a while now, some being unrelated to this particular exploit event. The full changelog will be available on the new client’s Github release page.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em><strong>Note 2:</strong> The second hardfork will reveal the new inflated supply of the Particl blockchain. As a side effect, please take note that this will cause staking rewards to increase proportionally to how much the circulating supply has inflated.</em></blockquote><h1 id=\"investigating-the-attack\">Investigating the Attack</h1><p>Since the day of the hardfork, the Particl team has been collecting data and collaborating with exchanges to determine whether the attacker can be identified and whether he still holds coins on there. However, due to the nature of RingCT, it may be impossible, with total certainty, to come to definitive conclusions. In any case, the investigation continues, but the findings can not yet be disclosed publicly. We will keep you informed as soon as possible.</p><p>If you believe that you’ve tracked suspicious activity on the blockchain, you can submit your findings to Cryptoguard, which will then relay the information to the rest of the team for the investigation. We appreciate every bit of help and would like to thank everyone who participates in this effort.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> Trading on exchanges will be safe to resume after updating their nodes to Particl Core 0.19.2.5.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"faq-and-our-commitment-to-transparency\">FAQ and our Commitment to Transparency</h2><p>We understand that you may have questions related to this announcement; we are here to help! The Particl team is committed to full transparency and user support through this evolving situation. </p><p>To that end, we will publish a follow-up blog post later on that will contain more data and up-to-date information about the attack as we gather it.</p><p>From that point, the team will then hold an FAQ session on our sub-Reddit to answer any remaining questions. Cryptoguard will be available for answers with support from the Particl Core developers. This thread will be pinned on Particl's sub-Reddit and serve as the go-to FAQ resource for people with questions about this event.</p><hr><h2 id=\"thank-you-\">Thank You!</h2><p>We want to thank you for your support and patience as we work on collecting more data, preparing for the second hardfork, and building the tools required to validate legitimate anon outputs.

Obwohl es nicht unendlich viele Neuigkeiten gibt, und\nsich unsere Entwickler während der Weihnachtstage eine wohlverdiente Pause\ngenommen haben, können wir dennoch in verschiedenen Bereichen wesentliche\nFortschritte verzeichnen.\n\nKommen wir also gleich zur Sache!\n\nParticl Core: Neue Versionen sind veröffentlicht\nWie bereits kürzlich erwähnt, hat Tecnovert, unser Particl Core Entwickler, die\nSchlagzahl in verschiedenen Bereichen erhöht, sodass insbesondere Particl Core\nwieder auf den neuesten Stand der Bitcoin Codebasis gebracht werden konnte. In\nden kommenden Monaten könnt Ihr deshalb mit weiteren wichtigen Aktualisierungen\nund neuen Features rund um Particl Core rechnen.\n\nIn diesem Kontext wurden diesen Monat bereits zwei neue Core Versionen als\nVorabveröffentlichung (pre-release) zur Testphase freigegeben; zum einen Particl\nCore 0.19.2.3 und zum anderen Particl Core 0.21.0.1.\n\nHeute, am 28. Januar 2021, konnte Particl Core 0.19.2.3 vollständig\nveröffentlicht werden und verliert hiermit seinen Status als\nVorabveröffentlichung (pre-release).\n\nParticl Core 0.19.2.3\n * Download: https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.3\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.3]\n\nDie neue Particl Core Version 0.19.2.3 besteht im Wesentlichen aus kleinen\nFehlerbehebungen (bug fixes) und Verbesserungen. Daneben führen wir wieder eine\n32-Bit-Version für Windows ein, die von Bitcoin Core gänzlich gestrichen wurde.\nParticl kann damit theoretisch eine höhere Reichweite seiner Nutzerbasis\nermöglichen, da weniger leistungsstarke oder schlicht ältere Computer weiterhin\nin der Lage sind, Particl Core und den Particl Marktplatz, zu nutzen.\n\nDas komplette Changelog setzt sich wie folgt zusammen:\n\n * Bitcoin 0.19.2 Backports gemerged.\n * Neue PoW Checkpoints.\n * smsginbox Hex Encoding Bug wurde gefixt.\n * IsStandard() Prüfung auf fehlgeschlagene nachrangige Skripts verbessert.\n * Win32 Gitian Builds wieder eingeführt.\n\nParticl Core 0.21.0.1\n * Download: https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.0.1\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.0.1]\n\nParticl Core 0.21.0.1 stellt ein deutlich komplexere Aktualisierung als 0.19.2.3\ndar. Es handelt sich hierbei um die erste bedeutende Particl Core Aktualisierung\nseit dem 4. Dezember 2019 und enthält eine enorme Anzahl an Verbesserungen, die\nvon Bitcoin Core 0.20 und 0.21 abgeleitet sind. In der Folge sollen die\nWichtigsten vorgestellt werden.\n\n * Neuer RPC-Aufruf zum einfachen Erstellen und Freigeben eines sicheren\n   Blockchain-Snapshots, der die Blockchain nutzbar macht, während sie noch\n   nicht vollständig synchronisiert ist.\n * Asmap Funktion\n   [https://cryptooof.com/bitcoin-core-brings-asmap-as-an-antidote-to-erebus-attack/] \n   um die dezentralen Netzwerkverbindungen zuverlässiger zu machen.\n * Tor V3 support\n   [https://decrypt.co/44640/bitcoins-next-upgrade-will-support-tor-v3-addresses] \n   für besseren Datenschutz im Netzwerk. Tor wird V2-Adressen in den nächsten\n   ein bis zwei Jahren auslaufen lassen, was dies zu einem kritischen Update für\n   Particl Core macht.\n * Schnorr signatures\n   [https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/the-power-of-schnorr-the-signature-algorithm-to-increase-bitcoin-s-scale-and-privacy-1460642496] \n    und Taproot\n   [https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/taproot-coming-what-it-and-how-it-will-benefit-bitcoin] \n    Bereitstellung für mehr Datenschutz und Skalierbarkeit. Dies muss jedoch\n   noch aktiviert werden, aber der Particl Core ist dafür bereit.\n * Keine \"Default\" Wallet automatisch erstellen wenn Particl Core zum ersten mal\n   gestartet wird.\n * \"Kompakte clientseitige Blockfilter\" für datenschutzfreundlichere Light\n   Wallets.\n * Verschiedene Problem- und Fehlerbehebungen sowie allgemeine Verbesserungen\n   der Hintergrunddienste.\n\nParticl Core 0.21.0.1 ist als Vorabveröffentlichung (pre-release)\nveröffentlicht, sodass die kommenden Tage und Wochen dazu genutzt werden sollen,\ndas Update auf Herz und Nieren zu prüfen, bevor es vollständig veröffentlicht\nwird.\n\nDieser Vorgang ist eine feste Tradition und soll sicherstellen, dass sowohl\nStabilität als auch Sicherheit von Particl Core den allerhöchsten Standards\nentsprechen. Sobald Particl Core 0.21.0.1 vollständig veröffentlicht wurde, wird\nes Particl Core 0.19.2.3 ablösen.\n\nEtwaige Probleme, die Ihr hinsichtlich Particl Core 0.21.0.1 feststellt, meldet\ndirekt via Github Issues [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues].\n\nParticl V3\nParticl V3, das sowohl unsere neue Desktop-Anwendung als auch die verbesserte\nMarktplatz Codebasis beinhaltet, macht gute Fortschritte. Im Moment konzentriert\nsich unser Fokus zuvorderst auf zwei verschiedene Bereiche.\n\n * Behebung von kleineren Problemen, die während der ersten Testphase seitens\n   der Community gefunden wurden.\n * Behebung eines umfangreichen Problems, das den Start der Anwendung auf\n   Windows für manche Nutzer verhindert\n\nObwohl wir davon ausgehen, dass die kleineren Probleme schnell gelöst werden\nkönnen, handelt es sich bei dem im Zusammenhang mit Windows festgestellten\nProblem, um einen vergleichsweise zeitintensiven Arbeitsaufwand. Eine neue\nTestnet-Version von Particl V3 wird voraussichtlich in Kürze veröffentlicht\nwerden, die jedoch die Problembehebung des beschriebenen Problems für Windows\nnoch nicht beinhalten wird.\n\nDiese Phase sollte deshalb genutzt werden, um die neue Version zu testen, und\ndabei sicherzustellen, dass keine neuen Probleme als Ergebnis der letzten\nFehlerbehebungen entstanden sind. Sobald das beschriebene Problem im\nZusammenhang mit Windows gelöst ist, wird im Anschluss eine letzte\nTestnet-Version veröffentlicht. Sollte in diesem Zusammehang kein weiteres\nProblem entstehen, ist Particl V3 bereit, um als Mainnet-Version veröffentlich\nzu werden.\n\nParticl Acadamy\nDie Particl Acadamy steht kurz vor der Fertigstellung und wird noch vor dem\noffiziellen Start von Particl V3 das Licht der Welt erblicken. Ihr könnt euch\ndarauf verlassen, dass wir unseren Wurzeln treu bleiben und die gesamte Acadamy\nals quelloffene (open-sourced) Plattform auf Github stellen werden. Dieser\nSchritt ermöglicht es der gesamten Community, sich inhaltlich einzubringen,\nÄnderungen vorzuschlagen und aktiv an Verbesserungen mitzuarbeiten.\n\nCCS System\nEs gibt zwei wichtige Themen, die wir im Bezug auf das CCS Proposal System\nhervorheben möchten.\n\nErstens wurde ein umfangreiches Proposal veröffentlicht, dass bereits nach knapp\neinem Monat rund 65% seines Zielwertes mit insgesamt 29 Beitragszahlern erreicht\nhat! Das zentrale Anliegen des Proposals besteht darin, den Marktplatz mit\ntausenden Artikeln zu füttern, die völlig anonym gekauft werden können. Der\ngesamte Kaufprozess wird im Hintergrund automatisiert ablaufen und folglich eine\nangenehme und unkomplizierte User Experience (Benutzererfahrung) ermöglichen.\n\nFolgt diesem Link\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html], um die\nInitiative finanziell zu unterstützen.\n\nSeeding Items to the MarketplaceLudx and Cryptoguard\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html]Zweitens\nhat das Particl Team damit begonnen, die Grundlagen zu schaffen, um das neue\nOn-Chain-Wahlverfahren als Teil des CCS Systems zu integrieren. Das wird\nMitglieder unserer Community in die Lage versetzen, eigenständig Vorschläge\n(Proposals) zu formulieren und zu einer Abstimmung zu bringen, um bei Fragen\nrund um tiefgreifende Protokolländerungen oder anderen strategischen Themen,\neinen Konsens herzustellen.\n\nWeitere Informationen hinsichtlich der Frage, wann und unter welchen Bedingungen\nein Konsens hergestellt wird, soll in Kürze mit allgemeinen Aspekten rund um das\nOn-Chain-Wahlverfahren sowie ein Zeitplan (E.T.A.) bis zur Veröffentlichung\nkommuniziert werden.\n\nParticl.News Übersetzungen\nBereits vor einiger Zeit haben verschiedene Mitglieder der Community damit\nbegonnen, zentrale Blogartikel in ihre Muttersprache zu übersetzen. Aufgrund der\nlimitierten Möglichkeiten, die Medium für das Anzeigen verschiedener Sprachen\nanbietet, haben wir uns entschieden, Particl.News in Zukunft mit Ghost zu\nerstellen.\n\nÜbersetzungen und alle anderen Artikel werden von nun an auf Particl News\n[https://particl.news/] publiziert! Die Übersetzungen werden jedoch nicht\nstandardmäßig angezeigt und müssen über die jeweiligen Landesflaggen in der\nrechten oberen Ecke gesondert angewählt werden.\n\nÜbersetzungen sind eine besonders wichtige Hilfe dabei, Particl einer weltweiten\nÖffentlichkeit vorzustellen und zugänglich zu machen. Wir möchten insofern allen\nUnterstützern, die an den Übersetzungen arbeiten, unseren Dank aussprechen. Dies\nsind: WhiteFlag (Spanisch), Laurogripa (Portugiesisch), Mbacoinin and Stock999 \n(Russisch), Anonymouser (Filipino) und t0ph3r (Deutsch)!\n\nSolltest du ebenfalls Lust bekommen, Particl zu unterstützen und weitere\nBlogartikel in deine Muttersprache zu übersetzen, melde dich direkt über Discord\noder Telegram bei uns und wir werden gemeinsam ausloten, welche Artikel dringend\nübersetzt werden müssen, und publizieren diese dann auf Particl News\n[https://particl.news/].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl braucht DICH!\nWir befinden uns kurz vor dem Beginn der zweiten Testphase von Particl V3 und\nsetzen auf eure Unterstützung. Haltet euch also bereit, damit wir diese letzten\nTests nutzen, um eine schnellen und sicheren Start auf dem Mainnet\nsicherzustellen.\n\nIn der Zwischenzeit möchten wir euch einladen, Particl Core 0.21.0.1 ausgiebig\nzu testen. Idealerweise sollten dabei verschiedene Betriebssysteme und\nHardware-Setups überprüft werden. Dies ermöglicht es, Probleme schneller\naufzuspüren und folglich umso schneller voranzuschreiten.\n\nAbschliessend möchten wir euch für den andauernden Support danken. Lasst uns\n2021 zu einem großartigen Jahr für Particl und allgemein für die Welt\ndezentraler E-Commerce-Lösungen werden!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl ist Partizipieren\nSei ein Kümmerer.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model.

the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
