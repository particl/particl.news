Due to changes in the data structure of\nBasicSwap-related SMSG messages, previous instances of the DEX are not\nforward-compatible with this new version. This means that offers posted from\nupdated instances will not appear on older instances. All users must update to\nmaintain full network connectivity.\nAfter 171 commits over 164 files changed coming from 6 different contributors\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/compare/v0.14.3...v0.14.4], we are\nexcited to announce the release of a significant BasicSwap update (v0.14.4)\nalong with an update to its user interface, now at version 3.2.1.\n\nThis substantial update represents weeks of dedicated effort, incorporating\nnumerous improvements, bug fixes, new features, and significant refactors of\ndifferent core components of the system. The changes stem from extensive testing\nby both contributors and community members, resulting in a significant step\nforward for user experience and platform stability.\n\nNoteworthy Updates ?\nWhile this update is massive in scope, many changes are backend changes to\nimprove efficiency, stability, and cross-compatibility. However, several\nsignificant user experience enhancements are worth highlighting.\n\nVarious Coin Core Updates ✅\nWe've made several updates to the various coins available on BasicSwap DEX.\nWhether these updates involve new core versions or integration improvements, we\nhighly recommend updating your node versions as soon as possible.\n\nSignificant UI Refactor ?️\nA major refactoring of the user interface code has occurred over the last couple\nof weeks. While these changes primarily involve code organization and better\npractices that aren't immediately apparent to end users, we've also implemented\nnumerous UI upgrades, including:\n\n * Local reputation tracking\n * Enhanced order book formatting with additional information\n * New Bids page\n * Improved Swaps in Progress page\n * Better Offer pages\n * More responsive and dynamic page behavior\n * Better rate fetching\n * Much more...\n\nThe interface changes since our last version (v0.14.4) are substantial, and\nyou'll miss out on many new features and improvements if you don't update.\n\nClient Authentication ?\nWe've added the ability to configure your BasicSwap instance with client\nauthentication. This feature protects both the webUI and API port access with a\npassword of your choosing. \n\nThis is vital if you're running BasicSwap on a cloud server or using the\nmarket-making companion script in a network environment you don't completely\ntrust. To set up client authentication, please refer to the installation\ndocumentation.\n\nMulti-Net Support ?\nWe've pushed to master the preliminary code for upcoming multi network support\nfor BasicSwap. We've deployed the first phase of a significant infrastructure\nupdate to our networking architecture. This new feature, currently called\n\"multi-net,\" enables BasicSwap to distribute swap, offer, and bid messages\nacross multiple messaging networks beyond SMSG when the primary network\nexperiences high load.\n\nSince all messages adhere to a unified encryption and formatting standard, even\nnon-decentralized networks (such as Telegram or email) could be utilized without\ncompromising user privacy or security.\n\nThis new functionality delivers several key benefits:\n\n 1. Improved platform scalability and resilience\n 2. Greater flexibility for third-party integrations, allowing partners to use\n    their preferred compatible networks for message relay\n 3. Cross-network message compatibility, eliminating the need for users to\n    operate on the same network during swaps\n\nWhile the foundation is now in place, further development is still needed before\nthe implementation becomes fully usable. The current proof of concept using\nSimplex broadcasts messages to the entire group rather than targeting specific\nrecipients — an inefficiency we're addressing given Simplex's limitations.\n\nThe core architecture is designed to extend SMSG functionality across various\nnetworks. All messages maintain SMSG encryption and message IDs for consistency,\nalthough additional work is required to ensure full compatibility of Python SMSG\nmessages across all networks and to add convenience functions for submitting\npre-formed SMSG messages. Currently, this new system pushes to the core through\nP2P connections (for SMSG testing) but doesn't yet join the SMSG and Simplex\nnetworks.\n\nNot to be overlooked is the important advantage of this approach in its\nflexibility regarding network requirements. Since messages are (or will be)\nfully valid SMSG entities, they can be transmitted over plaintext networks like\nTelegram, Delta, or even Pastebin. Email systems supporting POP3/IMAP protocols\nare particularly well-suited for more decentralization-focused users. It's worth\nnoting that centralized options, including Simplex, may still expose some\ninformation pseudonymously about which accounts are communicating with each\nother.\n\nAcceptance Strategy Knowledge ?\nWhen publishing a new offer, the SMSG messages relaying its details to the rest\nof the network now carry information about whether the offer is set to\nautomatically accept bids. This information is also displayed on an offer's page\nbefore submitting a bid, helping you make better-informed decisions about which\noffers to bid on.\n\nPlease note that this change means previous instances of BasicSwap will not be\nable to properly resolve offer messages from up-to-date instances. Updating your\nBasicSwap instance is mandatory to receive all offers from the network. However,\noffer messages from older instances remain compatible with the new version, so\nupgrading now carries no downside.\n\nDocs ?️\nWe've migrated BasicSwap's documentation from the Particl Academy (which uses\nReadTheDocs) to a more maintainable and flexible platform (Docusaurus) at \ndocs.basicswapdex.com [https://docs.basicswapdex.com/docs/intro/]. While we'll\nmaintain the BasicSwap documentation on the Particl Academy, all new updates\nwill be provided at the new location.\n\nInstall the Latest BasicSwap Update ?️\nDue to a significant change in what data is carried in BasicSwap-related\nmessages, it is mandatory to update the DEX. Failure to do so will result in\nyour instance not picking up messages from up-to-date instances.\n\nTo install the new update, which includes both the codebase and user interface\nupdates, simply update BasicSwap through the usual process\n[https://docs.basicswapdex.com/docs/user-guides/update] (video walkthrough\n[https://youtu.be/obxcmEby64s?si=-kFNfEIJx8yQYJhP]) and launch the DEX again.\n\nDocker\n> If you've installed BasicSwap following the Docker method...\n * Shutdown BasicSwap properly and stop the Docker image (docker-compose stop),\n * From the basicswap folder, type the git pull command,\n * In the /docker folder, run the docker-compose build --no-cache command,\n * Once the process completes, launch BasicSwap again using the docker-compose\n   up command.\n\n> Note: Depending on your Docker version, adding a dash between docker and compose \nmay not be necessary and may instead throw an error.\nNon-Docker\n> If you've installed BasicSwap following the non-Docker method...\n * Shutdown BasicSwap properly,\n * From the ~/coinswaps/basicswap folder, type the git pull command,\n * Execute the following command: pip install --require-hashes -r\n   requirements.txt,\n * Execute the following command: pip3 install .,\n * Launch BasicSwap as usual.\n\nInstall Script\n> If you've installed BasicSwap using Nahuhh's Github installation script\n[https://github.com/nahuhh/basicswap-bash/]...\n * Execute the update command: bsx-update && bsx-update.\n\nChangelog ?\nCoin(s)\n * Bitcoin — Added support for Bitcoin descriptor wallets\n * Bitcoin — Update Bitcoins' fast sync blockchain file\n * Bitcoin — Add a workaround to prevent Bitcoin wallets' seeds changing after\n   enabling encryption\n * Bitcoin Cash — Upgraded Bitcoin Cash node to version 28.0.1\n * Bitcoin Cash — Refresh BCH keypool\n * Monero — Upgrade Monero node to version 0.18.4.0\n * Monero — Corrupt Monero wallets are now detected\n * Monero — Remove inaccurate fee rates for Monero and hide sweep all checkbox\n * Monero — Make Monero's fork height a transient error\n * Monero — Sets Monero's trusted_daemon setting to true by default\n * Litecoin — Fixed a bug with MWEB wallet generation\n * PIVX — Fixed issues with PIVX\n * Namecoin — Large array of fixes and improvements to the Namecoin integration\n * Wownero — Fixed Wownero's Windows download URL\n * Fixed a reseed wallet regression error\n\nAPI\n * Better handling of errors with the API\n * Fixed bug with Firo's API\n * Simplified API requests\n * Identities API updated\n * Use CryptoCompare pricemulti endpoint for multiple coins\n * Reduced lookupFiatRates debug message\n\nUI Code\n * Fixed various memory leaks and improved memory efficiency\n * Major UI refactor;

The changes stem from extensive testing by both contributors and community members, resulting in a significant step forward for user experience and platform stability.</p><h2 id=\"noteworthy-updates-\">Noteworthy Updates ?</h2><p>While this update is massive in scope, many changes are backend changes to improve efficiency, stability, and cross-compatibility. However, several significant user experience enhancements are worth highlighting.</p><h3 id=\"various-coin-core-updates-\">Various Coin Core Updates ✅</h3><p>We've made several updates to the various coins available on BasicSwap DEX. Whether these updates involve new core versions or integration improvements, we highly recommend updating your node versions as soon as possible.</p><h3 id=\"significant-ui-refactor-\">Significant UI Refactor ?️</h3><p>A major refactoring of the user interface code has occurred over the last couple of weeks. While these changes primarily involve code organization and better practices that aren't immediately apparent to end users, we've also implemented numerous UI upgrades, including:</p><ul><li>Local reputation tracking</li><li>Enhanced order book formatting with additional information</li><li>New Bids page</li><li>Improved Swaps in Progress page</li><li>Better Offer pages</li><li>More responsive and dynamic page behavior</li><li>Better rate fetching</li><li>Much more...</li></ul><p>The interface changes since our last version (v0.14.4) are substantial, and you'll miss out on many new features and improvements if you don't update.</p><h3 id=\"client-authentication-\">Client Authentication ?</h3><p>We've added the ability to configure your BasicSwap instance with client authentication. This feature protects both the webUI and API port access with a password of your choosing. </p><p>This is vital if you're running BasicSwap on a cloud server or using the market-making companion script in a network environment you don't completely trust. To set up client authentication, please refer to the installation documentation.</p><h3 id=\"multi-net-support-\">Multi-Net Support ?</h3><p>We've pushed to <code class=\"language-text\">master</code> the preliminary code for upcoming multi network support for BasicSwap. We've deployed the first phase of a significant infrastructure update to our networking architecture. This new feature, currently called \"multi-net,\" enables BasicSwap to distribute swap, offer, and bid messages across multiple messaging networks beyond SMSG when the primary network experiences high load.</p><p>Since all messages adhere to a unified encryption and formatting standard, even non-decentralized networks (such as Telegram or email) could be utilized without compromising user privacy or security.</p><p>This new functionality delivers several key benefits:</p><ol><li>Improved platform scalability and resilience</li><li>Greater flexibility for third-party integrations, allowing partners to use their preferred compatible networks for message relay</li><li>Cross-network message compatibility, eliminating the need for users to operate on the same network during swaps</li></ol><p>While the foundation is now in place, further development is still needed before the implementation becomes fully usable. The current proof of concept using Simplex broadcasts messages to the entire group rather than targeting specific recipients — an inefficiency we're addressing given Simplex's limitations.</p><p>The core architecture is designed to extend SMSG functionality across various networks. All messages maintain SMSG encryption and message IDs for consistency, although additional work is required to ensure full compatibility of Python SMSG messages across all networks and to add convenience functions for submitting pre-formed SMSG messages. Currently, this new system pushes to the core through P2P connections (for SMSG testing) but doesn't yet join the SMSG and Simplex networks.</p><p>Not to be overlooked is the important advantage of this approach in its flexibility regarding network requirements. Since messages are (or will be) fully valid SMSG entities, they can be transmitted over plaintext networks like Telegram, Delta, or even Pastebin. Email systems supporting POP3/IMAP protocols are particularly well-suited for more decentralization-focused users. It's worth noting that centralized options, including Simplex, may still expose some information pseudonymously about which accounts are communicating with each other.</p><h3 id=\"acceptance-strategy-knowledge-\">Acceptance Strategy Knowledge ?</h3><p>When publishing a new offer, the SMSG messages relaying its details to the rest of the network now carry information about whether the offer is set to automatically accept bids. This information is also displayed on an offer's page before submitting a bid, helping you make better-informed decisions about which offers to bid on.</p><p>Please note that this change means previous instances of BasicSwap will not be able to properly resolve offer messages from up-to-date instances. Updating your BasicSwap instance is mandatory to receive all offers from the network. However, offer messages from older instances remain compatible with the new version, so upgrading now carries no downside.</p><h3 id=\"docs-\">Docs ?️</h3><p>We've migrated BasicSwap's documentation from the Particl Academy (which uses ReadTheDocs) to a more maintainable and flexible platform (Docusaurus) at <a href=\"https://docs.basicswapdex.com/docs/intro/\">docs.basicswapdex.com</a>. While we'll maintain the BasicSwap documentation on the Particl Academy, all new updates will be provided at the new location.</p><h2 id=\"install-the-latest-basicswap-update-\">Install the Latest BasicSwap Update ?️</h2><p>Due to a significant change in what data is carried in BasicSwap-related messages, it is mandatory to update the DEX. Failure to do so will result in your instance not picking up messages from up-to-date instances.</p><p>To install the new update, which includes both the codebase and user interface updates, simply <a

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nNew Update is Live ✅\nMandatory BasicSwap Update (v0.14.4)BasicSwap’s new 3.2.1 user interface and\n0.14.4 codebase are now available, featuring a wide range of improvements\nacross\nthe board.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/mandatory-basicswap-update-v0-14-4/]Earlier this week,\nwe've pushed a rather large BasicSwap update, bumping its codebase version to\n0.14.4 and its UI version to 3.2.1. This update includes a large amount of\nchanges, with notable mentions for a significant UI refactor, the addition of\nclient authentication, multi-net support, order acceptance knowledge, and much\nmore.\n\nDue to changes in the data structure of BasicSwap-related SMSG messages,\nprevious instances of the DEX are not forward-compatible with this new version.\nThis means that offers posted from updated instances will not appear on older\ninstances. All users must update to maintain full network connectivity.\n\nFor this reason, head over to the release blog post\n[https://particl.news/mandatory-basicswap-update-v0-14-4/] if you haven't\nupdated BasicSwap yet and make sure to do so.\n\n> Link :https://particl.news/mandatory-basicswap-update-v0-14-4/\nMulti-Net Support ?\nWhile a preliminary portion of what's needed for complete multi-net support has\nbeen released with this update, we're continuing to work on a range of other\ncomponents that will make BasicSwap fully compatible with any messaging or data\nnetworks.\n\nLight Wallets ?\nAfter completing multi-net support, our next focus will likely be implementing\nsupport for light wallets or remote nodes for most coins available on BasicSwap.\nThis will allow you to set up BasicSwap without syncing a full node or storing\nthe entire blockchain on your device, significantly improving setup time and\nconvenience.\n\nNote that this feature will be offered as an option, allowing you to still set\nup the DEX using full nodes for maximum security and privacy if preferred.\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nWhile we intended to integrate market making and advanced trading into the UI\nearlier, we've spent most of the past month refactoring the user interface's\nbackend. Now that this work is complete, we'll resume development on these\nfeatures.\n\nAdvanced Order Book Display ?\nAnother area we plan to advance during the next development cycle is the\naddition of advanced data visualization in the order book, notably depth charts\nfor each trading pair and split order book displaying buy and sell offers on\nseparate sides\n\nThese improvements will bring BasicSwap's order book experience closer to what\nusers expect when interacting with centralized exchanges, bridging the gap\nbetween traditional platforms and decentralized trading—allowing users to enjoy\nconvenience benefits without the typical security trade-offs.\n\nPART in MEXC Assessment Zone ⚠️\nA few days ago, MEXC placed the PART trading pair in its Assessment Zone due to\nlow order book liquidity and insufficient total value of PART coins deposited on\nthe platform.\n\nWhile this does not constitute a formal delisting yet, the exchange has\ncommunicated that the community must increase both liquidity and the total\nnumber of PART coins held on the exchange to maintain the listing.\n\nTherefore, we invite community members who wish to preserve PART's presence on\nMEXC to consider contributing to order book liquidity and depositing some of\ntheir coins on the exchange.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

This new feature, currently called \"multi-net,\" enables\nBasicSwap to distribute swap, offer, and bid messages across multiple messaging\nnetworks beyond SMSG when the primary network experiences high load.\n\nSince all messages adhere to a unified encryption and formatting standard, even\nnon-decentralized networks (such as Telegram or email) could be utilized without\ncompromising user privacy or security.\n\nThis new functionality delivers several key benefits:\n\n 1. Improved platform scalability and resilience\n 2. Greater flexibility for third-party integrations, allowing partners to use\n    their preferred compatible networks for message relay\n 3. Cross-network message compatibility, eliminating the need for users to\n    operate on the same network during swaps\n\nWhile the foundation is now in place, further development is still needed before\nthe implementation becomes fully usable. The current proof of concept using\nSimplex broadcasts messages to the entire group rather than targeting specific\nrecipients — an inefficiency we're addressing given Simplex's limitations.\n\nThe core architecture is designed to extend SMSG functionality across various\nnetworks. All messages maintain SMSG encryption and message IDs for consistency,\nalthough additional work is required to ensure full compatibility of Python SMSG\nmessages across all networks and to add convenience functions for submitting\npre-formed SMSG messages. Currently, this new system pushes to the core through\nP2P connections (for SMSG testing) but doesn't yet join the SMSG and Simplex\nnetworks.\n\nNot to be overlooked is the important advantage of this approach in its\nflexibility regarding network requirements. Since messages are (or will be)\nfully valid SMSG entities, they can be transmitted over plaintext networks like\nTelegram, Delta, or even Pastebin. Email systems supporting POP3/IMAP protocols\nare particularly well-suited for more decentralization-focused users.

112 commits coming from 6 different contributors\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/compare/v0.14.1...v0.14.2], we are\nexcited to announce the release of BasicSwap version 0.14.2, along with an\nupdate to its user interface, now at version 3.1.\n\nThis substantial update represents weeks of dedicated effort, incorporating\nnumerous improvements, bug fixes, and new features.
