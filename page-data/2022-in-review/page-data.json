What's more, in\nJune, we unveiled our new vision for the platform's infrastructure, one designed\nto be fully open, modular, and incorporate a multitude of new and cutting-edge\ncapabilities. This strategic refocus is essential in advancing Particl and\nfacilitating its adoption by a broader audience.\n\nBut before we continue to discuss what's in store for the future, let us take a\nstep back and recognize the accomplishments that have been achieved throughout\nthe year.\n\nParticl Core\nGitHub - particl/particl-core: Particl Core integration/staging treeParticl\nCore\nintegration/staging tree. Contribute to particl/particl-core development by\ncreating an account on GitHub.GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core]Particl Core, the platform’s\nblockchain, is precisely what its name implies; it is the backbone of the PART\ncryptocurrency and powers safe and private currency transactions using the PART\ncoin — complete with a wide range of features like private transactions,\nsmart-contracts, and advanced financial capabilities to be used in intricate\ndecentralized applications.\n\nOne important particularity of the Particl blockchain is that it is forked from\nBitcoin and is actively maintained up-to-date with all its upstream updates —\nproviding you with the assurance that your funds are secure and that the\nplatform has the necessary capabilities to provide all the modern, enhanced\nfunctionality of Bitcoin.\n\nThe significance of this cannot be overstated. By leveraging the Bitcoin\ndeveloper community, the Particl ecosystem directly benefits from its entire\ntalent pool. This can be easily seen by simply examining blockchain Github\nrankings, like CryptoMiso [https://www.cryptomiso.com/] for example, where the\nParticl Core repository currently ranks 11th out of all the coins listed.\n\nThis is a testament to the strength of open-source development and its global\ncollective of dedicated contributors embodying its vision in their everyday\nlives.\n\nReleases\n * Jan 9, 2022 — Particl Core 0.21.2.6\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.6]\n * Jan 17, 2022 — Particl Core 0.19.2.19\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.19]\n * Feb 1, 2022 — Taproot goes live on mainnet (Particl Core 0.19.2.18\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.18]) *\n * Feb 8, 2022 — Particl Core 0.19.2.19\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.19]\n * Feb 24, 2022 — Particl Core 0.19.2.19\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.19]\n * Apr 13, 2022 — Particl Core 0.19.2.20\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.20]\n * Apr 15, 2022 — Particl Core 0.21.2.8\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.8]\n * Apr 15, 2022 — Particl Core 22.0.2\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v22.0.2.0]\n * Apr 16, 2022 — Particl Core 23.0.2.0\n   [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v23.0.2.0]\n * Apr 25, 2022 — Particl Core 0.21.2.9\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.9]\n * Aug 4, 2022 — Particl Core 0.19.2.21\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.21]\n * Aug 4, 2022 — Particl Core 0.21.2.10\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.10]\n * Aug 20, 2022 — Particl Core 0.19.2.22\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.22]\n * Aug 21, 2022 — Particl Core 0.21.2.11\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.11]\n * Aug 21, 2022 — Particl Core 22.0.3\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v22.0.3.0]\n * Oct 2, 2022 — Particl Core 24.0.1.0 RC1\n   [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v24.0.1.0rc1]\n * Nov 12, 2022 — Particl Core 23.0.3\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v23.0.3.0]\n\n* Particl Core 0.19.2.18 was released on December 13, 2021, but the Taproot\nhardfork was pre-scheduled to go live on the 1st of February, 2022.\n\nParticl Desktop\nGitHub - particl/particl-desktop: The GUI application for Particl Markeplace\nand\nPART coin wallet.

It is, indeed, a\ncomprehensive ecosystem of privacy-first dApps that prioritize privacy and\ndecentralization above all else.\n\nAs such, the ecosystem requires user-oriented gateways, or user interfaces,\nthrough which you can interact with applications like the Particl Marketplace.\nWithout it, you would be limited to only a command-line or basic Qt-like\ninterfaces, both of which being less-than-optimal user experiences.\n\nThat’s where Particl Desktop comes in. It is a desktop client which provides\nusers with a unified and user-friendly interface for interacting with a suite of\napplications. Its current functions include acting as a cryptocurrency wallet\nmanagement, a decentralized marketplace, and a decentralized autonomous\norganization (DAO) governance portal. In 2023 and beyond, its scope will expand\nto include a multitude of additional features and capabilities, becoming more\nakin to a \"dApp OS\", but more on that further down below this article.\n\nThere’s no denying. Particl Desktop is a vital element within the Particl\necosystem, and, similar to Particl Core, it has been improved multiple times\nthroughout 2022.\n\nReleases\n * Jan 4, 2022 — v3.1.0\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.0]\n * Feb 4, 2022 — v3.1.1\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.1]\n * Apr 12, 2022 — v3.1.2\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.2]\n * Apr 14 2022 — v3.1.3\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.3]\n * May 9, 2022 — v3.2.0\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0]\n * Jun 29, 2022 — v3.2.1\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.1]\n * Jul 1, 2022 — v3.2.2\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.2]\n * Dec 24, 2022 — v3.3.0-RC001\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0-testing-RC001] \n    (testnet ongoing) *\n\n* Particl Desktop 3.3 is a transitory release into the new development cycle\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/].\n\nBasicSwap DEX\nGitHub - tecnovert/basicswap: Basic Atomic Swap Proof of ConceptBasic Atomic\nSwap Proof of Concept. Contribute to tecnovert/basicswap development by\ncreating\nan account on GitHub.GitHubtecnovert [https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap]\nPerhaps the most exciting release of the year, BasicSwap is Particl’s brand new\ndApp. Indeed, the simultaneous failure of the FTX scam exchange and the release\nof the BasicSwap DEX proved to be an opportune moment for Particl, as it brought\nconsiderable attention to the platform and its mission.\n\nIt is a peer-to-peer (P2P) trading exchange that offers a secure, private, and\ncompletely decentralized trading platform. It eliminates the need for central\npoints of failure or third-party interferences, allowing you to freely swap\ncryptocurrencies with full confidence and in total privacy. This groundbreaking\ndApp is sure to revolutionize the way people trade cryptocurrencies, and is a\nmajor milestone in the evolution of both the Particl project and the broader\ncryptocurrency industry.\n\nBasicSwap was released to the public, on the 7th of December, 2022, as an open\nbeta. The DEX, which functions over mainnet networks, is fully functional for a\nvariety of coins [https://basicswapdex.com/markets] (including Monero).\n\nHowever, it’s important to keep in mind that BasicSwap is still in its early\nstages and is currently better geared for more experienced users. To use it\ntoday, you must manually compile the Python code, which should only take a few\nminutes. Additionally, you must ensure that the blockchains of the coins you\nhave enabled are synced locally on your device.\n\nBut don’t despair, this is merely the first step in a more comprehensive and\nend-user friendly vision for the DEX, which we will expound upon in the second\nhalf of this blog post.\n\nReleases\n * Nov 30, 2022 — BasicSwap.com Website Release [https://BasicSwapDEX.com/]\n * Dec 7, 2022 — BSX Open Beta\n   [https://particl.news/basicswap-open-beta-is-now-live/]\n\nParticl Electrum\nGitHub - particl/electrum: Electrum Particl WalletElectrum Particl Wallet.\nContribute to particl/electrum development by creating an account on GitHub.\nGitHubparticl [https://github.com/particl/electrum]As part of our efforts to\nmake BasicSwap (and other Particl dApps) more easily accessible, we’ve made\nearly strides in providing more light services to the network with the release\nof Particl Electrum, a fork of Bitcoin’s Electrum wallet. It is expected to play\nan important role in the ecosystem moving forward, whether that is more of a\nback-end one or not.\n\nIndeed, being able to easily fork an open-source wallet like Electrum is one of\nthe many benefits in keeping up-to-date with Bitcoin upstream updates, as we’ve\nmentioned earlier in this blog post.\n\nBut the wallet provides much more than just light services; it is a feature-rich\nand easy-to-use cryptocurrency wallet that can be set up in just a few seconds.\nAnd as a sweet bonus, it also doubles as a mobile wallet, providing you with an\nadded layer of convenience and security you can bring with you on-the-go!\n\nReleases\n * Mar 25, 2022 — 4.2.1.3\n   [https://github.com/particl/electrum/releases/tag/4.2.1.3_particl]\n * Mar 30, 2022 — 4.2.1.4\n   [https://github.com/particl/electrum/releases/tag/4.2.1.4_particl]\n\nParticl Stories\nStories - Particl NewsLearn more about Particl’s mission, vision, and purpose\nthrough stories that expose some of the lesser-known problems that affect us\nevery day.Particl News2 Nov 2022 • 5 min read\n[https://particl.news/tag/stories/]While technical releases are important —\nafter all, they are what makes the ecosystem — it is important to understand\nthem as part of a greater whole.\n\nTo better communicate our mission, vision, and the values that motivate the\nParticl team, we’ve started sharing, from time to time, different “stories” that\ntouch on different topics relevant to Particl.\n\nThese stories provide more context to what we do, and we certainly plan on\npublishing more of these as we move forward.

Indeed, we’ve achieved numerous milestones that have\npositioned us well for the coming year, and we are eager to share what comes\nnext with you.\n\nA New Development Cycle Begins\nIt may have been a few months since we’ve announced Particl’s upcoming\ndevelopment cycle\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/], but with the\nimminent mainnet release of Particl Desktop 3.3, the time has finally come for\nit to start taking form.\n\nParticl's upcoming development cycle is set to revolutionize the ecosystem's\narchitecture, making it modular in design and more open to external\ncontributors. In summary, it bases itself on four pillars:\n\n1- SMSG 2.0 — A Decentralized & Private Internet Protocol\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#1-smsg-2-0-a-decentralized-and-private-internet-protocol]\n:\n\nA major deliverable of Particl’s upcoming development cycle is a new, enhanced\nversion of the SMSG network — Particl’s privacy-first peer-to-peer data network\npowering its dApps like Particl Marketplace or BasicSwap DEX.\n\nThis update intends to make the network faster, but also much more scalable and\nable to sustain consumer-levels of traffic, as well as provide additional\nfunctionality such as hosting, directly on its network, applications, web pages,\nand other types of data or content.\n\n2- A New Modular Architecture\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#2-giving-particl-a-modular-dimension]\n:\n\nPerhaps the most important aspect of this development cycle is the breaking down\nof Particl components into independent modules that can interact with each\nother, but without depending on one another.\n\nThis will facilitate greater contributions to the ecosystem, and will reduce the\noverhead of upkeep for each application or initiative, regardless of whether\nthey are developed by the Particl team or community contributors.\n\nAdditionally, the introduction of a developer SDK and a more streamlined\ndevelopment process for the entire ecosystem will enable improved\ninteroperability of the modules, allowing developers to leverage the\ncontributions of others to incorporate functionality into their own dApps or\nservices.\n\n3- Access Gateways and dApp Accessibility\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#3-a-greater-focus-on-access-gateways-and-dapp-accessibility]\n:\n\nOne of the main benefits of implementing a modular and open architecture is the\nease of integration into third-party applications. For instance, BasicSwap could\nbe readily integrated into popular cryptocurrency wallets, drastically improving\nthe exposure of the ecosystem as a whole by exposing it to an entirely new\naudience.\n\nBut the reverse is equally true: it also makes it simpler to incorporate\nthird-party services, such as advanced eCommerce inventory management systems,\ninto Particl dApps like Particl Marketplace.\n\nThis will, notably, enable a broader range of gateways to interact with\ndecentralized applications. These can include web and mobile frameworks,\nallowing users to access the marketplace, for example, from any location as long\nas they can get an internet connection and access to a web browser.\n\nThe changes brought by this new development cycle will bring an unprecedented\nlevel of accessibility, user-friendliness, and intuitive design while\nmaintaining a high degree of privacy and decentralization. This will position\nthe platform perfectly for adoption, as people will now be able to enjoy the\nbenefits of a secure and decentralized system without sacrificing too much\nconvenience.\n\n4- Currency and Protocol Agnosticism\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#4-a-commitment-to-agnosticism]\n:\n\nIt is well established that any technology-based platform that fails to embrace\nthe ever-evolving nature of the industry it inhabits will not be able to sustain\nitself in the long run. As technology advances at an accelerated rate, platforms\nmust be able to adapt to the changing landscape in order to remain viable.\n\nAs such, Particl’s upcoming development cycle will introduce a much larger\ndegree of agnosticism with the currencies that can be used on the platform, but\nalso with the protocols that can power its dApps.\n\nCurrently, Particl dApps only work using either the Particl blockchain, the SMSG\nnetwork, or some combination of both. While this is a viable solution in many\nways, it hinders the platform's ability to gain traction beyond its existing\nuser base, and overlooks the potential advantages that alternative protocols may\nbe able to provide.\n\nThis is why we want to move ahead as a truly open project, embracing various\ncryptocurrencies and protocols with the aim of providing the best levels of\nprivacy, freedom, and self-empowerment to the greatest number of humans as\npossible.\n\nBut don’t be afraid! PART will continue to play a central role in the coming\ncycle. It offers capabilities that are not available with other\ncryptocurrencies, particularly in terms of its unique ability to combine privacy\nand flexibility. We also fully expect that many future decentralized\napplications will require PART and its unique capabilities in order to simply\nfunction.\n\nAdditionally, the proposed changes will greatly facilitate the development of\napplications and services, many of which can be creatively monetized by their\ncreators to the benefit of the network. We anticipate that these changes will\nresult in a net and significant increase in PART usage, while bringing real\nvalue to other cryptocurrencies as well.\n\nCurrent Roadmap\nTo adequately map out the path forward as we progress through the upcoming\ndevelopment cycle, we’ve published a roadmap which marks the most important\nmilestones. It is separated into two main phases: the foundational phase and the\ndeployment phase.\n\nThe foundational phase is dedicated to constructing a modular and open\narchitecture for the ecosystem. The deployment phase, on the other hand,\ninvolves integrating the new foundation design into existing dApps, integrating\nthem into new gateways (i.e., web access), and developing new applications and\nservices (or variants of current ones) as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we reach the deployment phase of the roadmap, the Particl ecosystem will be\nfully open and modular; primed to receive a wide range of contributions from the\ncommunity. This will enable the integration of dApps into third-party platforms,\nwhich is likely to result in a significant snowball or domino effect on all\nfronts.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd there we have it, the full review of 2022 and a glimpse of what to expect in\n2023 and beyond.\n\nWith the project maturing into an ever-more useful and integrated ecosystem, it\nis clear that it is becoming increasingly relevant and pivotal in the face of\nthe new challenges our world faces.\n\nWe'd like to express our most sincere gratitude to you all in the community for\nyour passion, contributions, and trust. We promise to always  keep pushing\nboundaries and give everything we've got to make 2023 the most exciting year for\nParticl yet!\n\nCheers to all of you in this awesome community — the power to change the world\nfor the better lies in our collective hands! ?\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

What's more, in June, we unveiled our new vision for the platform's infrastructure, one designed to be fully open, modular, and incorporate a multitude of new and cutting-edge capabilities. This strategic refocus is essential in advancing Particl and facilitating its adoption by a broader audience.</p><p>But before we continue to discuss what's in store for the future, let us take a step back and recognize the accomplishments that have been achieved throughout the year.</p><h2 id=\"particl-core\">Particl Core</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">GitHub - particl/particl-core: Particl Core integration/staging tree</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Particl Core integration/staging tree.

By leveraging the Bitcoin developer community, the Particl ecosystem directly benefits from its entire talent pool. This can be easily seen by simply examining blockchain Github rankings, like <a href=\"https://www.cryptomiso.com/\">CryptoMiso</a> for example, where the Particl Core repository currently ranks 11th out of all the coins listed.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/akPCMt7PFFI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"Particl Core — 2022 Development Progress\"></iframe></figure><p>This is a testament to the strength of open-source development and its global collective of dedicated contributors embodying its vision in their everyday lives.</p><h3 id=\"releases\">Releases</h3><ul><li><strong>Jan 9, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.6\">Particl Core 0.21.2.6</a></li><li><strong>Jan 17, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.19\">Particl Core 0.19.2.19</a></li><li><strong>Feb 1, 2022 —</strong> <em>Taproot goes live on mainnet</em> (<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.18\"><em>Particl Core 0.19.2.18</em></a>) <em>*</em></li><li><strong>Feb 8, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.19\">Particl Core 0.19.2.19</a></li><li><strong>Feb 24, 2022 — </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.19\">Particl Core 0.19.2.19</a></li><li><strong>Apr 13, 2022 — </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.20\">Particl Core 0.19.2.20</a></li><li><strong>Apr 15, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.8\">Particl Core 0.21.2.8</a></li><li><strong>Apr 15, 2022 — </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v22.0.2.0\">Particl Core 22.0.2</a></li><li><strong>Apr 16, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v23.0.2.0\">Particl Core 23.0.2.0</a></li><li><strong>Apr 25, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.9\">Particl Core 0.21.2.9</a></li><li><strong>Aug 4, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.21\">Particl Core 0.19.2.21</a></li><li><strong>Aug 4, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.10\">Particl Core 0.21.2.10</a></li><li><strong>Aug 20, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.22\">Particl Core 0.19.2.22</a></li><li><strong>Aug 21, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.11\">Particl Core 0.21.2.11</a></li><li><strong>Aug 21, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v22.0.3.0\">Particl Core 22.0.3</a></li><li><strong>Oct 2, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v24.0.1.0rc1\">Particl Core 24.0.1.0 RC1</a></li><li><strong>Nov 12, 2022 — </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v23.0.3.0\">Particl Core 23.0.3</a></li></ul><p><em>* Particl Core 0.19.2.18 was released on December 13, 2021, but the Taproot hardfork was pre-scheduled to go live on the 1st of February, 2022.</em></p><h2 id=\"particl-desktop\">Particl Desktop</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">GitHub - particl/particl-desktop: The GUI application for Particl Markeplace and PART coin wallet.

It is, indeed, a comprehensive ecosystem of privacy-first dApps that prioritize privacy and decentralization above all else.</p><p>As such, the ecosystem requires user-oriented gateways, or user interfaces, through which you can interact with applications like the Particl Marketplace. Without it, you would be limited to only a command-line or basic Qt-like interfaces, both of which being less-than-optimal user experiences.</p><p>That’s where Particl Desktop comes in. It is a desktop client which provides users with a unified and user-friendly interface for interacting with a suite of applications. Its current functions include acting as a cryptocurrency wallet management, a decentralized marketplace, and a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance portal. In 2023 and beyond, its scope will expand to include a multitude of additional features and capabilities, becoming more akin to a \"dApp OS\", but more on that further down below this article.</p><p>There’s no denying. Particl Desktop is a vital element within the Particl ecosystem, and, similar to Particl Core, it has been improved multiple times throughout 2022.</p><h3 id=\"releases-1\">Releases</h3><ul><li><strong>Jan 4, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.0\">v3.1.0</a></li><li><strong>Feb 4, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.1\">v3.1.1</a></li><li><strong>Apr 12, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.2\">v3.1.2</a></li><li><strong>Apr 14 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.3\">v3.1.3</a></li><li><strong>May 9, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0\">v3.2.0</a></li><li><strong>Jun 29, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.1\">v3.2.1</a></li><li><strong>Jul 1, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.2\">v3.2.2</a></li><li><strong>Dec 24, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0-testing-RC001\">v3.3.0-RC001</a> <em>(testnet ongoing) *</em></li></ul><p><em>* Particl Desktop 3.3 is a transitory release into </em><a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/\"><em>the new development cycle</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2 id=\"basicswap-dex\">BasicSwap DEX</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">GitHub - tecnovert/basicswap: Basic Atomic Swap Proof of Concept</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Basic Atomic Swap Proof of Concept.

It eliminates the need for central points of failure or third-party interferences, allowing you to freely swap cryptocurrencies with full confidence and in total privacy. This groundbreaking dApp is sure to revolutionize the way people trade cryptocurrencies, and is a major milestone in the evolution of both the Particl project and the broader cryptocurrency industry.</p><p>BasicSwap was released to the public, on the 7th of December, 2022, as an open beta. The DEX, which functions over mainnet networks, is fully functional for <a href=\"https://basicswapdex.com/markets\">a variety of coins</a> (including Monero).</p><p>However, it’s important to keep in mind that BasicSwap is still in its early stages and is currently better geared for more experienced users. To use it today, you must manually compile the Python code, which should only take a few minutes. Additionally, you must ensure that the blockchains of the coins you have enabled are synced locally on your device.</p><p>But don’t despair, this is merely the first step in a more comprehensive and end-user friendly vision for the DEX, which we will expound upon in the second half of this blog post.</p><h3 id=\"releases-2\">Releases</h3><ul><li><strong>Nov 30, 2022 — </strong><a href=\"https://BasicSwapDEX.com/\">BasicSwap.com Website Release</a></li><li><strong>Dec 7, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://particl.news/basicswap-open-beta-is-now-live/\">BSX Open Beta</a></li></ul><h2 id=\"particl-electrum\">Particl Electrum</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/particl/electrum\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">GitHub - particl/electrum: Electrum Particl Wallet</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Electrum Particl Wallet.

Indeed, we’ve achieved numerous milestones that have positioned us well for the coming year, and we are eager to share what comes next with you.</p><h3 id=\"a-new-development-cycle-begins\">A New Development Cycle Begins</h3><p>It may have been a few months since we’ve announced <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/\">Particl’s upcoming development cycle</a>, but with the imminent mainnet release of Particl Desktop 3.3, the time has finally come for it to start taking form.</p><p>Particl's upcoming development cycle is set to revolutionize the ecosystem's architecture, making it modular in design and more open to external contributors. In summary, it bases itself on four pillars:</p><p>1- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#1-smsg-2-0-a-decentralized-and-private-internet-protocol\"><strong>SMSG 2.0 — A Decentralized &amp; Private Internet Protocol</strong></a>:</p><p>A major deliverable of Particl’s upcoming development cycle is a new, enhanced version of the SMSG network — Particl’s privacy-first peer-to-peer data network powering its dApps like Particl Marketplace or BasicSwap DEX.</p><p>This update intends to make the network faster, but also much more scalable and able to sustain consumer-levels of traffic, as well as provide additional functionality such as hosting, directly on its network, applications, web pages, and other types of data or content.</p><p>2- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#2-giving-particl-a-modular-dimension\"><strong>A New Modular Architecture</strong></a>:</p><p>Perhaps the most important aspect of this development cycle is the breaking down of Particl components into independent modules that can interact with each other, but without depending on one another.</p><p>This will facilitate greater contributions to the ecosystem, and will reduce the overhead of upkeep for each application or initiative, regardless of whether they are developed by the Particl team or community contributors.</p><p>Additionally, the introduction of a developer SDK and a more streamlined development process for the entire ecosystem will enable improved interoperability of the modules, allowing developers to leverage the contributions of others to incorporate functionality into their own dApps or services.</p><p>3- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#3-a-greater-focus-on-access-gateways-and-dapp-accessibility\"><strong>Access Gateways and dApp Accessibility</strong></a>:</p><p>One of the main benefits of implementing a modular and open architecture is the ease of integration into third-party applications. For instance, BasicSwap could be readily integrated into popular cryptocurrency wallets, drastically improving the exposure of the ecosystem as a whole by exposing it to an entirely new audience.</p><p>But the reverse is equally true: it also makes it simpler to incorporate third-party services, such as advanced eCommerce inventory management systems, into Particl dApps like Particl Marketplace.</p><p>This will, notably, enable a broader range of gateways to interact with decentralized applications. These can include web and mobile frameworks, allowing users to access the marketplace, for example, from any location as long as they can get an internet connection and access to a web browser.</p><p>The changes brought by this new development cycle will bring an unprecedented level of accessibility, user-friendliness, and intuitive design while maintaining a high degree of privacy and decentralization. This will position the platform perfectly for adoption, as people will now be able to enjoy the benefits of a secure and decentralized system without sacrificing too much convenience.</p><p>4- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#4-a-commitment-to-agnosticism\"><strong>Currency and Protocol Agnosticism</strong></a>:</p><p>It is well established that any technology-based platform that fails to embrace the ever-evolving nature of the industry it inhabits will not be able to sustain itself in the long run. As technology advances at an accelerated rate, platforms must be able to adapt to the changing landscape in order to remain viable.</p><p>As such, Particl’s upcoming development cycle will introduce a much larger degree of agnosticism with the currencies that can be used on the platform, but also with the protocols that can power its dApps.</p><p>Currently, Particl dApps only work using either the Particl blockchain, the SMSG network, or some combination of both. While this is a viable solution in many ways, it hinders the platform's ability to gain traction beyond its existing user base, and overlooks the potential advantages that alternative protocols may be able to provide.</p><p>This is why we want to move ahead as a truly open project, embracing various cryptocurrencies and protocols with the aim of providing the best levels of privacy, freedom, and self-empowerment to the greatest number of humans as possible.</p><p>But don’t be afraid! PART will continue to play a central role in the coming cycle. It offers capabilities that are not available with other cryptocurrencies, particularly in terms of its unique ability to combine privacy and flexibility. We also fully expect that many future decentralized applications will require PART and its unique capabilities in order to simply function.</p><p>Additionally, the proposed changes will greatly facilitate the development of applications and services, many of which can be creatively monetized by their creators to the benefit of the network. We anticipate that these changes will result in a net and significant increase in PART usage, while bringing real value to other cryptocurrencies as well.</p><h3 id=\"current-roadmap\">Current Roadmap</h3><p>To adequately map out the path forward as we progress through the upcoming development cycle, we’ve published a roadmap which marks the most important milestones. It is separated into two main phases: the foundational phase and the deployment phase.</p><p>The foundational phase is dedicated to constructing a modular and open architecture for the ecosystem. The deployment phase, on the other hand, involves integrating the new foundation design into existing dApps, integrating them into new gateways (i.e., web access), and developing new applications and services (or variants of current ones) as well.</p><p></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CbSmkQORjugImKLG964tdEtrP3JCH-zXg-DxpO43cM9b5m5-3i7IduM5aeIIXFdnPXXJKQ-TilmOddX2yHqnTjYlczHTZfsjTrpod-ZNVWw06gHCT1E_sXVkD-WNFVe_GVaKUSkmlEprhu6pJGsaeSc9ic9zUODTNIHLGENu2n80GpAtFhlL_WNGiOWmiA\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p></p><p>Once we reach the deployment phase of the roadmap, the Particl ecosystem will be fully open and modular; primed to receive a wide range of contributions from the community. This will enable the integration of dApps into third-party platforms, which is likely to result in a significant snowball or domino effect on all fronts.</p><hr><p>And there we have it, the full review of 2022 and a glimpse of what to expect in 2023 and beyond.</p><p>With the project maturing into an ever-more useful and integrated ecosystem, it is clear that it is becoming increasingly relevant and pivotal in the face of the new challenges our world faces.</p><p>We'd like to express our most sincere gratitude to you all in the community for your passion, contributions, and trust. We promise to always  keep pushing boundaries and give everything we've got to make 2023 the most exciting year for Particl yet!</p><p>Cheers to all of you in this awesome community — the power to change the world for the better lies in our collective hands! ?</p><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

By leveraging the Bitcoin developer community, the Particl ecosystem directly benefits from its entire talent pool. This can be easily seen by simply examining blockchain Github rankings, like <a href=\"https://www.cryptomiso.com/\">CryptoMiso</a> for example, where the Particl Core repository currently ranks 11th out of all the coins listed.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/akPCMt7PFFI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"Particl Core — 2022 Development Progress\"></iframe></figure><p>This is a testament to the strength of open-source development and its global collective of dedicated contributors embodying its vision in their everyday lives.</p><h3 id=\"releases\">Releases</h3><ul><li><strong>Jan 9, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.6\">Particl Core 0.21.2.6</a></li><li><strong>Jan 17, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.19\">Particl Core 0.19.2.19</a></li><li><strong>Feb 1, 2022 —</strong> <em>Taproot goes live on mainnet</em> (<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.18\"><em>Particl Core 0.19.2.18</em></a>) <em>*</em></li><li><strong>Feb 8, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.19\">Particl Core 0.19.2.19</a></li><li><strong>Feb 24, 2022 — </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.19\">Particl Core 0.19.2.19</a></li><li><strong>Apr 13, 2022 — </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.20\">Particl Core 0.19.2.20</a></li><li><strong>Apr 15, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.8\">Particl Core 0.21.2.8</a></li><li><strong>Apr 15, 2022 — </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v22.0.2.0\">Particl Core 22.0.2</a></li><li><strong>Apr 16, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v23.0.2.0\">Particl Core 23.0.2.0</a></li><li><strong>Apr 25, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.9\">Particl Core 0.21.2.9</a></li><li><strong>Aug 4, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.21\">Particl Core 0.19.2.21</a></li><li><strong>Aug 4, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.10\">Particl Core 0.21.2.10</a></li><li><strong>Aug 20, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.22\">Particl Core 0.19.2.22</a></li><li><strong>Aug 21, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.11\">Particl Core 0.21.2.11</a></li><li><strong>Aug 21, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v22.0.3.0\">Particl Core 22.0.3</a></li><li><strong>Oct 2, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v24.0.1.0rc1\">Particl Core 24.0.1.0 RC1</a></li><li><strong>Nov 12, 2022 — </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v23.0.3.0\">Particl Core 23.0.3</a></li></ul><p><em>* Particl Core 0.19.2.18 was released on December 13, 2021, but the Taproot hardfork was pre-scheduled to go live on the 1st of February, 2022.</em></p><h2 id=\"particl-desktop\">Particl Desktop</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">GitHub - particl/particl-desktop: The GUI application for Particl Markeplace and PART coin wallet.

It is, indeed, a comprehensive ecosystem of privacy-first dApps that prioritize privacy and decentralization above all else.</p><p>As such, the ecosystem requires user-oriented gateways, or user interfaces, through which you can interact with applications like the Particl Marketplace. Without it, you would be limited to only a command-line or basic Qt-like interfaces, both of which being less-than-optimal user experiences.</p><p>That’s where Particl Desktop comes in. It is a desktop client which provides users with a unified and user-friendly interface for interacting with a suite of applications. Its current functions include acting as a cryptocurrency wallet management, a decentralized marketplace, and a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance portal. In 2023 and beyond, its scope will expand to include a multitude of additional features and capabilities, becoming more akin to a \"dApp OS\", but more on that further down below this article.</p><p>There’s no denying. Particl Desktop is a vital element within the Particl ecosystem, and, similar to Particl Core, it has been improved multiple times throughout 2022.</p><h3 id=\"releases-1\">Releases</h3><ul><li><strong>Jan 4, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.0\">v3.1.0</a></li><li><strong>Feb 4, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.1\">v3.1.1</a></li><li><strong>Apr 12, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.2\">v3.1.2</a></li><li><strong>Apr 14 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.3\">v3.1.3</a></li><li><strong>May 9, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0\">v3.2.0</a></li><li><strong>Jun 29, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.1\">v3.2.1</a></li><li><strong>Jul 1, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.2\">v3.2.2</a></li><li><strong>Dec 24, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0-testing-RC001\">v3.3.0-RC001</a> <em>(testnet ongoing) *</em></li></ul><p><em>* Particl Desktop 3.3 is a transitory release into </em><a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/\"><em>the new development cycle</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2 id=\"basicswap-dex\">BasicSwap DEX</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">GitHub - tecnovert/basicswap: Basic Atomic Swap Proof of Concept</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Basic Atomic Swap Proof of Concept.

It eliminates the need for central points of failure or third-party interferences, allowing you to freely swap cryptocurrencies with full confidence and in total privacy. This groundbreaking dApp is sure to revolutionize the way people trade cryptocurrencies, and is a major milestone in the evolution of both the Particl project and the broader cryptocurrency industry.</p><p>BasicSwap was released to the public, on the 7th of December, 2022, as an open beta. The DEX, which functions over mainnet networks, is fully functional for <a href=\"https://basicswapdex.com/markets\">a variety of coins</a> (including Monero).</p><p>However, it’s important to keep in mind that BasicSwap is still in its early stages and is currently better geared for more experienced users. To use it today, you must manually compile the Python code, which should only take a few minutes. Additionally, you must ensure that the blockchains of the coins you have enabled are synced locally on your device.</p><p>But don’t despair, this is merely the first step in a more comprehensive and end-user friendly vision for the DEX, which we will expound upon in the second half of this blog post.</p><h3 id=\"releases-2\">Releases</h3><ul><li><strong>Nov 30, 2022 — </strong><a href=\"https://BasicSwapDEX.com/\">BasicSwap.com Website Release</a></li><li><strong>Dec 7, 2022 —</strong> <a href=\"https://particl.news/basicswap-open-beta-is-now-live/\">BSX Open Beta</a></li></ul><h2 id=\"particl-electrum\">Particl Electrum</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/particl/electrum\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">GitHub - particl/electrum: Electrum Particl Wallet</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Electrum Particl Wallet.

In summary, it bases itself on four pillars:</p><p>1- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#1-smsg-2-0-a-decentralized-and-private-internet-protocol\"><strong>SMSG 2.0 — A Decentralized &#x26; Private Internet Protocol</strong></a>:</p><p>A major deliverable of Particl’s upcoming development cycle is a new, enhanced version of the SMSG network — Particl’s privacy-first peer-to-peer data network powering its dApps like Particl Marketplace or BasicSwap DEX.</p><p>This update intends to make the network faster, but also much more scalable and able to sustain consumer-levels of traffic, as well as provide additional functionality such as hosting, directly on its network, applications, web pages, and other types of data or content.</p><p>2- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#2-giving-particl-a-modular-dimension\"><strong>A New Modular Architecture</strong></a>:</p><p>Perhaps the most important aspect of this development cycle is the breaking down of Particl components into independent modules that can interact with each other, but without depending on one another.</p><p>This will facilitate greater contributions to the ecosystem, and will reduce the overhead of upkeep for each application or initiative, regardless of whether they are developed by the Particl team or community contributors.</p><p>Additionally, the introduction of a developer SDK and a more streamlined development process for the entire ecosystem will enable improved interoperability of the modules, allowing developers to leverage the contributions of others to incorporate functionality into their own dApps or services.</p><p>3- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#3-a-greater-focus-on-access-gateways-and-dapp-accessibility\"><strong>Access Gateways and dApp Accessibility</strong></a>:</p><p>One of the main benefits of implementing a modular and open architecture is the ease of integration into third-party applications. For instance, BasicSwap could be readily integrated into popular cryptocurrency wallets, drastically improving the exposure of the ecosystem as a whole by exposing it to an entirely new audience.</p><p>But the reverse is equally true: it also makes it simpler to incorporate third-party services, such as advanced eCommerce inventory management systems, into Particl dApps like Particl Marketplace.</p><p>This will, notably, enable a broader range of gateways to interact with decentralized applications. These can include web and mobile frameworks, allowing users to access the marketplace, for example, from any location as long as they can get an internet connection and access to a web browser.</p><p>The changes brought by this new development cycle will bring an unprecedented level of accessibility, user-friendliness, and intuitive design while maintaining a high degree of privacy and decentralization. This will position the platform perfectly for adoption, as people will now be able to enjoy the benefits of a secure and decentralized system without sacrificing too much convenience.</p><p>4- <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/#4-a-commitment-to-agnosticism\"><strong>Currency and Protocol Agnosticism</strong></a>:</p><p>It is well established that any technology-based platform that fails to embrace the ever-evolving nature of the industry it inhabits will not be able to sustain itself in the long run. As technology advances at an accelerated rate, platforms must be able to adapt to the changing landscape in order to remain viable.</p><p>As such, Particl’s upcoming development cycle will introduce a much larger degree of agnosticism with the currencies that can be used on the platform, but also with the protocols that can power its dApps.</p><p>Currently, Particl dApps only work using either the Particl blockchain, the SMSG network, or some combination of both. While this is a viable solution in many ways, it hinders the platform's ability to gain traction beyond its existing user base, and overlooks the potential advantages that alternative protocols may be able to provide.</p><p>This is why we want to move ahead as a truly open project, embracing various cryptocurrencies and protocols with the aim of providing the best levels of privacy, freedom, and self-empowerment to the greatest number of humans as possible.</p><p>But don’t be afraid! PART will continue to play a central role in the coming cycle. It offers capabilities that are not available with other cryptocurrencies, particularly in terms of its unique ability to combine privacy and flexibility. We also fully expect that many future decentralized applications will require PART and its unique capabilities in order to simply function.</p><p>Additionally, the proposed changes will greatly facilitate the development of applications and services, many of which can be creatively monetized by their creators to the benefit of the network. We anticipate that these changes will result in a net and significant increase in PART usage, while bringing real value to other cryptocurrencies as well.</p><h3 id=\"current-roadmap\">Current Roadmap</h3><p>To adequately map out the path forward as we progress through the upcoming development cycle, we’ve published a roadmap which marks the most important milestones. It is separated into two main phases: the foundational phase and the deployment phase.</p><p>The foundational phase is dedicated to constructing a modular and open architecture for the ecosystem. The deployment phase, on the other hand, involves integrating the new foundation design into existing dApps, integrating them into new gateways (i.e., web access), and developing new applications and services (or variants of current ones) as well.</p><p></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CbSmkQORjugImKLG964tdEtrP3JCH-zXg-DxpO43cM9b5m5-3i7IduM5aeIIXFdnPXXJKQ-TilmOddX2yHqnTjYlczHTZfsjTrpod-ZNVWw06gHCT1E_sXVkD-WNFVe_GVaKUSkmlEprhu6pJGsaeSc9ic9zUODTNIHLGENu2n80GpAtFhlL_WNGiOWmiA\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p></p><p>Once we reach the deployment phase of the roadmap, the Particl ecosystem will be fully open and modular; primed to receive a wide range of contributions from the community. This will enable the integration of dApps into third-party platforms, which is likely to result in a significant snowball or domino effect on all fronts.</p><hr><p>And there we have it, the full review of 2022 and a glimpse of what to expect in 2023 and beyond.</p><p>With the project maturing into an ever-more useful and integrated ecosystem, it is clear that it is becoming increasingly relevant and pivotal in the face of the new challenges our world faces.</p><p>We'd like to express our most sincere gratitude to you all in the community for your passion, contributions, and trust. We promise to always  keep pushing boundaries and give everything we've got to make 2023 the most exciting year for Particl yet!</p><p>Cheers to all of you in this awesome community — the power to change the world for the better lies in our collective hands! ?</p><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

our weekly development\nprogress report! So let's quickly see what progress has been made in the past\nfew days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nOver the past week, our team has been focused on testing and executing minor\nadjustments for Particl Desktop 3.3. We have also been preparing for the\ncommencement of the upcoming development cycle and carefully assessing the most\neffective transition strategy to ensure a smooth process.\n\nWe are pleased to report that no significant issue has been found so far. As\nsuch, we are confident that the release will be ready for launch in the near\nfuture although we cannot communicate a precise mainnet release date yet.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. \n\nThis week, we have been working on a complex Bitcoin merge which has been\nrequiring a significant amount of time. \n\nAs highlighted in our yearly recap on Particl News, it is critical to maintain\nup-to-date upstream updates from Bitcoin in order to benefit from the entire\npool of talent and associated security, usability, and other improvements.\n\nThis is evident from CryptoMiso rankings [https://www.cryptomiso.com], where\nParticl Core currently ranks 11th out of all the coins listed. Additionally, the\nvisualisation below shows the code updates made to Particl Core in 2022, and the\nnumber of developers working on the project, directly or indirectly. \n\nYou can monitor these changes by visiting this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week's more intricate Bitcoin merges have required a significant amount of\ntime.\n\nNonetheless, we have managed to address a few issues, particularly with the\nDocker-based configurations when executing BasicSwap in an isolated environment.\nAdditionally, we have remedied a bug that was causing the DEX to sometimes fail\nto validate the Bitcoin snapshot against its corresponding public key.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nWe have seen significant progress in regards to updating the user interface this\nweek. A wide array of fixes, optimizations, and enhancements have been included,\nand the offer table has been restructured to be more comprehensive and\nuser-friendly. This adds to the current ongoing tasks, which are the following:\n\n * Integrating the new subfee feature to make coin withdrawals and offer posting\n   easier (no need to manually calculate fees) into the GUI.\n * Addition of a dark mode.\n * Addition of a \"simple\" mode for the GUI in which the user interface is\n   slimmed down. This aims at simplifying the user experience but still allowing\n   for more advanced options via a \"simple/advanced\" toggler.\n * Addition of a new price charting system. The current chart style will still\n   be available and it'll be possible to select which one you want to use via\n   the settings page.\n * Introduction of a wide variety of GUI improvements, tweaks, and changes based\n   on feedback from our beta testers.\n\nWe anticipate deploying the changes shortly, allowing all users to update their\nlocal BasicSwap instances and take advantage of the new features.\n\nYear 2022 in Recap ?\n2022 in Review and What’s Coming in 2023Taking a look back at all the progress\nmade in 2022 and a glimpse of the future.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/2022-in-review/]Earlier this week, we proudly published a\ncomprehensive overview of the year 2022 and a glimpse of what's to come in 2023\nand beyond. As we reflect back on the year, it is clear that it was an\nincredibly successful one for the project and we're incredibly excited to jump\nright into 2023. \n\nWhile BasicSwap's open beta launch was a major milestone, many releases,\nincluding 16 for Particl Core, 8 for Particl Desktop, and the launch of a brand\nnew light wallet (Particl Electrum), kept the ecosystem blazing with progress\nall throughout. \n\nBut be assured, the best is yet to come and we're extremely confident for what\nstands ahead of us!

Despite the Christmas and New Year's holiday season, our team has been\nable to make decent strides in all aspects of the project. \n\nLet us review the progress we have made this week.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nParticl Desktop 3.3 Now Live on TestnetParticl Desktop 3.3 is now live on\ntestnet for community testing!Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-3-now-live-on-testnet/]The\nlong-anticipated Particl Desktop 3.3 is now officially live on testnet as of\nthis past Sunday! \n\nWhile it mostly introduces back-end improvements, along with a few front-end\nchanges to accommodate for them, this update is necessary to lay the groundwork\nfor Particl's new development cycle, which is focused on making the project more\nmodular, open, and contributor-friendly.\n\nAs to provide more context to the above statement, the community recently posed\na question to Arnold Bansemer, Particl Desktop developer, inquiring as to\nwhether the team is considering the development of web or mobile versions of the\nmarketplace. This inquiry was prompted by the fact that the desktop version of\nthe marketplace may be perceived as too complex for consumer-level users.\n\n> \"Lite\" client is one of the deliverables intended behind the next development\ncycle. v3.3 was a necessary pre-emptive step though (...) Once the next\ndevelopment phase starts (which will be eased into after v3.3.'s release, while\nstill adding, and fixing, details to v3.3.0), things like lite clients and web\nusable wallets (while still keeping privacy preserved) and all these various UX\nrelated issues, are all intended to be addressed. — Arnold Bansemer\nIndeed, Particl's next development cycle is all about breaking down Particl's\napplications and components into open modules that facilitate greater\ncontributions and more efficient integration into user-friendly platforms. As a\nresult, the development of a web or mobile version of the marketplace, such as\nBasicSwap DEX, is a logical outcome of this major infrastructure upgrade.\n\nTo understand the scope of what this new cycle means for the project, we invite\nyou to read the following blog post carefully as it explains everything in great\ndetail: https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/\n\nParticl’s Next Evolutionary Leap ForwardLearn about the team’s new major\ndevelopment cycle and discover Particl’s upcoming open-source foundation for\nthe\ndevelopment and deployment of privacy-first dApps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/]Given the\nextensive changes introduced with this update, we are calling for your help to\ntest the new version and ensure that no bugs, issues, or unexpected behaviors\nappear as a result. We hope you will join us in this endeavor and help us make\nParticl the best it can be.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week, we have begun the process of preparing the necessary environments for\nthe development and testing of \"BasicSwap scripts\". \n\nThese scripts will provide traders and liquidity providers with the ability to\nautomate trading parameters and manage positions, resulting in a more\nuser-friendly experience with these processes.\n\nAt this time, it is difficult to predict how long it will take for these scripts\nto be ready, as it will depend on a variety of factors, such as the complexity\nof the desired features.\n\nTherefore, we are currently in the research phase, and we welcome any feedback\non which advanced trading features you would like to see implemented on\nBasicSwap DEX.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nIn regards to the user interface of BasicSwap, we're still working on the items\nenumerated our two previous weekly reports with good progress being made on all\nfronts.

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est. July, 2025\n * Implementation: Upon successful vote (75% approval rate with minimum quorum\n   of 20% of the total supply over 10,080 blocks) and subsequent hard fork.\n\nImpact\nIf approved, this change will:\n\n * Significantly reduce PART's inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%;\n * Reduce PART’s inflation rate by 0.5% every year until it reaches 1.0%;\n * Remove the network treasury;\n * Initiate a hard fork of the Particl blockchain.\n\nWe believe this proposal represents a positive step toward optimizing the\nParticl network's economic model while ensuring sustainable project development\nand incentivising our community to actively promote and grow the\nnetwork.Important: For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are\nrunning its latest version.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come.
