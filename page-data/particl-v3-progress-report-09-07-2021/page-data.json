This means making certain that all changes for the testnet release\n(and, after that, the mainnet release) are merged and included where they need\nto be.\n\nStyling of the New Community Governance Module\nWhile the new governance module is completed in terms of functionality, it's\ncurrently going through a styling phase (UI/UX) which should also be completed\nin the next few days.\n\nNote that the new governance module may have disabled buttons or functions for\nthis coming testnet round if the styling fixes are not completed by the time of\nreleasing the testnet. Regardless, the module will be entirely ready for Particl\nV3's mainnet release.\n\nTo Be Completed Next\nBuilding and Releasing the New Particl V3 on Testnet\nThe next item to  be completed is to release Particl V3 on testnet for what\nshould be its final round of community testing.\n\nAny New Particl V3 Bug\nAny reported bug from the new Particl V3 testnet build will get immediate\npriority to ensure the client is stable and ready for mainnet release as fast as\npossible.\n\nIf you encounter any issue while testing Particl V3, please report it to the\nGithub Issue page of the particl-desktop repository.

This is a very important milestone for Particl as the\nhardfork introduces various changes and re-enables the ability to conduct blind\nand anon transactions.\n\nThis blog post will summarize everything brought by the hardfork and provide an\nupdate on the claims submitted by users who had coins temporarily disabled.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Has Hardforked\nToday, on Monday the 12th of July, 2021, at 17:00 UTC, the Particl blockchain\nhas successfully hardforked. This event officially turns the page on the\nunfortunate exploit on the chain that led to the creation of fraudulent coins\nout of thin air.\n\nFor an overview of the exploit and its disclosure, please head over to this\nParticl News blog post [https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/].\nFor a summary of the solutions that have been deployed, please check out this\none [https://particl.news/roadmap-to-post-inflation-hardfork/].\n\n> Note: If your Particl Core node is not updated to Particl Core 0.19.2.12, then\nit means you are now staking on the wrong chain. Any staking reward earned on\nthe wrong chain won't count on the correct chain, and you won't be able to send\nor receive payments from other people. Updating to Particl Core 0.19.2.12 is\nmandatory.\nBlind and Anon Transactions Re-Enabled\nOne of the two main components of this hardfork is the re-enabling of blind and\nanon transactions. In addition, the hardfork also re-enables the majority of\nanon and blind balances that were temporarily disabled to stop the attacker from\ncausing further damage on the blockchain.\n\nIn other words, you can now freely make blind and anon transactions once again\nand use Particl Marketplace on Particl Desktop V2. The hardfork also enables\nParticl V3 to go live on mainnnet as it relies on blind and anon transactions.\nMore details on this very soon!\n\nRe-Enable Coins Using the Low Pass Filter\nIf you had coins on blind and/or anon balances when the vulnerability was\nannounced and fixed, then they have been temporarily disabled up until today. To\nre-enable them, the Particl team deployed a “low pass filter” which\nautomatically re-enables any output with 200 or fewer coins.\n\nTo re-enable temporarily disabled coins using the low pass filter, you will need\nto enter the following command, once for every disabled output, in your Particl\nclient’s debug window.\n\ndebugwallet {\\\"spend_frozen_output\\\":true}\n\nFor example, if you have 220 disabled coins separated into two 110 PART outputs,\nyou will need to enter the above command twice in a row. You need to use Particl\nCore 0.19.2.12 to successfully re-enable your coins.\n\nRe-Enable Coins Using the Manual Claim Process\nIf you have disabled blind and anon outputs that contain more than 200 coins,\nyou were required to manually submit a claim to the team to include it in the\nwhitelist. If that’s your case, and you’ve submitted a claim, then your outputs\nhave been whitelisted, and you can now spend them. To do just that, you will\nneed to follow the same step as with the low pass filter.\n\nFor every disabled output you have, you need to type in the following command.\n\ndebugwallet {\\\"spend_frozen_output\\\":true}\n\nFor example, if you have 1,000 coins that are currently disabled, spread into 4\noutputs of 250 PART each, you will need to type the above command 4 times. You\nneed to use Particl Core 0.19.2.12 to successfully re-enable your coins.\n\nManual Claim Process Update\nTo be as transparent as possible, we’d like to provide a full update on the\nmanual claim process and its impact on Particl’s circulating supply.\n\nThroughout the entire span of the claim process, a total of 12 claims have been\nsubmitted to the team. Each claim has been thoroughly inspected and audited. We\nare happy to say that all submitted claims appear legitimate and that none of\nthem traced back to fraudulent or suspicious outputs. The submitted claims\neither traced back to their public origin, were accompanied by a proof of\npurchase, or had the typical cryptography one would expect from legitimate\noutputs.\n\nFor this reason, all claims been approved by both the team and the community\ngroup of validators. This claim process results in an additional\n810,588.43967605 PART being added to the supply, bringing it to a current total\nof ~11,411,000 PART. This doesn’t take any coin re-enabled through the low pass\nfilter into account.\n\n> Note: Particl’s block explorer [https://explorer.particl.io/status] currently\ndisplays a smaller circulating supply value than what is stated above. That’s\nbecause it doesn’t see disabled coins from users who haven’t yet executed the\ncommand to re-enable them. Every time users manually re-enable their coins, the\nblock explorer will dynamically adjust its circulating supply value.\nNew Treasury Model is Live\nThe second principal component of this hardfork is the activation of Particl’s\nnew and decentralized treasury model, which provides the ecosystem with\nperpetual PART revenue. Check out this blog post\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/] for more details.\n\nDecentralized Treasury Model ProposalLearn more about the new CCS proposal to\nform a new decentralized treasury model to support the Particl ecosystem.Blog\ncryptoguard [https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/]As a\nresult of this successful hardfork, anyone can now submit funding requests on\nParticl’s CCS platform to fund and support initiatives that directly benefit the\necosystem. Any funding request has to be approved by Particl stakeholders\nthrough an on-chain vote for the funds to be allocated from the treasury.\n\nIf you want to submit a proposal, please head over to the CCS platform\n[https://ccs.particl.io/] and read the instructions provided on there.\n\nIncrease in Staking Rewards\nAs part of the new treasury model, staking rewards are also getting a bump.\nIndeed, as of today, Particl’s emission rate has increased from 2% per year to\n8%, with half of the rewards going directly into the Treasury Fund.\n\nThat means that, as an individual staker, your staking rewards double from 2%\nper year to a minimum of 4%. But, of course, the actual yield rewarded to you\nfrom staking PART varies depending on how many more PART coins are being staked\nby other people. If, for example, only 50% of all PART coins stake on the\nnetwork, then you can expect your annual returns to be closer to 8% than 4%. You\ncan use CryptoID’s useful extraction tool\n[https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/#!extraction] to track the percentage of all\nPART coins being staked by their owner.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Particl team would like to thank you all for your incredible support and\nunderstanding through this challenging series of events. As we officially turn\nthe page on the vulnerability exploit with the hardfork, the team is excited to\nmove forward once again and spend its time growing and promoting the Particl\necosystem.\n\nStay tuned as we near the mainnet release of Particl V3 and soon release a bunch\nof exciting news, including the new roadmap, on Particl News.\n\nWhat doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, and that’s precisely the case here.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

If that's the\ncase, there is nothing more for you to do, you're already all set!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s this Hardfork About?\nThis coming hardfork, scheduled for the 12th of July, 2021 at 17:00 UTC and\nactivated by Particl Core 0.19.2.12, has two primary purposes.\n\nRe-Enabling Temporarily Disabled Anon and Blind Balances\nParticl Vulnerability DisclosureLearn everything about Particl’s recent\nvulnerability discovery and emergency hardfork.Blogcryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/]The Particl team\nnoticed, in February 2021, a discrepancy between the expected and the observed\nsupply. Indeed, it was found that there were more coins in circulation than\nthere should.\n\nThe team immediately investigated the situation and discovered that an attacker\nhad exploited the chain. This allowed a hacker to create a certain number of\ncoins out of thin air to sell them on the trading markets. The bug that made\nthis possible was located and fixed in an emergency hardfork, leading to anon\nand blind balances being temporarily disabled.\n\nThe hardfork re-enables legitimate anon and blind balances while keeping\nexploited ones disabled.\n\nDecentralized Treasury Model Activation\nDecentralized Treasury Model ProposalLearn more about the new CCS proposal to\nform a new decentralized treasury model to support the Particl ecosystem.Blog\ncryptoguard [https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/]\nAdditionally, the Particl community recently approved a new treasury model to\nprovide the ecosystem with a decentralized and perpetual source of PART income.\nThis allows anyone to create and publish proposals on the CCS platform and get\ntheir initiative(s) funded if approved by the community through an on-chain\nvote.\n\nThe hardfork activates this new treasury model live on mainnet.\n\nWhat Do I Need To Do?\nTo successfully follow through the hardfork and land on the proper chain, all\nyou need to do is update your Particl Core node to 0.19.2.12.\n\nRelease Particl Core 0.19.2.12 · particl/particl-coreRelease\nNotes:https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019212Hashes8381f9a3f00c4515c32f87d9a66cc04ce3de2ad1aad95171e7c4cd99d91b46dc\nparticl-0.19.2.12-aarch...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.12] * Download\n   link: https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.12\n\nThis version is already live, as a full release, and you can download it\ndirectly on Github here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.12]. If you are\ncold staking using Particl’s cold staking application Partyman, simply enter\nthis command to update your node: cd ~/partyman && ./partyman update.\n\nOnce you’ve updated your node, you don’t need to do anything else. You’ll\nhardfork on the 12th of July, at 17:00 UTC, with the rest of the network. The\nhardfork is an entirely automatic process as long as you’re running the correct\ncore version.\n\nAnything Else Included in the Hardfork?\nThe two main items of this hardfork have been detailed in the first section of\nthis blog post, after the introduction. However, a few other minor items are\nincluded, which are available in the release notes of Particl Core 0.19.2.12.\nYou can simply follow this link\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019212] \nto get the full list of additions included in this release.\n\nMaking Particl V3’s Mainnet Release Possible\nAn important but indirect result of this hardfork is that it will make the\nmainnet release of Particl V3 possible. Indeed, Particl V3 cannot be released on\nmainnet up until the hardfork.\n\nThat’s because Particl Marketplace, which is hosted on the V3 desktop client,\nuses both anon and blind balances for various functions, including enabling\nescrow contracts and paying for listing fees. And because both anon and blind\nbalances are currently disabled, it is simply impossible to use the marketplace.\n\nAs the hardfork goes live, Particl Marketplace will, once again, be usable and\nthus able to be released on mainnet.\n\nAs an estimate, you can expect Particl V3 to go live on mainnet, roughly one\nweek after the hardfork. This short period between the hardfork and the V3\nrelease ensures optimal post-fork stability and that the launch goes on as\nsmoothly as possible.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe entire Particl team is immensely grateful to all of you in the community and\nwants to extend our thanks for your support and patience as we worked through\nthis unfortunate situation. With this event rapidly coming to an end, we are\nincredibly excited to turn the page and focus entirely on what will make the\nParticl ecosystem grow and get more adopted.\n\nFollowing the release of Particl V3 on mainnet, you can expect a brand new\npost-V3 roadmap to be released. It provides a strategic plan to grow the\necosystem and, equally as important, raise its level of adoption.\n\nWe cannot wait to share it with you all and bring the benefits of decentralized\ne-commerce to a broader-than-ever audience! So stay awesome, and let’s rock the\nmonths and years to come, together!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nMulti-Net Support ?\nMultinet by tecnovert · Pull Request #311 · basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
