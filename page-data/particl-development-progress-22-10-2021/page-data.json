This\nweek, work has continued on the previously identified items. Additionally,\nfollowing feedback from some of the vendors on the marketplace, there's been a\nfair bit of investigation on listing fees and to determine how they could be\nlowered.\n\nFurthermore, a new update to BasicSwap has been pushed, bringing it closer than\never to its open beta phase (more details on that further down below).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Development Progress\nThis week has been a continuation of last week's list of items. \n\nTo provide a bit of clarity, the team is currently working on the Particl\nDesktop 3.1 (or V3.1) release, which focuses on fixing any bug or issue\nidentified since the launch of Particl V3. It also will include a few feature\nimprovements (i.e., the items mentioned in the list below).\n\nParticl Desktop 3.1 is a supporting update for the Particl V3 release and is not\nintended to introduce any new major feature or functionality; that is instead\nplanned for Particl Desktop 3.2 and onward. \n\nHere's the short-term to-do list for Particl Desktop 3.1.\n\n * Update Particl Desktop and particl-market (marketplace codebase) to use\n   Particl Core 0.21. This task is currently in progress and is expected to be\n   completed very shortly.\n * A number of features related to better vendor inventory import/update, which\n   includes the provision of a product code (allowing for updates to items via\n   CSV amongst other things), the ability to update pricing via the batch\n   publish window, and the ability to import images through the CSV file\n   directly (with the possibility to specify the category and target market\n   directly from the CSV coming soon as well). This task is currently in\n   progress.\n * The usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace to allow for\n   better, more customizable formatting. This task has already been started but\n   has been put on pause until the above items are completed. It is estimated\n   that this item will be completed very quickly once its development resumes.\n * Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address\n   requirement (i.e., download links, NFTs, user codes, etc.). This task has not\n   been started yet.\n\nParticl Core Development Progress\nAs we prepare the grounds for the launch of the open beta phase for BasicSwap, a\nnew version for it has been pushed to the closed beta group and requires further\ntesting. This new version introduces a few new features (i.e., private swap\noffers, where users can send private offers that can only be seen by one other\nparticular user) and improves on various functionalities. \n\nAfter the new Particl.io website goes live on Tuesday, you can expect an\nofficial BasicSwap introduction to be the next big piece of communications on\nParticl News. This blog post will explain everything you need to know about\nBasicSwap and officially announce it as the next big item coming up for Particl.\n\nOther than that, an SMSG update has been scheduled for an upcoming Particl\nhardfork. It fixes a case where adjusting markteplace listing fees through \nsmsgfeetarget was ineffective. Investigations on reducing listing fees are\nongoing and additional updates to that effect may be included for the next\nhardfork (no scheduled date at this time, we will inform you when that is the\ncase). \n\nNew Particl Website\nAs mentioned earlier in this update and in yesterday's marketing article, the\nnew Particl.io website is going to go live this coming Tuesday the 26th of\nOctober. Be sure to be around on that day to check it out!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you for your support and passion! You are what makes this project! \n\nBe sure to be around next week for the grand reveal of the new Particl website\nand share it far and wide with people you know will resonate with the project's\nmission.\n\nAnd on that note, we wish you all a great weekend.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

В этой серии\nстатей будут разъясняться доступным для всех языком различные технические\nаспекты платформы Particl.  Cтатьи дадут вам хорошие базовые знания о\nтехническом функционировании платформы и в дальнейшем послужат путеводителем для\nобъяснения этих функции новому члену сообщества или пользователю платформы.\n\n. . .\n\n Для финансовых транзакций на платформе Particl используется конфиденциальная\nкриптовалюта PART с разными уровнями анонимности.  Пользователи могут выбирать\nмежду 3 типами транзакций (публичными, “слепыми”, анонимными), когда используют\nмонеты PART для платежей .  Каждый из этих типов транзакций обеспечивает\nопределенный уровень конфиденциальности и имеет свой собственный набор свойств.\nВ этой статье мы разберем все эти типы транзакций, расскажем о каждом подробно и\nобъясним для чего и когда вам нужно их использовать. Транзакции на платформе\nParticl перестанут быть чем-то неведомым для вас после прочтения!\n\nСодержание (нажмите для перехода)\n * Публичные транзакции (Public)\n * Blind/“Слепые” транзакции (CT)\n * Протокол Rangeproof\n * Протокол Bulletproof\n * Анонимные транзакции (Anon)\n * Кольцевые подписи (MLSAG)\n * Как создать анонимную транзакцию (RingCT) в приложении Particl\n * Обеспечение требуемого уровня конфиденциальности\n * Скрытые (Stealth) адреса\n * CT + RingCT вместе = бесконечные возможности\n\n\n\nПубличные транзакции\nПротокол: Bitcoin\n\nУровень конфиденциальности: низкий\n\nСтоимость транзакции: низкая (~ 0,000346 PART)Segwit: \n\nДа (снижает вес транзакций на ~20%)\n\nДоверенная установка: Нет\n\nПрограммируемые выходы: Да\n\nПо умолчанию все транзакции отправляются как «публичные транзакции», если вы не\nвыбрали протокол конфиденциальности чтобы скрыть ваши транзакции в блокчейне. И\nпоскольку Particl основан на кодовой базе Биткоин, то они записываются в\nблокчейн точно так же, как обычно записываются все транзакции Биткоин. \n\nПримечание.\n> Ядро Particl всегда своевременно обновляется в соответствии с последними\nверсиями ядра Биткоина. Таким образом, все исправления, улучшения безопасности и\nобновления ядра Биткоина также интегрируются и в ядро Particl.\n\n\n\n\n Биткойн не анонимен несмотря на то, что так утверждают многие. На самом деле\nвсё как раз наоборот. Биткоин-транзакции (а также публичные транзакции Particl)\nдовольно прозрачны, мы это называем псевдонимными транзакциями. Вместо привязки\nк идентификации личности каждая такая транзакция привязывается к псевдонимам\nсостоящих из различных чисел и символов, просто называемых адресами.    \nВозможно этого достаточно для защиты ваших данных от незаинтересованных сторон.\nОднако, появление надежных инструментов анализа блокчейна позволяет любой\nлюбопытной, либо мотивированной стороне начать копаться в блокчейне и\nотслеживать пользователей. Стало значительно проще связать такие\nадреса-псевдонимы с вашими идентификационными данными на бирже, в платежной\nсистеме, у продавца и т. п., когда вы совершаете платеж любому из них.По этой\nпричине команда Particl реализовала два дополнительных протокола для\nконфиденциальности, которые скрывают транзакции в блокчейне. Оба этих протокола\nне требуют каких-либо доверенных установок и решают одну и ту же общую задачу,\nно имеют разные цели на платформе Particl и разные уровни конфиденциальности.\n\nBlind/“слепые” транзакции\nПротокол: Confidential Transactions(СТ)\n\nУровень конфиденциальности: средний (суммы транзакций скрыты)\n\nСтоимость транзакции: средняя (~ 0,001962 PART)\n\nSegwit: Да (снижает вес транзакций CT на ~ 48%)\n\nBulletproofs: Да (уменьшает размер доказательств на ~ 70%)\n\nДоверенная установка: Нет\n\nПрограммируемые «выходы»: Да\n\nТехническая документация: \nhttps://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\n\n Blind/“слепыми” транзакциями называются те, суммы которых скрыты в блокчейне и\nизвестны только двум участникам сделки - отправителю и получателю. Этот тип\nтранзакции использует протокол конфиденциальности Confidential Transactions\n(CT).\n\n Данный протокол конфиденциальности не требует никакихдоверенных установок, и\nтакже  не требует помощи какого-либо посредника для обработки транзакций либо\nпрямого взаимодействия между сторонами транзакции. \n\nПримечание.\n> «доверенные установки» требуют одноразовой установки, которая включает создание\nи использование мастер-ключей. Таким образом, пользователям необходимо иметь\nопределенный кредит доверия к сгенерировавшему эти ключи, в том, что он\nуничтожит их сразу после завершения настройки протокола. В противном случае эти\nключи могут быть использованы для создания неограниченного количества монет и\nникто не смог бы этого заметить.\n\n\n\n\n Blind/“слепые” транзакции используют метод проверки с нулевым разглашением,\nчтобы криптографически гарантировать, что нельзя потратить больше монет чем\nдоступно. В частности, они используют метод, который называется\nкриптографическим доказательством диапазона (Rangeproof), который гарантирует,\nчто количество монет, отправленных в данной транзакции, находится между двумя\nзначениями.\n\nRangeproof\nRangeproof (криптографическое доказательство принадлежности к диапазону) - это\nкриптографический протокол, используемый для проверки того, что сумма платежа\nположительна либо равна нулю, но без фактического раскрытия самой суммы\nтранзакции. Без этих доказательств диапазона было бы возможно установить сумму\nтранзакции настолько большой, что это привело бы к отрицательным значениям, и\nтаким образом, позволило бы генерировать монеты из воздуха. Злоумышленник мог бы\nдобавлять потраченные или другие «выходы», генерируя дополнительные монеты.\nОтрицательный результат приведет к тому, что сумма отправки все равно будет\nравна нулю.    Обратной стороной доказательств диапазона является то, что они\nдовольно сильно утяжеляют блокчейн. Их размер зависит линейно от количества\nвыходов транзакции и битов в диапазоне доказательства. Из-за такой вот “тяжелой”\nприроды эти доказательства диапазона занимают большую часть общего размера\n Blind/“слепой” транзакции.   Эта неудобная реальность приводит к тому, что при\nиспользовании этого протокола транзакции имеют больший размер, чем обычные\nпубличные. Транзакция большего размера, кроме более высоких комиссий,  также\nприводит к тому, что и размер блокчейна экспоненциально растет по мере\nиспользования.  Таким образом, работа с более громоздким блокчейном становится\nвсе более и более неудобной по мере того, как в нем будет записано все больше и\nбольше транзакций CT.\n\nПримечание.\n> Эта проблема масштабируемости - одна из основных причин, по которым команда\nParticl задержала перенос своей реализации RingCT в основную сеть. Было решено\nподождать, пока будет найдено правильное решение этой проблемы масштабируемости,\nи тогда появились Bulletproofs.\n\n\n\n\nBulletproof\nТехническая документация: https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf\n\nОтчет по аудиту Quarkslab о реализации Bulletproofs в Particl: \nhttps://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\n\nBulletproofs - это новое поколение криптографических доказательств\nпринадлежности к диапазону, которое взвешивается скорее логарифмически чем\nлинейно. В тех. документации [https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf] они\nупоминаются как не-интерактивные короткие доказательства с нулевым разглашением.\nЕсли сказать проще, то Bulletproofs - это революционное улучшение по сравнению с\nобычными защитами диапазона типа Rangeproofs, поскольку их размер примерно на\n70% меньше. А так как именно защита диапазона составляет большую часть размера\nсамой транзакции CT, то это в той же мере снижает комиссии за транзакции и\nпространство, занимаемое транзакциями в блокчейне.\n\n\nЗабавный факт:\n> термин «Bulletproofs» придумал Shashank Agrawal, когда он описал новый тип\nдоказательства диапазона так: «краткий как пуля, но с пуленепробиваемой\nбезопасностью».\n\n\nАнонимные транзакции  (протокол RingCT)\nПротокол: RingCT\n\nУровень конфиденциальности: высокий (суммы транзакций и участники скрыты)\n\nСтоимость транзакции: от средней до высокой, в зависимости от количества\nпримесей, используемых в кольцевых подписях, или от размера колец.Стоимость\nтранзакции для настроек низкой конфиденциальности: ~ 0,003232 PART Стоимость\nтранзакции для настроек высокой конфиденциальности: ~ 0,009032 PART\n\nSegwit: Да (снижает вес транзакции ~ 47%)\n\nBulletproofs: Да (уменьшает размер rangeproofs на ~ 70%)\n\nДоверенная установка: Нет\n\nПрограммируемые «выходы»: Нет\n\nТехническая документация: https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf\n\n Анонимные транзакции, или как они называются в Particl Desktop - транзакции\nAnon, выводят конфиденциальность на новый уровень, так как скрывают не только\nпереводимые суммы, но также и личности участников транзакции (отправителя и\nполучателя). Для транзакций этого типа используется протокол конфиденциальности\nRingCT, ставший популярным благодаря Monero, но адаптированный командой Particl\nдля работы с кодовой базой Биткоина. Это позволяет платформе получить\nпреимущества ведущего в отрасли протокола конфиденциальности RingCT, но при этом\nтакже использовать безопасность и стабильность от сообщества разработчиков\nБиткоина. Другими словами, RingCT на базе кода Биткоина - это все равно как не\nпросто иметь торт, а таки его и съесть. Хорошее без плохого.\n\n Хорошие примеры вышесказанного заключаются в возможности использования RingCT с\nпомощью специальных скриптов в атомарных свопах, в децентрализованных\nприложениях(таких как Particl Marketplace), в протоколе Lightning Network, и т.\nп. Это также позволяет связать RingCT напрямую с транзакциями CT, что поможет\nдостичь полной программируемости- мы это рассмотрим позже в этой статье.Так же,\nкак и Blind/“слепые” транзакции, использующие протокол CT, анонимные транзакции \nне требуют доверия и не полагаются на какие-либо доверенные установки. Нужно\nотметить, что транзакции RingCT также немного больше чем конфиденциальные\nтранзакции(СТ), но не намного. Это из-за добавления в микс кольцевых подписей\n(MLSAG).\n\n\nИнтересный факт:\n> изначально RingCT был реализован поверх кодовой базы Cryptonote (Monero).\nКоманда Particl была первой, кто когда-либо разработал индивидуальную\nреализацию, которая могла бы работать с любой другой кодовой базой, в данном\nслучае с кодовой базой Биткоин.\n\n\n\nКольцевые подписи (MLSAG)\nОтчет об аудите Quarkslab о реализации MLSAG в Particl: \nhttps://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\n\n Многоуровневые связываемые спонтанные специальные групповые подписи\n(Multilayered Linkable Spontaneous Ad-Hoc Group Signatures - MLSAG), или — так\nназываемые кольцевые подписи, являются ключевой частью RingCT. Это такой тип\nцифровой подписи, которая выполняется одновременно многими «выходами» в рамках\nопределенной группы RingCT выходов (представленных балансами Anon на Particl\nDesktop). В этом случае ни один наблюдатель не может сказать какой именно из\nучаствующих «выходов» в этой подписи фактически подписывает и отправляет\nтранзакцию.\n\n\nВикипедия описывает кольцевые подписи так:\n> «Кольцева́я по́дпись (англ. ring signature) — вариант реализации электронной\nподписи, при котором известно, что сообщение подписано одним из членов списка\nпотенциальных подписантов, но не раскрывается, кем именно. Подписант\nсамостоятельно формирует список из произвольного числа различных лиц, включая в\nнего и себя. Для наложения подписи подписывающему не требуются разрешение,\nсодействие или помощь со стороны включённых в список лиц — используются только\nоткрытые ключи всех членов списка и закрытый ключ лишь самого подписывающего»\n\n\n\nОдним из свойств безопасности кольцевой подписи является то, что путем\nвычислений невозможно определить чей именно ключ из членов группы был\nиспользован для создания подписи. В случае RingCT цифровая подпись,\nиспользованная для выполнения транзакции, могла исходить от любого члена\nкольцевой группы. Пользователи помещают часть своих средств на баланс Anon.\nСредства, находящиеся на балансе Anon, используются для выполнения RingCT\nтранзакций. Протокол анонимно подписывает транзакцию перед ее выполнением, \nиспользуя другие имеющиеся на блокчейне Анон «выходы» в качестве отвлекающих\nприманок, и таким образом создает подпись, которая при проверке выглядит так,\nкак будто бы она могла быть инициирована любым из владельцев выходов RingCT,\nиспользуемых кольцевой группой. В итоге невозможно узнать, кто именно совершил\nэту транзакцию, потому что это мог быть кто угодно из тех, чьи «выходы»\nиспользовались кольцевой группой в качестве приманок.\nЭто эффективно анонимизирует все данные, содержащиеся в транзакции —\nпередаваемую сумму, а также отправителя и получателя транзакции. Это также дает\nучастникам сделки очень веские правдоподобные основания для отрицания (1\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability], 2\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption]).\n\nКак создать анонимную транзакцию (RingCT) в Particl Desktop\n\nВ Particl Desktop можно выбрать количество участников для кольцевой группы, т.е.\nложных подписантов,  которое вы собираетесь использовать для анонимизации своих\nтранзакций. В клиентском приложении этот называется: NO. OF RING SIGS.Это\nозначает простую вещь: для каждого вашего входа, задействованного для генерации\nвашей транзакции, будет использоваться некоторое количество других выходов для\nсоздания цифровой подписи, и это может быть подписано любым из 24 участников\n(например). Значение 24 выбрано на скриншоте чуть выше. Это означает, что для\nмаскировки транзакции будут использованы 23 чужих «выходов» в качестве\nотвлекающих приманок плюс реальный «выход» отправителья транзакции. В случае\nесли транзакция использует больше чем 1 «выход» отправителья, например 3\n«выхода», то это означает, что для выполнения транзакции будут сгенерированы 3\nкольцевых подписей, по одной для каждого  «выхода», с 24 участниками в каждой!\nЭто может показаться слишком сложным, но не волнуйтесь - Particl Desktop сделает\nвсе это за вас, сделает отправку транзакций RingCT такой же легкой, как любой\nдругой транзакции.\nЧтобы создать транзакцию RingCT: просто перейдите на вкладку «Send/Convert»,\nвыберите тип транзакции «Anon», затем кликните «Advanced Options»\n(дополнительные параметры) и двигайте ползунок уровня конфиденциальности (NO. OF\nRING SIGS), который отображается в нижнем левом углу страницы. Выбранное вами\nзначение будет равно количеству участников кольца в вашей кольцевой группе . Но\nвы можете и не трогать ползунок, оставив уровень конфиденциальности по умолчанию\n(24 участников кольца). Это будет хороший баланс между конфиденциальностью и\nстоимостью.\n\n\nПримечание.\n> Чем больше «выходов» и ложных подписантов используется для транзакции RingCT -\nтем дороже она становится, но также - тем более конфиденциальной она получится.\nЕсли вас не волнует стоимость транзакции и вы хотите получить лишь максимальную\nконфиденциальность - создавайте транзакции с максимально возможным количеством\nучастников кольца и с максимально возможным количеством входов.\n\n\n\n\nПоддержание хорошего уровня конфиденциальности\n Как общее правило, в теории и практически, RingCT становится тем более\nконфиденциальным, чем больше людей конвертируют свои публичные балансы в балансы\nAnon, тем самым создавая больше «выходов» Anon, которые будут доступны к\nиспользованию кольцевыми группами для транзакций RingCT. Это потому, что RingCT\nполагается на «выходы» других людей, чтобы правдоподобно отрицать какой из\nвыходов на самом деле подписал транзакцию, и чем больше имеется выходов RingCT\nдля подписи транзакций - тем сильнее становится аспект конфиденциальности и\nправдоподобного отрицания.Но, хотя «выходы» выбираются из любых выходов Anon в\nцепи случайным образом, все же чаще всего они выбираются из самых последних\nтранзакций RingCT. Причина, по которой протокол работает таким образом,\nзаключается в ответе на этот исследовательский документ\n[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/], который демонстрирует, что реальными\nвходами можно считать те, которые самые свежие, а все приманки находятся намного\nглубже в цепи т.е. старые и долгое время не использовались в транзакциях.\nИсходя из этого, рекомендуется чтобы все пользователи держали хотя бы часть\nсредств на балансе Anon т.е. Анон «выходах», которые могут быть автоматически\nиспользованы сетью (разумеется, бесплатно для пользователей) в Анон транзакциях.\nКроме того, рекомендуется чтобы пользователи совершали как можно больше\nтранзакций Anon, и это могло бы способствовать повышению конфиденциальности всей\nсети. Обратите внимание, что не обязательные требования для выполнения\nтранзакции RingCT, но чем больше людей будут это делать, тем сильнее и\nустойчивее сеть становится для всех.\nParticl Marketplace использует по умолчанию именно транзакции RingCT для всех\nтранзакций на торговой площадке. Таким образом, каждый новый пользователь\nторговой площадки будет добавлять новые транзакции anon в блокчейн, используя\nанонимные транзакции для каждой своей покупки или продажи.  Другими словами,\nпользователям платформы Particl не нужно делать ничего особенного кроме этого.\nТак как рост количества анонимных транзакций  и размер анонимного пула прямо\nсвязаны с ростом торговой площадки Particl. По мере роста ее использования\nтранзакции RingCT будут становиться  все более и более запутанными сравнительно\nс  другими блокчейнами, использующими технологию RingCT.\n\nСкрытые адреса\n Скрытые адреса - это специальные адреса, которые можно генерировать как\n«одноразовые адреса приема».  Под «адресом одноразового приема» подразумевается\n что каждый раз, когда отправитель использовал этот адрес для отправки некоторых\nмонет, то создается новый адрес для следующей отправки/получения. На самом деле,\nна скрытый адрес можно получать платежи несколько раз, но все эти платежи будут\nпопадать на разные «выходы», принадлежащие владельцу скрытого адреса. Это\nувеличивают конфиденциальность, потому что только владелец скрытого адреса может\nопределить, принадлежит ли выход ему или нет. Не зная приватного ключа адреса,\nнаблюдатель не сможет связать и угадать, какие  «выходы» и с каким скрытым\nадресом связаны даже если знает скрытые адреса. Это помогает в защите получателя\nтранзакции от идентификации.\nОдних лишь скрытых адресов не достаточно для защиты информации о транзакциях от\nхорошо финансируемого и мотивированного наблюдателя (например, государственного\nучреждения), но в комбинации с более сильными протоколами конфиденциальности,\nтакими как CT или RingCT, они обеспечивают еще один уровень конфиденциальности\nдля пользователя. На данный момент Blind/“слепые” (CT) и анонимные (RingCT)\nтранзакции могут выполняться только на скрытые адреса.\n\nCT + RingCT вместе = бесконечные возможности\n У обоих протоколов конфиденциальности есть свои плюсы и минусы, но одним из\nсамых заметных различий между этими двумя реализациями Particl является то, что\nу CT есть программируемые «выходы», а у RingCT - нет. Это значит, что RingCT,\nкак есть, не может использоваться в смарт-контрактах. Но это не означает, что\nего нельзя использовать в децентрализованных приложениях.  Как же это возможно,\nесли RingCT нельзя использовать в смарт-контрактах? Это одна из главных причин,\nпочему Particl сохранил в своей сети оба протокола, CT и RingCT, вместо того\nчтобы оставить только один из них. Поскольку транзакции CT имеют программируемые\nвыходы, то их можно использовать в смарт-контрактах, а затем легко связать с\nтранзакциями RingCT.  Прелесть решения Particl заключается в том, что выходы\nмогут быть отправлены с RingCT на CT для дальнейшей програмной обработки\n(например, для создания эскроу контракта), а затем так же отправлены обратно в\nRingCT. Лучшим примером, иллюстрирующим эту концепцию, является Particl\n Marketplace. Это конфиденциальная по умолчанию торговая площадка , которая \nиспользует RingCT для полной анонимизации всех транзакций. Но мало кто знает,\nчто на самом деле для своей системы условного депонирования торговая площадка\nиспользует комбинацию RingCT и CT, а не один лишь RingCT. Это потому, что\nсистема условного депонирования основана на функциональности смарт-контракта и,\nтаким образом, транзакции должны иметь программируемые выходы, следовательно\nиспользуется CT. Однако для взаимодействия со смарт-контрактом и сохранения\nанонимности пользователи отправляют ему транзакцию RingCT, которая затем\nавтоматически преобразуется торговой площадкой в транзакцию CT на время\nусловного депонирования.

На самом деле всё как раз наоборот. Биткоин-транзакции (а также публичные транзакции Particl) довольно прозрачны, мы это называем <strong>псевдонимными </strong>транзакциями. Вместо привязки к идентификации личности каждая такая транзакция привязывается к псевдонимам состоящих из различных чисел и символов, просто называемых адресами.     Возможно этого достаточно для защиты ваших данных от незаинтересованных сторон. Однако, появление надежных инструментов анализа блокчейна позволяет любой любопытной, либо мотивированной стороне начать копаться в блокчейне и отслеживать пользователей. Стало значительно проще связать такие адреса-псевдонимы с вашими идентификационными данными на бирже, в платежной системе, у продавца и т. п., когда вы совершаете платеж любому из них.По этой причине команда Particl реализовала два дополнительных протокола для конфиденциальности, которые скрывают транзакции в блокчейне.

В частности, они используют метод, который называется криптографическим доказательством диапазона (<strong><u><a href=\"#rangeproof\">Rangeproof</a></u></strong>), который гарантирует, что количество монет, отправленных в данной транзакции, находится между двумя значениями.</p><h3 id=\"rangeproof\">Rangeproof</h3><p>Rangeproof (криптографическое доказательство принадлежности к диапазону) - это криптографический протокол, используемый <strong>для проверки того, что сумма платежа положительна либо равна нулю</strong>, <strong>но без фактического раскрытия самой суммы транзакции</strong>. Без этих доказательств диапазона было бы возможно установить сумму транзакции настолько большой, что это привело бы к отрицательным значениям, и таким образом, позволило бы генерировать монеты из воздуха. Злоумышленник мог бы добавлять потраченные или другие «выходы», генерируя дополнительные монеты. Отрицательный результат приведет к тому, что сумма отправки все равно будет равна нулю.    Обратной стороной доказательств диапазона является то, что они довольно сильно утяжеляют блокчейн. Их размер зависит линейно от количества выходов транзакции и битов в диапазоне доказательства. Из-за такой вот “тяжелой” природы<strong> эти доказательства диапазона занимают большую часть общего размера  Blind/“слепой” транзакции</strong>.   Эта неудобная реальность приводит к тому, что при использовании этого протокола транзакции имеют больший размер, чем обычные публичные. Транзакция большего размера, кроме более высоких комиссий,  также приводит к тому, что и размер блокчейна экспоненциально растет по мере использования.  Таким образом, работа с более громоздким блокчейном становится все более и более неудобной по мере того, как в нем будет записано все больше и больше транзакций CT.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h6 id=\"\"><em>Примечание.</em></h6>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Эта проблема масштабируемости - одна из основных причин, по которым команда Particl задержала перенос своей реализации RingCT в основную сеть.

В случае RingCT цифровая подпись, использованная для выполнения транзакции, могла исходить от любого члена кольцевой группы. Пользователи помещают часть своих средств на баланс Anon. Средства, находящиеся на балансе Anon, используются для выполнения RingCT транзакций. Протокол анонимно подписывает транзакцию перед ее выполнением, <strong>используя другие имеющиеся на блокчейне Анон «выходы» в качестве отвлекающих приманок</strong>, и таким образом создает подпись, которая при проверке выглядит так, как будто бы она могла быть инициирована любым из владельцев выходов RingCT, используемых кольцевой группой. В итоге <strong>невозможно узнать, кто именно совершил эту транзакцию, потому что это мог быть кто угодно из тех, чьи «выходы» использовались кольцевой группой в качестве приманок.</strong><br>   <strong> Это эффективно анонимизирует все данные, содержащиеся в транзакции </strong>— передаваемую сумму, а также отправителя и получателя транзакции.

В клиентском приложении этот называется: <strong><em><u>NO. OF RING SIGS</u></em></strong>.Это означает простую вещь: <strong>для каждого вашего входа, задействованного для генерации вашей транзакции, будет использоваться некоторое количество других выходов для создания цифровой подписи, и это может быть подписано любым из 24 участников (например)</strong>. Значение 24 выбрано на скриншоте чуть выше. Это означает, что для маскировки транзакции будут использованы 23 чужих «выходов» в качестве отвлекающих приманок плюс реальный «выход» отправителья транзакции. В случае если транзакция использует больше чем 1 «выход» отправителья, например 3 «выхода», то это означает, что для выполнения транзакции будут сгенерированы 3 кольцевых подписей, по одной для каждого  «выхода», с 24 участниками в каждой! Это может показаться слишком сложным, но не волнуйтесь - Particl Desktop сделает все это за вас, сделает отправку транзакций RingCT такой же легкой, как любой другой транзакции.<br><strong>Чтобы создать транзакцию RingCT:</strong> просто перейдите на вкладку «Send/Convert», выберите тип транзакции «Anon», затем кликните «Advanced Options» (дополнительные параметры) и двигайте ползунок уровня конфиденциальности (NO. OF RING SIGS), который отображается в нижнем левом углу страницы. Выбранное вами значение будет равно количеству участников кольца в вашей кольцевой группе . Но вы можете и не трогать ползунок, оставив уровень конфиденциальности по умолчанию (24 участников кольца). Это будет хороший баланс между конфиденциальностью и стоимостью.<br></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h6 id=\"\"><em>Примечание.</em></h6>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Чем больше «выходов» и ложных подписантов используется для транзакции RingCT - тем дороже она становится, но также - тем более конфиденциальной она получится.

Это потому, что RingCT полагается на «выходы» других людей<strong>, </strong>чтобы правдоподобно отрицать какой из выходов на самом деле подписал транзакцию, и <strong>чем больше имеется выходов RingCT для подписи транзакций - тем сильнее становится аспект конфиденциальности и правдоподобного отрицания.</strong>Но, хотя «выходы» выбираются из любых выходов Anon в цепи случайным образом, все же чаще всего они выбираются из самых последних транзакций RingCT. Причина, по которой протокол работает таким образом, заключается в ответе на этот <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"><strong><u>исследовательский документ</u></strong></a>, который демонстрирует, что реальными входами можно считать те, которые самые свежие, а все приманки находятся намного глубже в цепи т.е. старые и долгое время не использовались в транзакциях.<br>Исходя из этого, <strong>рекомендуется чтобы все пользователи держали хотя бы часть средств на балансе Anon</strong> т.е. Анон «выходах», которые могут быть автоматически использованы сетью (разумеется, бесплатно для пользователей) в Анон транзакциях. Кроме того, <strong>рекомендуется чтобы пользователи совершали как можно больше транзакций Anon</strong>, и это могло бы способствовать повышению конфиденциальности всей сети. Обратите внимание, что не обязательные требования для выполнения транзакции RingCT, но чем больше людей будут это делать, тем сильнее и устойчивее сеть становится для всех.<br>Particl Marketplace использует по умолчанию именно транзакции RingCT для всех транзакций на торговой площадке. Таким образом, каждый новый пользователь торговой площадки будет добавлять новые транзакции anon в блокчейн, используя анонимные транзакции для каждой своей покупки или продажи.  Другими словами, пользователям платформы Particl не нужно делать ничего особенного кроме этого. Так как рост количества анонимных транзакций  и размер анонимного пула прямо связаны с ростом торговой площадки Particl. По мере роста ее использования транзакции RingCT будут становиться  все более и более запутанными сравнительно с  другими блокчейнами, использующими технологию RingCT.</p><h3 id=\"--3\">Скрытые адреса</h3><p> Скрытые адреса - это специальные адреса, которые можно генерировать как «одноразовые адреса приема».  Под «адресом одноразового приема» подразумевается  что каждый раз, когда отправитель использовал этот адрес для отправки некоторых монет, то создается новый адрес для следующей отправки/получения. На самом деле, на скрытый адрес можно получать платежи несколько раз, но все эти платежи будут попадать на разные «выходы», принадлежащие владельцу скрытого адреса. Это увеличивают конфиденциальность, потому что <strong>только владелец скрытого адреса может определить, принадлежит ли выход ему или нет.</strong> Не зная приватного ключа адреса, наблюдатель не сможет связать и угадать, какие  «выходы» и с каким скрытым адресом связаны даже если знает скрытые адреса. Это <strong>помогает в защите получателя транзакции от идентификации</strong>.<br>Одних лишь скрытых адресов не достаточно для защиты информации о транзакциях от хорошо финансируемого и мотивированного наблюдателя (например, государственного учреждения), но в комбинации с более сильными протоколами конфиденциальности, такими как CT или RingCT, они обеспечивают еще один уровень конфиденциальности для пользователя. <strong>На данный момент</strong> <strong>Blind/“слепые” (CT) и анонимные (RingCT) транзакции могут выполняться только на скрытые адреса.</strong></p><h3 id=\"ct-ringct-\">CT + RingCT вместе = бесконечные возможности</h3><p> У обоих протоколов конфиденциальности есть свои плюсы и минусы, но одним из самых заметных различий между этими двумя реализациями Particl является то, что у CT есть программируемые «выходы», а у RingCT - нет. Это значит, что RingCT, как есть, не может использоваться в смарт-контрактах. Но это <strong>не означает</strong>, что его нельзя использовать в децентрализованных приложениях.  Как же это возможно, если RingCT нельзя использовать в смарт-контрактах? <strong>Это одна из главных причин, почему Particl сохранил в своей сети оба протокола, CT и RingCT, вместо того чтобы оставить только один из них</strong>. Поскольку транзакции CT имеют программируемые выходы, то их можно использовать в смарт-контрактах, а затем легко связать с транзакциями RingCT.  Прелесть решения Particl заключается в том, что выходы могут быть отправлены с RingCT на CT для дальнейшей програмной обработки (например, для создания эскроу контракта), а затем так же отправлены обратно в RingCT. Лучшим примером, иллюстрирующим эту концепцию, является Particl  Marketplace. Это <strong>конфиденциальная по умолчанию торговая площадка </strong>, которая <strong>использует RingCT для полной анонимизации всех транзакций</strong>. Но мало кто знает, что на самом деле для своей системы условного депонирования торговая площадка использует комбинацию RingCT и CT, а не один лишь RingCT. Это потому, что система условного депонирования основана на функциональности смарт-контракта и, таким образом, транзакции должны иметь программируемые выходы, следовательно используется CT.

На самом деле всё как раз наоборот. Биткоин-транзакции (а также публичные транзакции Particl) довольно прозрачны, мы это называем <strong>псевдонимными </strong>транзакциями. Вместо привязки к идентификации личности каждая такая транзакция привязывается к псевдонимам состоящих из различных чисел и символов, просто называемых адресами.     Возможно этого достаточно для защиты ваших данных от незаинтересованных сторон. Однако, появление надежных инструментов анализа блокчейна позволяет любой любопытной, либо мотивированной стороне начать копаться в блокчейне и отслеживать пользователей. Стало значительно проще связать такие адреса-псевдонимы с вашими идентификационными данными на бирже, в платежной системе, у продавца и т. п., когда вы совершаете платеж любому из них.По этой причине команда Particl реализовала два дополнительных протокола для конфиденциальности, которые скрывают транзакции в блокчейне.

Без этих доказательств диапазона было бы возможно установить сумму транзакции настолько большой, что это привело бы к отрицательным значениям, и таким образом, позволило бы генерировать монеты из воздуха. Злоумышленник мог бы добавлять потраченные или другие «выходы», генерируя дополнительные монеты. Отрицательный результат приведет к тому, что сумма отправки все равно будет равна нулю.    Обратной стороной доказательств диапазона является то, что они довольно сильно утяжеляют блокчейн. Их размер зависит линейно от количества выходов транзакции и битов в диапазоне доказательства. Из-за такой вот “тяжелой” природы<strong> эти доказательства диапазона занимают большую часть общего размера  Blind/“слепой” транзакции</strong>.   Эта неудобная реальность приводит к тому, что при использовании этого протокола транзакции имеют больший размер, чем обычные публичные. Транзакция большего размера, кроме более высоких комиссий,  также приводит к тому, что и размер блокчейна экспоненциально растет по мере использования.  Таким образом, работа с более громоздким блокчейном становится все более и более неудобной по мере того, как в нем будет записано все больше и больше транзакций CT.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h6 id=\"\"><em>Примечание.</em></h6>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Эта проблема масштабируемости - одна из основных причин, по которым команда Particl задержала перенос своей реализации RingCT в основную сеть.

В случае RingCT цифровая подпись, использованная для выполнения транзакции, могла исходить от любого члена кольцевой группы. Пользователи помещают часть своих средств на баланс Anon. Средства, находящиеся на балансе Anon, используются для выполнения RingCT транзакций. Протокол анонимно подписывает транзакцию перед ее выполнением, <strong>используя другие имеющиеся на блокчейне Анон «выходы» в качестве отвлекающих приманок</strong>, и таким образом создает подпись, которая при проверке выглядит так, как будто бы она могла быть инициирована любым из владельцев выходов RingCT, используемых кольцевой группой. В итоге <strong>невозможно узнать, кто именно совершил эту транзакцию, потому что это мог быть кто угодно из тех, чьи «выходы» использовались кольцевой группой в качестве приманок.</strong><br>   <strong> Это эффективно анонимизирует все данные, содержащиеся в транзакции </strong>— передаваемую сумму, а также отправителя и получателя транзакции.

В клиентском приложении этот называется: <strong><em><u>NO. OF RING SIGS</u></em></strong>.Это означает простую вещь: <strong>для каждого вашего входа, задействованного для генерации вашей транзакции, будет использоваться некоторое количество других выходов для создания цифровой подписи, и это может быть подписано любым из 24 участников (например)</strong>. Значение 24 выбрано на скриншоте чуть выше. Это означает, что для маскировки транзакции будут использованы 23 чужих «выходов» в качестве отвлекающих приманок плюс реальный «выход» отправителья транзакции. В случае если транзакция использует больше чем 1 «выход» отправителья, например 3 «выхода», то это означает, что для выполнения транзакции будут сгенерированы 3 кольцевых подписей, по одной для каждого  «выхода», с 24 участниками в каждой! Это может показаться слишком сложным, но не волнуйтесь - Particl Desktop сделает все это за вас, сделает отправку транзакций RingCT такой же легкой, как любой другой транзакции.<br><strong>Чтобы создать транзакцию RingCT:</strong> просто перейдите на вкладку «Send/Convert», выберите тип транзакции «Anon», затем кликните «Advanced Options» (дополнительные параметры) и двигайте ползунок уровня конфиденциальности (NO. OF RING SIGS), который отображается в нижнем левом углу страницы. Выбранное вами значение будет равно количеству участников кольца в вашей кольцевой группе . Но вы можете и не трогать ползунок, оставив уровень конфиденциальности по умолчанию (24 участников кольца). Это будет хороший баланс между конфиденциальностью и стоимостью.<br></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h6 id=\"\"><em>Примечание.</em></h6>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Чем больше «выходов» и ложных подписантов используется для транзакции RingCT - тем дороже она становится, но также - тем более конфиденциальной она получится. Если вас не волнует стоимость транзакции и вы хотите получить лишь максимальную конфиденциальность - создавайте транзакции с максимально возможным количеством участников кольца и с максимально возможным количеством входов.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p></p><h3 id=\"--2\">Поддержание хорошего уровня конфиденциальности</h3><p>  Как общее правило, в теории и практически, <strong>RingCT становится тем более конфиденциальным, чем больше людей конвертируют свои публичные балансы в балансы Anon, </strong>тем самым создавая больше «выходов» Anon, которые будут доступны к использованию кольцевыми группами для транзакций RingCT. Это потому, что RingCT полагается на «выходы» других людей<strong>, </strong>чтобы правдоподобно отрицать какой из выходов на самом деле подписал транзакцию, и <strong>чем больше имеется выходов RingCT для подписи транзакций - тем сильнее становится аспект конфиденциальности и правдоподобного отрицания.</strong>Но, хотя «выходы» выбираются из любых выходов Anon в цепи случайным образом, все же чаще всего они выбираются из самых последних транзакций RingCT. Причина, по которой протокол работает таким образом, заключается в ответе на этот <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\"><strong><u>исследовательский документ</u></strong></a>, который демонстрирует, что реальными входами можно считать те, которые самые свежие, а все приманки находятся намного глубже в цепи т.е. старые и долгое время не использовались в транзакциях.<br>Исходя из этого, <strong>рекомендуется чтобы все пользователи держали хотя бы часть средств на балансе Anon</strong> т.е. Анон «выходах», которые могут быть автоматически использованы сетью (разумеется, бесплатно для пользователей) в Анон транзакциях. Кроме того, <strong>рекомендуется чтобы пользователи совершали как можно больше транзакций Anon</strong>, и это могло бы способствовать повышению конфиденциальности всей сети. Обратите внимание, что не обязательные требования для выполнения транзакции RingCT, но чем больше людей будут это делать, тем сильнее и устойчивее сеть становится для всех.<br>Particl Marketplace использует по умолчанию именно транзакции RingCT для всех транзакций на торговой площадке. Таким образом, каждый новый пользователь торговой площадки будет добавлять новые транзакции anon в блокчейн, используя анонимные транзакции для каждой своей покупки или продажи.  Другими словами, пользователям платформы Particl не нужно делать ничего особенного кроме этого. Так как рост количества анонимных транзакций  и размер анонимного пула прямо связаны с ростом торговой площадки Particl. По мере роста ее использования транзакции RingCT будут становиться  все более и более запутанными сравнительно с  другими блокчейнами, использующими технологию RingCT.</p><h3 id=\"--3\">Скрытые адреса</h3><p> Скрытые адреса - это специальные адреса, которые можно генерировать как «одноразовые адреса приема».  Под «адресом одноразового приема» подразумевается  что каждый раз, когда отправитель использовал этот адрес для отправки некоторых монет, то создается новый адрес для следующей отправки/получения. На самом деле, на скрытый адрес можно получать платежи несколько раз, но все эти платежи будут попадать на разные «выходы», принадлежащие владельцу скрытого адреса. Это увеличивают конфиденциальность, потому что <strong>только владелец скрытого адреса может определить, принадлежит ли выход ему или нет.</strong> Не зная приватного ключа адреса, наблюдатель не сможет связать и угадать, какие  «выходы» и с каким скрытым адресом связаны даже если знает скрытые адреса. Это <strong>помогает в защите получателя транзакции от идентификации</strong>.<br>Одних лишь скрытых адресов не достаточно для защиты информации о транзакциях от хорошо финансируемого и мотивированного наблюдателя (например, государственного учреждения), но в комбинации с более сильными протоколами конфиденциальности, такими как CT или RingCT, они обеспечивают еще один уровень конфиденциальности для пользователя. <strong>На данный момент</strong> <strong>Blind/“слепые” (CT) и анонимные (RingCT) транзакции могут выполняться только на скрытые адреса.</strong></p><h3 id=\"ct-ringct-\">CT + RingCT вместе = бесконечные возможности</h3><p> У обоих протоколов конфиденциальности есть свои плюсы и минусы, но одним из самых заметных различий между этими двумя реализациями Particl является то, что у CT есть программируемые «выходы», а у RingCT - нет. Это значит, что RingCT, как есть, не может использоваться в смарт-контрактах. Но это <strong>не означает</strong>, что его нельзя использовать в децентрализованных приложениях.  Как же это возможно, если RingCT нельзя использовать в смарт-контрактах? <strong>Это одна из главных причин, почему Particl сохранил в своей сети оба протокола, CT и RingCT, вместо того чтобы оставить только один из них</strong>. Поскольку транзакции CT имеют программируемые выходы, то их можно использовать в смарт-контрактах, а затем легко связать с транзакциями RingCT.  Прелесть решения Particl заключается в том, что выходы могут быть отправлены с RingCT на CT для дальнейшей програмной обработки (например, для создания эскроу контракта), а затем так же отправлены обратно в RingCT. Лучшим примером, иллюстрирующим эту концепцию, является Particl  Marketplace. Это <strong>конфиденциальная по умолчанию торговая площадка </strong>, которая <strong>использует RingCT для полной анонимизации всех транзакций</strong>. Но мало кто знает, что на самом деле для своей системы условного депонирования торговая площадка использует комбинацию RingCT и CT, а не один лишь RingCT. Это потому, что система условного депонирования основана на функциональности смарт-контракта и, таким образом, транзакции должны иметь программируемые выходы, следовательно используется CT. Однако для взаимодействия со смарт-контрактом и сохранения анонимности пользователи отправляют ему транзакцию RingCT, которая затем автоматически преобразуется торговой площадкой в транзакцию CT на время условного депонирования. После удачной сделки покупатель разблокирует/открывает эскроу и транзакция завершается, как транзакция RingCT.<br> </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>\n<p><em>«Выход RingCT преобразуется в выход CT, который, в свою очередь, формирует «входы» контракта условного депонирования.

This blog\npost will answer that question in detail and clarify the team’s position and\nstrategy as we progress onward.\n\nTable of Contents\n * Putting Marketing in Context\n * Upcoming Marketing Initiatives\n * BasicSwap; A Door Major Opener\n * Community Empowerment\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPutting Marketing in Context\nFirst thing first, it’s essential to define what we mean by “marketing” to avoid\nany confusion. Marketing is an umbrella term that touches on brand awareness,\nPR, product placement, outreach, relationship building, and any other effort to\ngain adoption and new users or fans. It’s a wide range of actions converging\ntowards making Particl more known, liked, and used.\n\nWhy do Marketing?\nIn the case of Particl, marketing has two clear objectives.\n\n * Gain new users for Particl products (i.e., Particl Marketplace or BasicSwap)\n * Increase the number of coin holders and project advocates.\n\nFor marketing to have any real impact on the course of the project, results need\nto be long-lasting. Any new user, coin holder, or advocate gained from any\nmarketing campaign has to stick around for some time and be active within the\necosystem. When it comes to brand awareness campaigns, their message has to\nstick around and be clear.\n\nThis strategical and best value approach to marketing ensures that the project\nonly spends resources towards effective initiatives rather than adopting a\n“spray and pray” strategy that can work for more prosperous projects, but at an\nextreme cost.\n\nHow to Achieve our Marketing Objectives?\nTo achieve the two objectives mentioned above, we use two fundamental approaches\nto marketing.\n\nProduct-focused marketing: Product-focused marketing puts the spotlight on what\nproducts the project offers and what benefits they give to targeted audiences.\nThis aims at making people interested in the end products and is directly linked\nto adoption efforts.\n\nBrand awareness and notoriety building: The other approach is to increase\nParticl’s brand awareness and notoriety. In other words, it’s about being part\nof “the discussion” and being a project that people know about even if they’ve\nnever really used it. The more brand awareness and notoriety a project has, the\nmore free coverage it gets and the faster its community grows. \n\nThese two approaches will be leveraged by different types of marketing campaigns\n(mentioned a bit further down this post).\n\nHow is Marketing Funded at Particl?\nParticl is not an overly-funded project born out of an ICO or any other kind of\ncrowdfunding mechanism. Instead, it’s a humble community project that operates\nout of voluntary community donations through a decentralized and democratic\ntreasury system.\n\nThis means the project does not possess millions of dollars to pump into very\nlarge-scale marketing campaigns. It also means it cannot afford many of the\n“pay-to-play” marketing avenues that blockchain projects with deeper pockets\nusually leverage.\n\nAdditionally, because the team gets its funding paid in PART, and due to current\nlow liquidity on trading exchanges for PART pairs, the team has to be very\ncareful about how it spends marketing funds as to not cause any significant\ndownward pressure, essentially nullifying any marketing gains.\n\nMarketing Expectations\nDue to the current liquidity situation and the general costs of marketing within\nthe blockchain industry, it’s important to keep expectations realistic and plan\naround that reality. That’s what the team has done with this marketing strategy.\n\nThat’s also why marketing is currently being deployed gradually and\nstrategically, one initiative at a time. As we move forward in time, many\ninitiatives will start stacking up and run in parallel, giving a better sense of\nbeing widespread.\n\nAdditionally, expectations need to match the status of each Particl product.\nIndeed, Particl V3, for example, is still a beta piece of software that can\nstill be complicated to use for most people other than a few more technically\napt niches. Mind you, that is alright and is part of the journey as Particl\nevolves to an ecosystem that’s much more user-friendly. Still, it also means\nthat marketing the project towards audiences that are not ready to use the\nproduct might not be the most cost-effective strategy. Hence, selecting the\nright audiences to target is key.\n\nUpcoming Marketing Initiatives\nNow that we’ve mentioned all of the above considerations, it’s time to take a\ndeeper dive into the various marketing initiatives that are planned or are in\nprogress.\n\nWhat we've done recently\nRe-initiating direct mail marketing Shortly before the release of Particl V3 on\nmainnet, we’ve re-initiated our newsletter communications. This aims to\nre-engage people who’ve shown interest in Particl in the past and stay connected\nwith current fans. Direct mail marketing is a basic but powerful marketing tool\nand will be used sporadically (we won’t spam your inbox) for essential and\nbundled communications pieces. \n\nIf you still haven’t subscribed to our newsletter, don’t hesitate to do so; it’s\nthe best way to stay in touch! \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Particl Academy The Particl Academy is the\nuser-friendly guide to get started with Particl and become more familiar with\nit. It’s a critical piece of information required for newcomers to be able to\nstart using the platform without any hassle. \n\nThis can be the difference between someone interested but who gives up because\nit’s too difficult to get started and someone who sticks around. To browse the\nParticl Academy, simply head over to https://academy.particl.io/ \n\nProduct marketing New roadmap The new development roadmap is not necessarily a\nmarketing item in the proper sense, but it’s nonetheless a vital part of the\nmarketing strategy. That’s because that is where new people usually look to see\nwhat’s coming up next for a project and what is its long-term viability. \n\nThe new roadmap was carefully crafted to make user adoption easier by improving\nthe platform’s accessibility, usability, and user-friendliness. In addition, it\ncommunicates Particl’s long-term vision for its products and ecosystem, and\nhelps get new passionate supporters to stick around for the long haul. \n\nProduct marketing What's currently in progress\nNew website Particl’s new website (Particl.io) is set to become the cornerstone\nof any upcoming marketing effort. That’s because that’s where new people land\nwhen they first hear about a project or when they get curious about it through a\nmarketing campaign they’ve been exposed to. That’s also why we’ve been waiting\nfor its release before activating a few initiatives; we want Particl to look its\nbest and tell its story the way it should. This will inevitably lead to better\nconversion rates! \n\nOn that note, we are excited to announce that the new website will go live this\ncoming Tuesday, the 26th of October, 2021. So make sure to be around next week\nfor its launch, we’re sure you’re going to be delighted by it and will want to\nshow it to everybody! \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Digital ads (Twitter, Reddit) Digital ads are\nhelpful for two different reasons. For one, they can address both marketing\nobjectives by being either product or brand-focused. \n\nSecondly, they provide valuable data on the success of campaigns which allows us\nto test different messages and stories as well as different audiences. We can\nthen use these data points to tune all other marketing campaigns and focus on\nwhat really works. The intel we can get out of digital ad campaigns is why we\nare already in the process of planning them and want to deploy them before a few\nother initiatives. \n\nPreparations for digital ads have already begun, and this initiative will\ngradually ramp up within the next three months. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing More stories on Particl News At this time,\nParticl’s blog almost only contains news and updates. While that’s interesting\nfor those already a fan of the project, it doesn’t help convert new people into\nadvocates or users. Having more story-driven content will help better explain\nParticl’s story and mission, define its brand, and put the spotlight on the\nbigger picture (why we do what we do and why you need it). Additionally,\nSEO-friendly story contents help drive more traffic to the website. \n\nThis initiative is currently in progress as we’ve started working with a few\nwriters. Stories should soon start appearing on Particl News within their own\ndedicated “Stories” section. Make sure to have a read when you see a new story\ncome out and share it with the people you think will be interested in it! \n\nBrand awareness Reboot of the Part-Time Show You might remember the Part-Time\nShow, the podcast by Particl ambassador Dr. Kapil. As part of the Particl\nreboot, we also thought of rebooting the Part-Time Show with it, only this time,\ndifferently. Leveraging the new interactive Clubhouse application, the new show\nwill feature Dr. Kapil along with Joe Fisher, e-commerce expert. \n\nIt will talk about a wide variety of topics related to Particl, including\ne-commerce, privacy, data security, decentralization, the impact of distributed\nnetworks on democracy, economics, censorship, and much more. While not a\nParticl-centric show itself, the new formula of the show is going to be much\nmore dynamic. It intends on building relationships and initiating thoughtful\ndiscussions with people who understand the critical and modern issues of today’s\nsociety. \n\nClubhouse can be defined as a mix between a podcast social media and LinkedIn.\nWe hope that you join along the weekly episodes and participate in the\ndiscussion with us. You might just meet some fascinating folks! More information\nis to come about this in the next few days as we near the first episode. \n\nBrand awareness New team member To help with the many marketing tasks we have on\nour deck, a new team member will join the communications and marketing team in\nNovember. This new team member, which will mostly fill the role of a\ncommunications assistant, will be critical in allowing the team to deploy\nmultiple initiatives in parallel and amplify our efforts. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Community budget Also to help with marketing\nand encourage community initiatives, the team will be setting up and deploying a\ncommunity marketing budget very soon. At the time of this writing, a group has\nbeen formed on Element with a few community members eager to help spread the\nword and deploy initiatives of their own. A community budget intends on\nsupporting these go-getters with resources from the team. \n\nLookup the Community Empowerment section of this blog post further down below\nfor more information on how to get involved. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Occasional Reddit AMAs With the Particl reboot\ngoing on strong, there are a lot of things changing around the project and a ton\nto look out for. But with so much information, it’s possible that you may have\nsome questions. So from time to time, the Particl team will run AMAs on its\nsub-Reddit and pin it so that anyone can ask their questions and have the answer\ndisplayed prominently for all others to see. This should help with transparency\nand circulating important information to the community. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing What comes after\nWider distribution of press releases Distributing press releases in quality\npublications will lead to more organic coverage as editors and writers scout PR\npublications daily for exciting content. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing More podcast appearances and interviews With\nimproving Particl's brand awareness in mind, appearing in more podcasts and\ninterviews will help spread the Particl word further and expose the project to\nmany more people. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Publish more documentation For Particl to gain\nadoption, using the platform and understanding how to use it must be as easy as\npossible. Publishing more educational, informational, and technical\ndocumentation will help with that. \n\nProduct marketing Increase social media activity and exposure Crypto Twitter is\nwhere it's at, and Particl needs to have better exposure within that community\nif it wants to go viral. So improving Particl's social media exposure and taking\npart in the discussion is important and planned for the near future. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing Integrate other coins into Particl Desktop \nBecause so much has changed with Particl V3, support for other coins is\ntemporarily disabled. We plan on adding that feature back right after releasing\nthe SMSG Manager (roadmap item). Integrating more coins and making it easier for\ntheir users to acquire PART increases the potential for adoption within these\ncommunities. \n\nBrand awareness Product marketing New exchange listings Getting listed on new\nexchanges is a no-brainer to improve liquidity, exposure and make the platform\nmore accessible. The team is currently in negotiation with two exchanges and\nshould have more news on the subject soon. More exchange listings are planned as\nlong as the listing costs are reasonable, and the exchange can provide real\nvalue back to the project. \n\nBrand awareness Seed the marketplace with more listings A few months ago, a CCS proposal\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html] that\nsuggested seeding the marketplace with many listings was published (and funded).\nAdding thousands of listings will give the marketplace the boost it needs to get\nthe ball rolling and become a vibrant e-commerce platform. This initiative is\ncurrently under active development. \n\nProduct marketing It obviously doesn't stop here, but the team will work on the\nitems mentioned above in the short to mid-term. If you have any marketing ideas\nor suggestions, feel free to reach out to the team to discuss them.\n\nBasicSwap; A Major Door Opener\nWhen it comes to product-based marketing, we usually think about Particl\nMarketplace because it’s the project’s flagship application; a one-of-a-kind\ndecentralized and private marketplace like none other. But shortly, a new\nParticl-made product with excellent marketing potential will go live in open\nbeta: BasicSwap.\n\nAs you might know by now, BasicSwap is a cross-chain and private decentralized\nexchange that uses atomic swap and the SMSG network. It lets two users who don’t\nknow each other safely exchange cryptocurrencies from two different blockchains.\nBasicSwap is set to become a crucial aspect of the Particl ecosystem and, at the\nsame time, the project’s marketing strategy.\n\nIncidentally, speculation is the most popular and widespread use case for\ncryptocurrencies. And as it becomes increasingly difficult and burdening to\nregister and trade on centralized exchanges, many people are starting to look\nfor decentralized solutions to suit their needs. As a result, the market share\nof decentralized marketplaces and the number of users grows every day. That’s an\nexcellent opportunity for BasicSwap and the Particl project!\n\nBasicSwap’s unique propositions, namely that it is cross-chain compatible,\nprivate, has order books, and supports Monero, are sure to turn some heads.\nBasicSwap is indeed set to generate adoption for the Particl ecosystem just on\nits own, independent of any marketplace activity. But, then, as it becomes an\nintegrated part of Particl Desktop, its users are likely to bleed into other\napplications (i.e., Particl Marketplace), making them users of the Particl\necosystem as a whole rather than just one specific app. That’s the beauty of an\nall-inclusive decentralized ecosystem of apps and Particl's vision slowly coming\nto fruitition!\n\nIn other words, the addition of BasicSwap is much more than just a new useful\napp; it’s a massive load of marketing ammo both for itself and the broader\nParticl ecosystem. So expect marketing to be adapted as such and keep it in mind\nwhen you talk about Particl to other people.\n\nCommunity Empowerment\nThe best marketing tool for any crypto project is the power of its community.\nThat’s why we want to encourage community initiatives as much as possible with a\nnew dedicated budget!\n\nDo you have any marketing, outreach, or PR initiative that you’d like to lead?\nThen simply reach out to the team on Element, Discord, or Telegram with a\nwritten proposal explaining your project. If it gets approved, you’ll be asked\nto publish it on the CCS [https://ccs.particl.io]. Once your proposal is live,\nthe team will then fund it using its dedicated community budget.\n\nPublishing community-led marketing initiatives on CCS ensures the maximum level\nof transparency, lets others see what kind of efforts are ongoing, and helps\ndetermine what can people do to help. We highly encourage you all to\nparticipate; the more of us that spread the good word, the further it reaches!\n\n> Note 1: Keep in mind that we constantly receive many ideas with varying levels\nof detail. Before reaching out, make sure to think of all the details and write\nthem down in your proposal. You also need to be able to lead that initiative\nyourself or delegate tasks on your own. The team can provide you with funding in\nPART and help you get started, but community-led initiatives are ultimately\nheaded by whoever makes a proposal.\n> Note 2: If you have suggestions or marketing ideas you may not have the time to\nlead, don’t hesitate to contact the team regardless. We’ll determine whether the\nidea is viable and if it is possible to integrate it within our workflow.\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nIf you haven’t already done so, we invite you to subscribe to our newsletter so\nthat you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive content.

Shortly after <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/team-funding-request-1.html\">raising funds from the decentralized treasury fund</a>, the Particl team has set up a few initiatives in motion and been cranking up development!</p><p>In terms of significant milestones since, we find the long-anticipated <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-v3-now-available-on-mainnet/\">Particl V3 mainnet release</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v22.0.1.0rc1\">Particl Core catching up to the latest Bitcoin version (0.22)</a>, the upcoming BasicSwap DEX nearing its open beta phase, and the reveal of a work-in-progress wallet: Electrum (with support for a Lightning Network user interface).</p><p>While all of these achievements are exciting from a technical standpoint, many in the community have been wondering: <em>“But what about marketing?”</em>. This blog post will answer that question in detail and clarify the team’s position and strategy as we progress onward.</p><h1 id=\"table-of-contents\">Table of Contents</h1><ul><li><strong><a href=\"#putting-marketing-in-context\">Putting Marketing in Context</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#upcoming-marketing-initiatives\">Upcoming Marketing Initiatives</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#basicswap-a-major-door-opener\">BasicSwap; A Door Major Opener</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#community-empowerment\">Community Empowerment</a></strong></li></ul><hr><h2 id=\"putting-marketing-in-context\">Putting Marketing in Context</h2><p>First thing first, it’s essential to define what we mean by “marketing” to avoid any confusion. Marketing is an umbrella term that touches on brand awareness, PR, product placement, outreach, relationship building, and any other effort to gain adoption and new users or fans. It’s a wide range of actions converging towards making Particl more known, liked, and used.</p><h3 id=\"why-do-marketing\">Why do Marketing?</h3><p>In the case of Particl, marketing has two clear objectives.</p><ul><li>Gain new users for Particl products (i.e., Particl Marketplace or BasicSwap)</li><li>Increase the number of coin holders and project advocates.</li></ul><p>For marketing to have any real impact on the course of the project, results need to be long-lasting. Any new user, coin holder, or advocate gained from any marketing campaign has to stick around for some time and be active within the ecosystem. When it comes to brand awareness campaigns, their message has to stick around and be clear.</p><p>This strategical and best value approach to marketing ensures that the project only spends resources towards effective initiatives rather than adopting a “spray and pray” strategy that can work for more prosperous projects, but at an extreme cost.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-achieve-our-marketing-objectives\">How to Achieve our Marketing Objectives?</h3><p>To achieve the two objectives mentioned above, we use two fundamental approaches to marketing.</p><p><strong>Product-focused marketing: </strong>Product-focused marketing puts the spotlight on what products the project offers and what benefits they give to targeted audiences. This aims at making people interested in the end products and is directly linked to adoption efforts.</p><p><strong>Brand awareness and notoriety building: </strong>The other approach is to increase Particl’s brand awareness and notoriety. In other words, it’s about being part of “the discussion” and being a project that people know about even if they’ve never really used it. The more brand awareness and notoriety a project has, the more free coverage it gets and the faster its community grows. </p><p>These two approaches will be leveraged by different types of marketing campaigns (mentioned a bit further down this post).</p><h3 id=\"how-is-marketing-funded-at-particl\">How is Marketing Funded at Particl?</h3><p>Particl is not an overly-funded project born out of an ICO or any other kind of crowdfunding mechanism. Instead, it’s a humble community project that operates out of voluntary community donations through a decentralized and democratic treasury system.</p><p>This means the project does not possess millions of dollars to pump into very large-scale marketing campaigns. It also means it cannot afford many of the “pay-to-play” marketing avenues that blockchain projects with deeper pockets usually leverage.</p><p>Additionally, because the team gets its funding paid in PART, and due to current low liquidity on trading exchanges for PART pairs, the team has to be very careful about how it spends marketing funds as to not cause any significant downward pressure, essentially nullifying any marketing gains.</p><h3 id=\"marketing-expectations\">Marketing Expectations</h3><p>Due to the current liquidity situation and the general costs of marketing within the blockchain industry, it’s important to keep expectations realistic and plan around that reality. That’s what the team has done with this marketing strategy.</p><p>That’s also why marketing is currently being deployed gradually and strategically, one initiative at a time. As we move forward in time, many initiatives will start stacking up and run in parallel, giving a better sense of being widespread.</p><p>Additionally, expectations need to match the status of each Particl product. Indeed, Particl V3, for example, is still a beta piece of software that can still be complicated to use for most people other than a few more technically apt niches. Mind you, that is alright and is part of the journey as Particl evolves to an ecosystem that’s much more user-friendly. Still, it also means that marketing the project towards audiences that are not ready to use the product might not be the most cost-effective strategy. Hence, selecting the right audiences to target is key.</p><h2 id=\"upcoming-marketing-initiatives\">Upcoming Marketing Initiatives</h2><p>Now that we’ve mentioned all of the above considerations, it’s time to take a deeper dive into the various marketing initiatives that are planned or are in progress.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <h2>What we've done recently</h2>\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">Re-initiating direct mail marketing</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Shortly before the release of Particl V3 on mainnet, we’ve re-initiated our newsletter communications.

That’s because that’s where new people land when they first hear about a project or when they get curious about it through a marketing campaign they’ve been exposed to. That’s also why we’ve been waiting for its release before activating a few initiatives; we want Particl to look its best and tell its story the way it should.

We can then use these data points to tune all other marketing campaigns and focus on what really works. The intel we can get out of digital ad campaigns is why we are already in the process of planning them and want to deploy them before a few other initiatives.\n                        <br>\n                        </br>\n                        <b>Preparations for digital ads have already begun, and this initiative will gradually ramp up within the next three months.</b> \n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Brand awareness</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Product marketing</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck3\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck3\">More stories on Particl News</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            At this time, Particl’s blog almost only contains news and updates. While that’s interesting for those already a fan of the project, it doesn’t help convert new people into advocates or users. Having more story-driven content will help better explain Particl’s story and mission, define its brand, and put the spotlight on the bigger picture (why we do what we do and why you need it).

As part of the Particl reboot, we also thought of rebooting the Part-Time Show with it, only this time, differently. Leveraging the new interactive Clubhouse application, the new show will feature Dr. Kapil along with Joe Fisher, e-commerce expert.\n                        <br>\n                        </br>\n                            It will talk about a wide variety of topics related to Particl, including e-commerce, privacy, data security, decentralization, the impact of distributed networks on democracy, economics, censorship, and much more. While not a Particl-centric show itself, the new formula of the show is going to be much more dynamic.

If you have any marketing ideas or suggestions, feel free to reach out to the team to discuss them.</p><h2 id=\"basicswap-a-major-door-opener\">BasicSwap; A Major Door Opener</h2><p>When it comes to product-based marketing, we usually think about Particl Marketplace because it’s the project’s flagship application; a one-of-a-kind decentralized and private marketplace like none other. But shortly, a new Particl-made product with excellent marketing potential will go live in open beta: BasicSwap.</p><p>As you might know by now, BasicSwap is a cross-chain and private decentralized exchange that uses atomic swap and the SMSG network. It lets two users who don’t know each other safely exchange cryptocurrencies from two different blockchains. BasicSwap is set to become a crucial aspect of the Particl ecosystem and, at the same time, the project’s marketing strategy.</p><p>Incidentally, speculation is the most popular and widespread use case for cryptocurrencies. And as it becomes increasingly difficult and burdening to register and trade on centralized exchanges, many people are starting to look for decentralized solutions to suit their needs. As a result, the market share of decentralized marketplaces and the number of users grows every day. That’s an excellent opportunity for BasicSwap and the Particl project!</p><p>BasicSwap’s unique propositions, namely that it is cross-chain compatible, private, has order books, and supports Monero, are sure to turn some heads. BasicSwap is indeed set to generate adoption for the Particl ecosystem just on its own, independent of any marketplace activity. But, then, as it becomes an integrated part of Particl Desktop, its users are likely to bleed into other applications (i.e., Particl Marketplace), making them users of the Particl ecosystem as a whole rather than just one specific app. That’s the beauty of an all-inclusive decentralized ecosystem of apps and Particl's vision slowly coming to fruitition!</p><p>In other words, the addition of BasicSwap is much more than just a new useful app; it’s a massive load of marketing ammo both for itself and the broader Particl ecosystem. So expect marketing to be adapted as such and keep it in mind when you talk about Particl to other people.</p><h2 id=\"community-empowerment\">Community Empowerment</h2><p>The best marketing tool for any crypto project is the power of its community. That’s why we want to encourage community initiatives as much as possible with a new dedicated budget!</p><p>Do you have any marketing, outreach, or PR initiative that you’d like to lead? Then simply reach out to the team on Element, Discord, or Telegram with a written proposal explaining your project. If it gets approved, you’ll be asked to publish it on the <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io\">CCS</a>. Once your proposal is live, the team will then fund it using its dedicated community budget.</p><p>Publishing community-led marketing initiatives on CCS ensures the maximum level of transparency, lets others see what kind of efforts are ongoing, and helps determine what can people do to help. We highly encourage you all to participate; the more of us that spread the good word, the further it reaches!</p><blockquote><strong>Note 1: </strong><em>Keep in mind that we constantly receive many ideas with varying levels of detail. Before reaching out, make sure to think of all the details and write them down in your proposal. You also need to be able to lead that initiative yourself or delegate tasks on your own. The team can provide you with funding in PART and help you get started, but community-led initiatives are ultimately headed by whoever makes a proposal.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Note 2: </strong><em>If you have suggestions or marketing ideas you may not have the time to lead, don’t hesitate to contact the team regardless. We’ll determine whether the idea is viable and if it is possible to integrate it within our workflow.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"subscribe-to-our-newsletter\">Subscribe to our Newsletter</h2><p>If you haven’t already done so, we invite you to subscribe to our newsletter so that you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive content.

This blog post will answer that question in detail and clarify the team’s position and strategy as we progress onward.</p><h1 id=\"table-of-contents\">Table of Contents</h1><ul><li><strong><a href=\"#putting-marketing-in-context\">Putting Marketing in Context</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#upcoming-marketing-initiatives\">Upcoming Marketing Initiatives</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#basicswap-a-major-door-opener\">BasicSwap; A Door Major Opener</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#community-empowerment\">Community Empowerment</a></strong></li></ul><hr><h2 id=\"putting-marketing-in-context\">Putting Marketing in Context</h2><p>First thing first, it’s essential to define what we mean by “marketing” to avoid any confusion. Marketing is an umbrella term that touches on brand awareness, PR, product placement, outreach, relationship building, and any other effort to gain adoption and new users or fans. It’s a wide range of actions converging towards making Particl more known, liked, and used.</p><h3 id=\"why-do-marketing\">Why do Marketing?</h3><p>In the case of Particl, marketing has two clear objectives.</p><ul><li>Gain new users for Particl products (i.e., Particl Marketplace or BasicSwap)</li><li>Increase the number of coin holders and project advocates.</li></ul><p>For marketing to have any real impact on the course of the project, results need to be long-lasting. Any new user, coin holder, or advocate gained from any marketing campaign has to stick around for some time and be active within the ecosystem. When it comes to brand awareness campaigns, their message has to stick around and be clear.</p><p>This strategical and best value approach to marketing ensures that the project only spends resources towards effective initiatives rather than adopting a “spray and pray” strategy that can work for more prosperous projects, but at an extreme cost.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-achieve-our-marketing-objectives\">How to Achieve our Marketing Objectives?</h3><p>To achieve the two objectives mentioned above, we use two fundamental approaches to marketing.</p><p><strong>Product-focused marketing: </strong>Product-focused marketing puts the spotlight on what products the project offers and what benefits they give to targeted audiences. This aims at making people interested in the end products and is directly linked to adoption efforts.</p><p><strong>Brand awareness and notoriety building: </strong>The other approach is to increase Particl’s brand awareness and notoriety. In other words, it’s about being part of “the discussion” and being a project that people know about even if they’ve never really used it. The more brand awareness and notoriety a project has, the more free coverage it gets and the faster its community grows. </p><p>These two approaches will be leveraged by different types of marketing campaigns (mentioned a bit further down this post).</p><h3 id=\"how-is-marketing-funded-at-particl\">How is Marketing Funded at Particl?</h3><p>Particl is not an overly-funded project born out of an ICO or any other kind of crowdfunding mechanism. Instead, it’s a humble community project that operates out of voluntary community donations through a decentralized and democratic treasury system.</p><p>This means the project does not possess millions of dollars to pump into very large-scale marketing campaigns. It also means it cannot afford many of the “pay-to-play” marketing avenues that blockchain projects with deeper pockets usually leverage.</p><p>Additionally, because the team gets its funding paid in PART, and due to current low liquidity on trading exchanges for PART pairs, the team has to be very careful about how it spends marketing funds as to not cause any significant downward pressure, essentially nullifying any marketing gains.</p><h3 id=\"marketing-expectations\">Marketing Expectations</h3><p>Due to the current liquidity situation and the general costs of marketing within the blockchain industry, it’s important to keep expectations realistic and plan around that reality. That’s what the team has done with this marketing strategy.</p><p>That’s also why marketing is currently being deployed gradually and strategically, one initiative at a time. As we move forward in time, many initiatives will start stacking up and run in parallel, giving a better sense of being widespread.</p><p>Additionally, expectations need to match the status of each Particl product. Indeed, Particl V3, for example, is still a beta piece of software that can still be complicated to use for most people other than a few more technically apt niches. Mind you, that is alright and is part of the journey as Particl evolves to an ecosystem that’s much more user-friendly. Still, it also means that marketing the project towards audiences that are not ready to use the product might not be the most cost-effective strategy. Hence, selecting the right audiences to target is key.</p><h2 id=\"upcoming-marketing-initiatives\">Upcoming Marketing Initiatives</h2><p>Now that we’ve mentioned all of the above considerations, it’s time to take a deeper dive into the various marketing initiatives that are planned or are in progress.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <h2>What we've done recently</h2>\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">Re-initiating direct mail marketing</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Shortly before the release of Particl V3 on mainnet, we’ve re-initiated our newsletter communications.

In addition, it communicates Particl’s long-term vision for its products and ecosystem, and helps get new passionate supporters to stick around for the long haul.\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Product marketing</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n            </div><!-- tabs close-->\n        </div><!-- col close-->\n            </div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <h2>What's currently in progress</h2>\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck1\">New website</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Particl’s new website (Particl.io) is set to become the cornerstone of any upcoming marketing effort. That’s because that’s where new people land when they first hear about a project or when they get curious about it through a marketing campaign they’ve been exposed to. That’s also why we’ve been waiting for its release before activating a few initiatives; we want Particl to look its best and tell its story the way it should. This will inevitably lead to better conversion rates!\n                        <br>\n\n                        <br>\n                            On that note, we are excited to announce that <b>the new website will go live this coming Tuesday, the 26th of October, 2021</b>. So make sure to be around next week for its launch, we’re sure you’re going to be delighted by it and will want to show it to everybody!\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Brand awareness</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Product marketing</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck2\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck2\">Digital ads (Twitter, Reddit)</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Digital ads are helpful for two different reasons. For one, they can address both marketing objectives by being either product or brand-focused. \n                        <br>\n                        <br>\n                            Secondly, they provide valuable data on the success of campaigns which allows us to test different messages and stories as well as different audiences. We can then use these data points to tune all other marketing campaigns and focus on what really works. The intel we can get out of digital ad campaigns is why we are already in the process of planning them and want to deploy them before a few other initiatives.\n                        <br>\n                        <br>\n                        <b>Preparations for digital ads have already begun, and this initiative will gradually ramp up within the next three months.</b> \n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Brand awareness</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag active\">Product marketing</span>\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck3\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck3\">More stories on Particl News</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            At this time, Particl’s blog almost only contains news and updates. While that’s interesting for those already a fan of the project, it doesn’t help convert new people into advocates or users. Having more story-driven content will help better explain Particl’s story and mission, define its brand, and put the spotlight on the bigger picture (why we do what we do and why you need it). Additionally, SEO-friendly story contents help drive more traffic to the website.\n                        <br>\n                        <br>\n                            This initiative is currently in progress as we’ve started working with a few writers.

As part of the Particl reboot, we also thought of rebooting the Part-Time Show with it, only this time, differently. Leveraging the new interactive Clubhouse application, the new show will feature Dr. Kapil along with Joe Fisher, e-commerce expert.\n                        <br>\n                        <br>\n                            It will talk about a wide variety of topics related to Particl, including e-commerce, privacy, data security, decentralization, the impact of distributed networks on democracy, economics, censorship, and much more. While not a Particl-centric show itself, the new formula of the show is going to be much more dynamic. It intends on building relationships and initiating thoughtful discussions with people who understand the critical and modern issues of today’s society.\n                        <br>\n                        <br>\n                            Clubhouse can be defined as a mix between a podcast social media and LinkedIn.

If you have any marketing ideas or suggestions, feel free to reach out to the team to discuss them.</p><h2 id=\"basicswap-a-major-door-opener\">BasicSwap; A Major Door Opener</h2><p>When it comes to product-based marketing, we usually think about Particl Marketplace because it’s the project’s flagship application; a one-of-a-kind decentralized and private marketplace like none other. But shortly, a new Particl-made product with excellent marketing potential will go live in open beta: BasicSwap.</p><p>As you might know by now, BasicSwap is a cross-chain and private decentralized exchange that uses atomic swap and the SMSG network. It lets two users who don’t know each other safely exchange cryptocurrencies from two different blockchains. BasicSwap is set to become a crucial aspect of the Particl ecosystem and, at the same time, the project’s marketing strategy.</p><p>Incidentally, speculation is the most popular and widespread use case for cryptocurrencies. And as it becomes increasingly difficult and burdening to register and trade on centralized exchanges, many people are starting to look for decentralized solutions to suit their needs. As a result, the market share of decentralized marketplaces and the number of users grows every day. That’s an excellent opportunity for BasicSwap and the Particl project!</p><p>BasicSwap’s unique propositions, namely that it is cross-chain compatible, private, has order books, and supports Monero, are sure to turn some heads. BasicSwap is indeed set to generate adoption for the Particl ecosystem just on its own, independent of any marketplace activity. But, then, as it becomes an integrated part of Particl Desktop, its users are likely to bleed into other applications (i.e., Particl Marketplace), making them users of the Particl ecosystem as a whole rather than just one specific app. That’s the beauty of an all-inclusive decentralized ecosystem of apps and Particl's vision slowly coming to fruitition!</p><p>In other words, the addition of BasicSwap is much more than just a new useful app; it’s a massive load of marketing ammo both for itself and the broader Particl ecosystem. So expect marketing to be adapted as such and keep it in mind when you talk about Particl to other people.</p><h2 id=\"community-empowerment\">Community Empowerment</h2><p>The best marketing tool for any crypto project is the power of its community. That’s why we want to encourage community initiatives as much as possible with a new dedicated budget!</p><p>Do you have any marketing, outreach, or PR initiative that you’d like to lead? Then simply reach out to the team on Element, Discord, or Telegram with a written proposal explaining your project. If it gets approved, you’ll be asked to publish it on the <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io\">CCS</a>. Once your proposal is live, the team will then fund it using its dedicated community budget.</p><p>Publishing community-led marketing initiatives on CCS ensures the maximum level of transparency, lets others see what kind of efforts are ongoing, and helps determine what can people do to help. We highly encourage you all to participate; the more of us that spread the good word, the further it reaches!</p><blockquote><strong>Note 1: </strong><em>Keep in mind that we constantly receive many ideas with varying levels of detail. Before reaching out, make sure to think of all the details and write them down in your proposal. You also need to be able to lead that initiative yourself or delegate tasks on your own. The team can provide you with funding in PART and help you get started, but community-led initiatives are ultimately headed by whoever makes a proposal.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Note 2: </strong><em>If you have suggestions or marketing ideas you may not have the time to lead, don’t hesitate to contact the team regardless. We’ll determine whether the idea is viable and if it is possible to integrate it within our workflow.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"subscribe-to-our-newsletter\">Subscribe to our Newsletter</h2><p>If you haven’t already done so, we invite you to subscribe to our newsletter so that you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive content.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success.
