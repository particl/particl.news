In\nfact, they often fare worse than traditional fiat currencies in preserving\nfinancial confidentiality. Indeed, fiat systems typically handle fund transfers\nthrough secured channels designed to safeguard users' financial data from\nunauthorized public exposure.\n\nIn stark contrast, all Bitcoin transactions are permanently recorded on a public\nledger, openly exposing the entirety of one's financial details to any curious\nobserver. While Bitcoin's pseudonymous nature may foster a sense of anonymity in\nlimited contexts, this perception is increasingly recognized as a dangerous\nillusion.\n\nIn fact, transaction tracing capabilities have advanced significantly in the\npast few years, driven in part by regulatory requirements like\nKnow-Your-Customer (KYC) compliance that have necessitated increased transaction\nmonitoring by financial services.\n\nHistorically, only regulatory bodies and financial institutions had access to\ndetailed reports of users' on-chain financial histories through partnerships\nwith blockchain analytics firms however, the ability to effectively deanonymize\ntransactions and map them to real-world identities is rapidly proliferating to\nnew actors — most concerningly, criminals, hackers, and other malicious entities\nintent on exploiting this data for financial gain at the expense of unsuspecting\nvictims — thanks to the rapid evolution of large language models and artificial\nintelligence that have spawned widely accessible tracing protocols.\n\nThese escalating privacy vulnerabilities underscore the paramount importance of\ndeveloping robust privacy-preserving solutions for cryptocurrencies across the\nglobe, such as, among others, ”privacy coins”. Maintaining financial\nconfidentiality is not merely a luxury but an essential capability to safeguard\nusers operating in these systems.\n\nBitcoin and eCommerce\nHowever, when it comes to decentralized commerce – the logical evolution beyond\ndecentralized currencies – merely utilizing privacy coins is not sufficient.\nWhile on-chain transactions may be inherently private, the platforms\nfacilitating purchases and sales represent another significant attack vector\nthat must be addressed.\n\nAs regulatory obligations evolve, businesses operating centralized\ncryptocurrency platforms may be compelled to collect extensive user information,\nincluding transaction histories, associated identities, IP addresses, shipping\ndetails from buyers, sales data from sellers, and more. While one could\nreasonably expect regulatory bodies to handle such information responsibly, the\nsame assurances cannot be extended to the platforms themselves, as highlighted\nin our previous articles on the imperatives of privacy here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/] \nand here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-the-need-to-own-your-data-19bc31b0ec74/]\n.\n\nBut even if all platforms always acted in good faith, this centralized\naggregation of sensitive data becomes an enticing target for hackers and other\nmalicious actors seeking to exploit personal and financial information for\nillicit gains.\n\nThe Inherent Safety Risks of DeCommerce\nThe logical solution, therefore, is to develop an eCommerce platform that is as\ndecentralized as cryptocurrencies themselves. Such a platform would operate in a\npurely peer-to-peer manner, built upon a truly decentralized architecture devoid\nof single points of failure or centralized components. The objective is to offer\nservices akin to centralized eCommerce giants like eBay or Amazon, but without\nany central entity, thus eliminating the associated costs, fees, and frictions\ninherent to intermediaries. A \"decentralized online marketplace\", embodying\nBitcoin's ethos, and providing a clear user experience improvement over\ncentralized counterparts without data collection.\n\nHowever, while recent advancements in blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies\nenable such decentralized eCommerce platforms, they also introduce new\nchallenges in preserving users' financial data privacy and safety.\n\nPicture this scenario: You open a decentralized marketplace, hoping to purchase\na new computer online. You browse available listings from sellers worldwide and\nfind a suitable item. You proceed to add it to your cart and checkout, providing\nthe seller with your shipping address. Herein lies a significant safety concern;\nif you've paid using pseudonymous cryptocurrencies, you've likely revealed your\nphysical location alongside your entire financial history, including balances\nand past transactions.\n\nIn most cases, such disclosures may be innocuous, however, over an extended\nperiod, you or someone else may inadvertently expose critical details to\nmalicious actors, which could be used to identify and target the potential\nvictim. This risk vector is particularly concerning for high net-worth\nindividuals, as every purchase they make could effectively paint a target on\ntheir backs, making this situation simply unsustainable.\n\nCentralized platforms like eBay or Amazon typically circumvent this issue, as\npayments are facilitated through highly regulated centralized providers like\nPayPal, among others. While these entities face valid criticisms, they at least\navoid exposing users' complete financial histories on pseudonymous ledgers.\n\nHowever, a decentralized platform, by its very nature, does not rely on payment\nprocessors. Instead, it enables direct peer-to-peer trade between buyers and\nsellers. Consequently, an alternative solution must be implemented to preserve\nusers' financial privacy and security.\n\nThe Need for Privacy in DeCommerce\nParticl Marketplace addresses these concerns with its decentralized and secure\nonline marketplace, often touted as a privacy-first eCommerce solution. It\nensures user safety by providing robust privacy safeguards in two critical\nareas.\n\nTransactional Privacy\nFirst, it facilitates complete transactional privacy for counterparties through\nthe use of PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, which integrates advanced\non-chain privacy protocols. Two specific protocols are instrumental in\npreserving financial confidentiality: Confidential Transactions (\"CT\") and ring\nsignatures (\"RingCT\").\n\nCT transactions conceal the transfer amounts between parties, while RingCT\nobfuscates both transaction amounts and participant identities. However, RingCT\ntransactions lack programmable outputs, rendering them incompatible with\ndecentralized applications like Particl Marketplace. To address this limitation,\nRingCT inputs can be mapped to CT outputs, which possess programmable\ncapabilities. By chaining these protocols, Particl Marketplace effectively\nharnesses RingCT's enhanced privacy while facilitating seamless integration,\nproviding users with safety — which is otherwise entirely absent without\ntransactional privacy — and the assurance that their financial data remains\nconfidential during transactions.\n\nData-free Marketplace Activity\nSecondly, Particl Marketplace addresses the concerns surrounding excessive data\ncollection practices by centralized eCommerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, and\nEtsy, which have faced criticism for undermining user privacy. Some platforms\nhave even exploited user data to directly compete with their own sellers, as\nexemplified by AmazonBasics products and other Amazon sub-brands – an issue we\nhave previously explored in depth here\n[https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/].\n\nMoreover, while platforms claim to harvest data to enhance user experiences,\ntracking shopping habits can inadvertently expose sensitive information without\nconsent. A notable example is the Target pregnancy prediction case, in which an\nunsuspecting father learned of his daughter's pregnancy due to ad targeting – a\nscenario we’ve also previously discussed here\n[https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/].\n\nTo safeguard against such privacy infringements and data misuse, Particl\nMarketplace is designed to eliminate data generation, collection, storage, or\ndistribution entirely – encompassing both financial and non-financial metadata.\nAll marketplace activity data is stored locally, and all data transmitted (such\nas buyer-seller communications or shipping details) is conveyed through\nend-to-end encrypted messages via SMSG, a peer-to-peer data and messaging\nplatform (\"mixnet\") operating alongside Particl Core nodes\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/].\n\nThis privacy-first architecture ensures user safety and guarantees complete data\nownership and control, while preventing malicious data extraction through hacks,\nexploits, or the simple act of buying or selling online.\n\nConclusion\nWhile various accessibility, usability, and user-experience improvements are\nstill needed, the end result is a decentralized online marketplace that\neliminates fees and associated frictions inherent to third-party intermediaries\nwithin the eCommerce domain.\n\nHowever, beyond these benefits, it primarily serves as a secure platform for\ncryptocurrency users to engage in direct peer-to-peer trade without compromising\ntheir safety by exposing financial information to potentially malicious\nstrangers.\n\nAs we have aimed to clarify with this blog post, privacy in the context of\ncryptocurrency usage transcends a luxury or edge case. In scenarios such as\neCommerce/deCommerce, it is an absolute necessity to ensure the safety and\nwell-being of users transacting with unknown counterparties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

for seamless and\npractical decentralized commerce solutions remains a driving force. Although\nthis is a self-evident use case for crypto, comprehensive solutions to use\ndecentralized money as money, without relying on heavily centralized\narchitecture, is lacking.\n\nWhile achieving this goal has proven challenging, this article explores how\nintegrating BasicSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) that offers Litecoin\npairs, into Particl Marketplace, a decentralized e-commerce platform, offers a\nsolution to overcome many user experience obstacles that have come to hinder the\nevolution of cryptocurrencies as a medium of payment.\n\nBy providing multi-currency support\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-integration-unlocking-currency-agnostic-commerce-on-particl/] \nto the decentralized e-commerce ecosystem, this upcoming integration offers a\ntangible path forward for many coins, unlocking the potential for widespread\ncryptocurrency usage in everyday retail transactions.\n\nWith this in mind, Litecoin, with its focused push as a payment currency, serves\nas the perfect candidate to illustrate this transformative potential, allowing\nanyone to use Litecoin for shopping.\n\nLitecoin; Faster and Cheaper Transactions\nLitecoin has garnered significant attention for its faster transaction times and\nlower fees compared to Bitcoin – a stark contrast to the latter's reputation for\nsluggish and costly processing. This, from the beginning, has positioned\nLitecoin as an ideal cryptocurrency for payments and commerce. Recognizing its\nstrengths in speed and affordability, the Litecoin community has been actively\npromoting its adoption as a practical and viable payment solution for years now.\n\nLitecoin MWEB and Privacy: Solidifying Litecoin as True Digital Cash\nLitecoin's MWEB (MimbleWimble Extension Blocks) introduces a significant\nimprovement to an already payment-friendly digital currency: transactional\nprivacy. This brings confidential transactions and privacy features to the\nLitecoin network, a pivotal development poised to solidify its positioning as\ntrue digital cash and a viable currency for payments.\n\nPrivacy is, of course, a crucial aspect in the realm of digital payments, as it\nsafeguards users' and businesses' financial information and promotes fungibility\n– a fundamental characteristic of sound money.\n\nParticl Marketplace: Redefining Decentralized E-Commerce\nWhile transactional privacy is paramount, it is also crucial for the platform\nfacilitating such payments to uphold privacy as well.\n\nEnvision this scenario: you send a private payment using Litecoin MWEB or even\nMonero to purchase an item online. However, you later discover that this\nplatform has been collecting user data and subsequently fell victim to a data\nbreach, exposing your shipping information, shopping history, along with\naddresses and payment details to an attacker. An absolute nightmare, even if the\ninitial payment was conducted through a private transaction.\n\nThis underscores the fact that private payments alone are insufficient to\ncompletely safeguard your shopping habits and selling history. This fact stands\nas a premise for the design of Particl Marketplace.\n\nParticl Marketplace is a decentralized, privacy-focused e-commerce platform\nbuilt using blockchain and peer-to-peer technology. Unlike traditional\ne-commerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, Etsy, or Alibaba, Particl Marketplace\noperates without intermediaries, ensuring secure and private transactions\nbetween users, free from fees or restrictions. Buyers and sellers transact\ndirectly, benefiting from a two-party escrow system that protects both parties\nand keeps all trade information private to the involved parties only.\n\nUsing Litecoin for Shopping on Particl Marketplace Soon to be AvailableWhile the\nplatform's unapologetically decentralized nature and privacy features make it an\nattractive alternative to centralized e-commerce platforms (which often face\ncensorship, data breaches, and other vulnerabilities), it is currently limited\nto using PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, as the settlement currency. This\nis due to PART’s unique technology being an integral component in enabling some\nof the marketplace's unique features in the first place.\n\nBasicSwap DEX: Enabling Multi-Currency Payments\nLitecoin MWEB Balances and Conversions Live on BasicSwap DEXLitecoin\nMimbleWimble balances and balance conversions are now live on BasicSwap DEX, a\nfirst step towards full MWEB swaps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/litecoin-mweb-balances-and-conversions-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\nBasicSwap DEX is a decentralized exchange protocol and platform powered by\natomic swaps and SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a distributed data and\nmessaging protocol (often referred to as a “mixnet”). It offers a non-custodial\nand privacy-first trading experience, enabling trustless cross-chain swaps\nbetween different cryptocurrencies across various blockchains. And just like\nParticl Marketplace, it imposes no fees, restrictions, or data collection\npractices.\n\nAnd while it has always included Litecoin since its inception, it recently\nintegrated MWEB balances, paving the way for full MWEB swaps once Litecoin's\nupcoming core update — which will detect incoming Litecoin transactions using\nonly the viewkey without requiring the spendkey — goes live.\n\nTrade Litecoin on BasicSwap DEX (Litecoin DEX)By integrating BasicSwap into\nParticl Marketplace, alternative payment options are introduced at the time of\ncheckout, allowing users to seamlessly pay for items using their preferred\ncryptocurrency, a prime candidate of which being the fast and private Litecoin\nMWEB token.\n\nThis synergy aligns perfectly with Litecoin's vision of becoming a viable and\npractical form of digital cash, providing an additional real-world use case that\nfurther solidifies its position.\n\nBuilding Bridges Between Cryptocurrencies\nThe upcoming integration of BasicSwap and Litecoin MWEB on Particl Marketplace\nexemplifies BasicSwap's broader mission of forging bridges between diverse\ncryptocurrency communities and projects through its cross-chain functionality.\nThis synergy unites our efforts toward a shared vision of building a global\neconomy that prioritizes sovereignty and interoperability - the great promise of\ncrypto.\n\nBy enabling the use of Litecoin on Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap fosters a\nsymbiotic relationship that holds immense promise.

This is the future\nof BasicSwap, the atomic swap-based decentralized exchange that promises to be a\ncornerstone of the Particl ecosystem, and a catalyst for the growth of\ndecentralized commerce.\n\nThe Particl Ecosystem: A Beacon of Privacy Against Fiat\nParticl, through a multitude of modular privacy apps, can be understood as an\necosystem designed to respect individuals’ rights, freedoms, and privacy without\ncompromise. \n\nAt the core of the Particl project is the Particl Marketplace, a decentralized\ne-commerce platform that allows buyers and sellers to transact directly without\nintermediaries. This platform is complemented by a suite of privacy-focused\nprotocols that enable users to conduct various activities without relying on\nthird-party service providers.\n\nHowever, as Particl seeks to establish itself as a truly independent and\nself-sustaining ecosystem, a glaring issue has been a lack of avenues for\ninteracting effectively with the Marketplace, and the accessibility shortcomings\nthis represents. \n\nUntil recently, users have had to rely on centralized exchanges or unprotected\nover-the-counter (OTC) deals to acquire PART, the native currency of Particl\nMarketplace settlements, which undermines the platform's core principles of\nprivacy and autonomy.\n\nBridging the Gap: Bringing Decentralized Commerce to All Crypto\nWhile BasicSwap currently functions as an open-source decentralized exchange\napplication designed to facilitate trustless and anonymous trading of digital\nassets for all, its essence transcends that of a mere application; it is\nprimarily a protocol. This distinction, though seemingly minor on the surface,\ncarries profound implications for the future usage and purpose of BasicSwap.\n\nBy integrating it with the Particl Marketplace, thus providing to it\nBasicSwap-powered swap services such as a multi-currency payment option during\ncheckout, it promises to bridge the gap between privacy and decentralized\ncommerce, enabling users to interact with the Particl Marketplace using their\npreferred currency, while seamlessly converting the payment into PART in order\nto interact with certain aspects of the marketplace itself, such as Particl’s\nunique two-party escrow system\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-marketplace/marketplace_escrow.html]\n. The end result is a smooth experience where customers can pay for items in\ntheir preferred currency, which is then converted into PART in the background,\nproviding value to both the end-user and the Particl community of holders.\n\nBenefits that Extend Beyond the Usefulness of Multi-Currency Payments\nOne of the key advantages of BasicSwap is its ability to leverage atomic swap\ntechnology, specifically adaptor signatures, to allow users to exchange\ndifferent cryptocurrencies privately and without the need for a centralized\nintermediary. This not only enhances user security, it also opens up new\npossibilities for inter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects\nand their unique benefits.\n\nImagine a scenario where you wish to purchase an item on the Particl Marketplace\nusing Firo, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that employs the Lelantus protocol\nfor anonymity. With BasicSwap, you can initiate the transaction by sending your\nFiro to a designated address provided by the DEX. \n\nThe coins are then \"burned,\" and the Firo redeem token is exchanged for\nanonymous PART using BasicSwap, which is then used to complete the purchase on\nthe Particl Marketplace. Of course, all of this would happen behind the scenes,\nthe end-user being left with an easy-to-follow and comprehensive user experience\nakin to choosing a “checkout option” on traditional marketplaces.\n\nThis simple act demonstrates the power of atomic swap technology, effectively\ncombining the unique benefits of whatever coin is used as the checkout payment\noption (Firo, Monero, Litecoin MWEB, etc) and RingCT (the privacy protocol used\nby PART) in a single transaction. \n\nBy enabling such inter-compatibility between privacy technologies, BasicSwap\nunlocks a world of possibilities for users seeking to maintain their financial\nprivacy while engaging in decentralized commerce.\n\nThe Implications of a Truly Decentralized and Agnostic Payment System\nWhile the focus of BasicSwap is on bridging privacy projects and privacy coins,\nits true potential extends far beyond this scope. By offering a truly\ndecentralized and agnostic payment system, the BasicSwap protocol opens the door\nto a wide range of use cases and possibilities.\n\nOne exciting prospect is the integration of stablecoins, which could provide a\nmore stable and predictable means of value transfer within the Particl\necosystem. This could be particularly beneficial for e-commerce transactions,\nwhere price volatility can be a concern when cryptocurrency is involved.\n\nMoreover, the potential for anonymous stablecoins, or of anonymous swaps of\nexisting stablecoins, raises intriguing possibilities for enhancing financial\nprivacy while maintaining the benefits of price stability. As the technology\nevolves, BasicSwap's agnostic nature positions it to seamlessly integrate and\nfacilitate the use of such innovative financial instruments within the Particl\nMarketplace and beyond.\n\nConclusion: A Cornerstone for Decentralized Commerce\nThe integration of BasicSwap with the Particl Marketplace represents a\nsignificant milestone in our journey towards financial sovereignty. By providing\na robust and decentralized platform for trading PART and facilitating\ninter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects, BasicSwap is\npoised to become a cornerstone of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nAs the world increasingly recognizes the importance of privacy and autonomy in\nfinancial transactions, platforms like Particl and BasicSwap are poised to lead\nthe way in fostering a truly decentralized and privacy-focused economic\nenvironment. \n\nWith its commitment to agnosticism and its ability to adapt to emerging\ntechnologies, BasicSwap has the potential to revolutionize the way we think\nabout decentralized commerce, paving the way for a future where individuals can\ntransact freely, securely, and without the need for trusted third parties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

Using their own breakthrough protocol,\nAthanor was able to deal with the unique limitations that both XMR and ETH bring\nto the table, to achieve for the first time a bona fide atomic swap between the\ntwo currencies. And while there are some code-related hurdles and considerations\nto integrate her swap into the BasicSwap environment, *how* her ETH-XMR swap\nworks and what it reveals about the peculiarities of Ethereum is significantly\nmore interesting for our purposes.\n\nUnder The Hood\nXMR, of course, and as we’ve discussed at length\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n, has no scripting language. For that reason, the classic HTLC swap\n[https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/], where both coins need some\nbasic smart contract capabilities, is out of contention.\n\nETH considerations are of an entirely different order. It could seem to people\nfamiliar with the semi-scriptless adaptor signature protocol\n[https://medium.com/crypto-garage/adaptor-signature-schnorr-signature-and-ecdsa-da0663c2adc4] \nthat the highly scriptable Ethereum would satisfy all possible requirements that\nthe “script side” of the ECDSA adaptor signature scheme entails; however, as\nalways, the devil is in the details.\n\nAs it happens, the adaptor signature swap, or at least the semi-scriptless\nadaptor signature scheme that was designed to work with ECDSA curves, is as of\ntoday fundamentally incompatible with Ethereum. The reason, as it turns out, is\nthat Ethereum is account-based\n[https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/], and not UTXO-based.\n\nThe Challenges of an Account-based Architecture\nIn short, when a transaction is initiated in this model, it prompts nodes to\ndecrease the sender's account balance and increase the receiver's account\nbalance accordingly. To safeguard against replay attacks in account-based\ntransaction models, each transaction is associated with a unique nonce\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonce.asp]. To that end, the nonce is\npublicly visible and intrinsically linked to a transaction. This ensures that\nthe same transaction cannot be submitted more than once.\n\nThis breaks the adaptor signature scheme. The adaptor signature model requires\nrefund transactions to be pre-signed; but for ethereum, you cannot pre-sign a\ntransaction without knowing the nonce. Due to this, one of the parties could\nthen send a transaction in between the moment when the pre-signing was done and\nwhen the transaction was executed - which would invalidate the pre-signed\ntransaction (as the nonce was already used, and cannot be used twice).\n\nPre-signing in adaptor signature swapsAthanorLab's solution is to make use of\nEthereum smart contracts themselves, in order to support the entirety of the\nswap without adaptor signature logic. It is, in that sense, also semi-scriptless\n- but whereas the elegant and impenetrable adaptor signature carries the\nnecessary logic to achieve the XMR swap, the ETH swap counterpart is carried by\nthe powerful capabilities of Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nPrivacy-wise, this means the anonymity set of the ETH swap is stronger than HTLC\n(where contracts can be found on both sides of the swap), but less so than\nadaptor signatures, due to the need for a public contract on one side. On the\nside without a contract, a swap transaction looks the same as any other\ntransaction. But on the side with the contract, while it is evident that the\ntransaction is for a swap, it is impossible to trace it to the other chain, even\nwith sophisticated chain analysis tools.\n\nSo, while BasicSwap has under its belt the GUI, order book and all the internal\nlogic needed to propagate and make available atomic swap trades of all kinds —\nincluding Ethereum — the two types of swaps it currently supports are both\ninadequate for Ethereum swaps. Such a feat, while conceivable, will require a\nfull integration of Elizabeth’s protocol, or a similar protocol, into BasicSwap.\n\nA snapshot of BasicSwap's orderbook GUI, powered by the SMSG networkCurrent\nProtocol Limitations\nAn important setback of ETH-RingCT swaps, as the protocol stands right now, is\nthat ETH providers are not able to publish offers they're willing to engage in.\nThat means that, like the adaptor signature swap that had a similar issue, only\none side can publish trades - in this case, the RingCT side. \n\nThe RingCT side, in this case XMR, has no scripting, and thus no way to refund\nin case the counterparty backs out – whereas for ETH, if the ETH-holder locks\nfirst, they can refund if the XMR-holder backs out. However, if the XMR-holder\nlocks first and the ETH-holder only then backs out, then their funds are locked\nforever. This means that the swap itself always has to be structured in one way,\nwith XMR as the initial offerer, similar to how adaptor signature swaps work at\nthe protocol level.\n\nAnother underlying issue here, and the reason why ETH holders cannot even\nadvertise offers for entering into a swap, is because of the gas fees of the\nEthereum contract itself. Gas fees, of course, should be expected to be provided\nfor by the ETH side of the transaction, and not the XMR side. This is another\nreason why the XMR-holder must initiate the swap, as the cost for the ETH-holder\nto lock is significantly higher than for the XMR-holder – the former could\neasily be griefed if someone repeatedly were to take an advertised offer, or\nmultiple offers, and back out.\n\nThis unidirectional restriction is problematic: the offerer dictates the swap's\nparameters, including the offered and requested coins, their respective\nquantities, and the exchange rate. That means ETH holders, in this context, have\nlittle say on the parameters of any given swap, and are subject to the\npreferences of XMR holders to achieve a swap. \n\nAthanorLab's XMR-ETH swap current command-line interfaceLooking Ahead\nMuch like was done with the XMR-BTC swap, BasicSwap's intention is to leverage\nthe SMSG network in order to assess the current limitations of the proposed\nXMR-ETH swap protocol.\n\nBidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) Atomic Swaps Now Live on BasicSwap DEX\nBidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) atomic swaps now live on BasicSwap DEX.\nParticl NewsCangrejo\n[https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\nRemember, our solution to achieve bidirectionality for XMR-BTC atomic swaps\ndidn't hinge on modifying the Monero codebase or its adaptor signature atomic\nswap protocol. Instead, we leveraged the SMSG network to simulate offers\nfeaturing Monero\n[https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n. In reality, BasicSwap still employs the same semi-scriptless protocol — hence,\nat the protocol level, the swap remains unidirectional. However, by integrating\nan additional automated step into the swap process — powered by the SMSG network\n— we've made it appear as if Monero can now be offered.\n\nEven though it is fundamentally a clever workaround, essentially providing the \nillusion of a truly bidirectional swap, it is entirely seamless for the end user\nand doesn't necessitate any additional manual input or requirements.\n\nThis is all very exciting — the presence of ETH tokens would certainly prove a\npowerful addition to the BasicSwap ecosystem, and eventually to the Particl\nMarketplace, as it would open decentralized commerce to the entire Ethereum\necosystem. Furthermore, although a lot of work and testing are still ahead\nbefore this becomes a reality, the unique interaction of atomic swaps and\nBasicSwap's decentralized orderbook could once again prove to be key in\nachieving bidirectional swaps for a semi-scriptless protocol with substantial\nlimitations.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you wish to look into the ETH-XMR Atomic Swap protocol in more technical\ndetail, you can check out the project's Github\n[https://github.com/AthanorLabs/atomic-swap]\n[https://github.com/AthanorLabs/atomic-swap] or join their Element room\n[https://matrix.to/#/#ethxmrswap:matrix.org]. \n\nThe protocol is still in its early phases, having been out to the public for\nslightly more than 3 months, and they would certainly welcome knowledgeable beta\ntesters and people willing to contribute end relays to this ongoing experiment!\nThe project is open source and at the forefront of atomic swap technology, and\nevery little bit helps.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you would like to deepen your understanding of atomic swaps and their\nhistory, make sure to give these articles a read!\n\n * Atomic Swap Style Showdown [https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/]\n * The DEX Revolution Pt. 1\n   [https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n * The DEX Revolution Pt. 2\n   [https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-basicswap-and-web-access-considerations/]\n * Bidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) Atomic Swaps\n   [https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

And while there are some code-related hurdles and considerations to integrate her swap into the BasicSwap environment, *how* her ETH-XMR swap works and what it reveals about the peculiarities of Ethereum is significantly more interesting for our purposes.</p><h3 id=\"under-the-hood\">Under The Hood</h3><p>XMR, of course, and <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/\">as we’ve discussed at length</a>, has no scripting language. For that reason, the classic <a href=\"https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/\">HTLC swap</a>, where both coins need some basic smart contract capabilities, is out of contention.</p><p>ETH considerations are of an entirely different order. It could seem to people familiar with the <a href=\"https://medium.com/crypto-garage/adaptor-signature-schnorr-signature-and-ecdsa-da0663c2adc4\">semi-scriptless adaptor signature protocol</a> that the highly scriptable Ethereum would satisfy all possible requirements that the “script side” of the ECDSA adaptor signature scheme entails; however, as always, the devil is in the details.</p><p>As it happens, the adaptor signature swap, or at least the semi-scriptless adaptor signature scheme that was designed to work with ECDSA curves, is as of today fundamentally incompatible with Ethereum. The reason, as it turns out, is that Ethereum is <strong><a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/\">account-based</a>,</strong> and not UTXO-based.</p><h3 id=\"the-challenges-of-an-account-based-architecture\">The Challenges of an Account-based Architecture</h3><p>In short, when a transaction is initiated in this model, it prompts nodes to decrease the sender's account balance and increase the receiver's account balance accordingly. To safeguard against replay attacks in account-based transaction models, each transaction is associated with a unique <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonce.asp\">nonce</a>. To that end, the nonce is publicly visible and intrinsically linked to a transaction. This ensures that the same transaction cannot be submitted more than once.</p><p>This breaks the adaptor signature scheme. The adaptor signature model requires refund transactions to be pre-signed; but for ethereum, you cannot pre-sign a transaction without knowing the nonce. Due to this, one of the parties could then send a transaction in between the moment when the pre-signing was done and when the transaction was executed - which would invalidate the pre-signed transaction (as the nonce was already used, and cannot be used twice).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QKqxfInsv6MoLt4G8DYAoCb0HYjFjci3sschANKgkLhq-6U4UyxOUNaC-xraWSls-jEZgGP1wZXpS3gHDtXtQM10K0KGfaHUdjGzFHXRxnBSaAA0e8gOcAjZe8wEKWz7rEYkLCOrsrsmmupTk7-O4k8\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><em>Pre-signing in adaptor signature swaps</em></figcaption></figure><p>AthanorLab's solution is to make use of Ethereum smart contracts themselves, in order to support the entirety of the swap without adaptor signature logic. It is, in that sense, also semi-scriptless - but whereas the elegant and impenetrable adaptor signature carries the necessary logic to achieve the XMR swap, the ETH swap counterpart is carried by the powerful capabilities of Ethereum smart contracts.</p><p>Privacy-wise, this means the anonymity set of the ETH swap is stronger than HTLC (where contracts can be found on both sides of the swap), but less so than adaptor signatures, due to the need for a public contract on one side. On the side without a contract, a swap transaction looks the same as any other transaction. But on the side with the contract, while it is evident that the transaction is for a swap, it is impossible to trace it to the other chain, even with sophisticated chain analysis tools.</p><p>So, while BasicSwap has under its belt the GUI, order book and all the internal logic needed to propagate and make available atomic swap trades of all kinds — including Ethereum — the two types of swaps it currently supports are both inadequate for Ethereum swaps. Such a feat, while conceivable, will require a full integration of Elizabeth’s protocol, or a similar protocol, into BasicSwap.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2023/08/image-13.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2023/08/image-13.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2023/08/image-13.png 1000w, /glink/2023/08/image-13.png 1394w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption><em>A snapshot of BasicSwap's orderbook GUI, powered by the SMSG network</em></figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"current-protocol-limitations\">Current Protocol Limitations</h3><p>An important setback of ETH-RingCT swaps, as the protocol stands right now, is that ETH providers are not able to publish offers they're willing to engage in. That means that, like the adaptor signature swap that had a similar issue, only one side can publish trades - in this case, the RingCT side. </p><p>The RingCT side, in this case XMR, has no scripting, and thus no way to refund in case the counterparty backs out – whereas for ETH, if the ETH-holder locks first, they can refund if the XMR-holder backs out. However, if the XMR-holder locks first and the ETH-holder only then backs out, then their funds are locked forever. This means that <strong>the swap itself always has to be structured in one way</strong>, with XMR as the initial offerer, similar to how adaptor signature swaps work at the protocol level.</p><p>Another underlying issue here, and the reason why ETH holders cannot even advertise offers for entering into a swap, is because of the gas fees of the Ethereum contract itself. Gas fees, of course, should be expected to be provided for by the ETH side of the transaction, and not the XMR side. This is another reason why the XMR-holder must initiate the swap, as the cost for the ETH-holder to lock is significantly higher than for the XMR-holder – the former could easily be griefed if someone repeatedly were to take an advertised offer, or multiple offers, and back out.</p><p>This unidirectional restriction is problematic: the offerer dictates the swap's parameters, including the offered and requested coins, their respective quantities, and the exchange rate. That means ETH holders, in this context, have little say on the parameters of any given swap, and are subject to the preferences of XMR holders to achieve a swap. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2023/08/image-9.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2023/08/image-9.png 600w, /glink/2023/08/image-9.png 981w\"><figcaption><em>AthanorLab's XMR-ETH swap current command-line interface</em></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"looking-ahead\">Looking Ahead</h2><p>Much like was done with the XMR-BTC swap, <strong>BasicSwap's intention is to leverage the SMSG network in order to assess the current limitations of the proposed XMR-ETH swap protocol</strong>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Bidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) Atomic Swaps Now Live on BasicSwap DEX</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Bidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) atomic swaps now live on BasicSwap DEX.</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://particl.news/icons/icon-512x512.png\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Particl News</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">Cangrejo</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://particl.news/static/18420229ea02ad69f34759df50d149e3/bidireciton_medium.jpg\"></div></a></figure><p>Remember, our solution to achieve bidirectionality for XMR-BTC atomic swaps didn't hinge on modifying the Monero codebase or its adaptor signature atomic swap protocol.

solutions without central points of failure in\norder to bring the industry back to its roots and core ethos — namely, privacy\nand decentralization. \n\nAs it stands, the increasingly centralized and corporate infrastructure of\ncrypto not only renders it more vulnerable to attacks, but it also gives\ngovernment entities such as the SEC an incredibly powerful vector of control. To\nthat end, it can be stated that atomic swaps represent the most decentralized\nand potentially most private way to exchange cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn the previous installment\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n\nof this series\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n, we discussed the history and development of atomic swap technologies, and the\ntechnical peculiarities and challenges of integrating them within a\ncomprehensive DEX framework like BasicSwap DEX. Similar challenges are also\npresent in bringing the BasicSwap protocol towards web accessibility, which we\nwill explore in this article.\n\nA Foundation for Private and Accessible DEX Environments\nBasicSwapDEXMeet BasicSwap, the privacy-first and cross-chain DEX. Swap coins\nlike Bitcoin and Monero on a trading platform that’s free, unstoppable, and\nconfidential. By the Particl Project.BasicSwapDEX [https://basicswapdex.com/]\nThose familiar with the early beta of the BasicSwap protocol\n[https://particl.news/basicswaps-gui-2-0-2-now-available/] understand that,\nwhile the technology is incredibly powerful and allows for probably the easiest\nXMR-BTC [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqwgAcJrKDE] or\nPart(ANON)-BTC decentralized swaps available anywhere\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqwgAcJrKDE], it is at the cost of a relatively\ninvolved process. For example, unless you wish to swap a coin pair which\nblockchains you have already downloaded, the time necessary to get a new\nblockchain up to speed can be impractical for many users. Furthermore, simply\naccessing or updating the BasicSwap application requires much more time and\nattention than accessing a website would, which can be a key decision factor for\nmany.\n\nThankfully, accessibility and onboarding improvements — notably a more\nstraightforward and less complicated install process\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-16-06-2023/#basicswap-] \n— are on the horizon, and will no doubt help less technically savvy but\nparticularly privacy-concerned users to achieve the swaps they want directly on\nthe BasicSwap platform. To that end, it is important to remember that the\nBasicSwap desktop application will always be a direct and uncompromising mirror\nto the BasicSwap protocol itself, and as such, will likely always require users\nto connect directly with chains, whether at the local level or through light\nservices or nodes. This is the nature of atomic swaps, and the price users have\nto pay for free, entirely decentralized cross-chain atomic swaps with no third\nparties involved at any point.\n\nIn addition to the powerful decentralized swap machine that the BasicSwap\napplication already is, and despite all upcoming improvements, an important\nfeature is that the base protocol remains wide open to the inclusion of\nadditional access gateways and integrations — namely, in the case of our current\ndevelopment focus, a web-based portal to the decentralized HTLC and Adaptor Sig\nswaps [https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/] available on the BSX\nnetwork. \n\nThe goal of such a gateway into the protocol is two-fold: on one hand, a\nplug-and-play type of web accessibility for effective cross-chain atomic swaps,\nwhich addresses some of the limitations that the application itself poses; on\nthe other, a continued commitment to the privacy and decentralized resilience\nthat characterizes BasicSwap and the Particl project as a whole.\n\nOur Vision for BasicSwap's Access Gateways\n\nTo honor this commitment to privacy and resilience, integrating the BasicSwap\nprotocol into a comprehensive web-based DEX framework hinges on a few things.\n\nFirst of all is our commitment to make as little compromise as possible with\nregards to decentralization. The resilience and lack of third parties are some\nof the most attractive aspects of current atomic swap technologies, and we must\nkeep that in mind for users that wish to benefit from BasicSwap directly from\nthe convenience of a simple, easy-to-use website. To that end, general\ntransparency, such as the easy and independent verification of addresses,\nsmart-contracts, and on-chain processes by the user, and the immutable and\npeer-to-peer nature of the SMSG network, go a long way.\n\nA second important consideration to achieve the goal of a thriving web-based\nBasicSwap access gateway is liquidity providers. Our vision is to enable web\nusers to perform swaps, not only from regular users on the main BasicSwap order\nbook, but also from liquidity providers potentially using their own private\norder books, which also live on the BasicSwap DEX protocol. To that end,\ninvesting development and resources into liquidity tools, initiatives, and\nincentives will be of great benefit to any DEX integration and will be\ninstrumental in creating a fluid, reliable and incredibly resilient web-based\nDEX.\n\nThirdly, continuing our commitment to modular software architecture\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/] will ensure the\nexceptional resilience and scalability of even a web-based atomic swap platform\nvia the future integration of additional messaging layers to support the SMSG\nnetwork (1\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex#securemessaging-smsg-network]\n, 2 [https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/])\nin the event that a defective or inadequate module fails to live up to the high\nexpectations of BasicSwap DEX. This design philosophy also makes the platform\nmore scalable, both at the gateway level and at the protocol level.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDeveloping the Economy of Tomorrow\nAlthough the BasicSwap protocol itself is still in beta and that many of the\nnecessary building blocks towards a smooth, user-friendly atomic swap web DEX\nare still in the works, behind-the-scenes development of BasicSwap is going\nsplendidly, and a working beta of such a revolutionary web-based exchange\nplatform is well in progress. Be sure to stay tuned to our twitter\n[https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1677371987675471890] to stay up to\ndate with our weekly Friday development reports!\n\nAddressing the peculiarities of a web-based BasicSwap gateway also brings us\ncloser to its integration into the Particl Marketplace\n[https://particl.io/marketplace], which will allow for seamless swaps between\nother digital currencies and the $PART settlement coin. This aims to bring\ndeCommerce to unprecedented levels of accessibility and resilience, even\nallowing users to compound the privacy benefits of multiple cryptos and swapping\nprotocols — a formidable building block towards a common, truly decentralized\nfinancial system open to all.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you would like to deepen your understanding of atomic swaps and their\nhistory, make sure to give these articles a read!\n\n * Atomic Swap Style Showdown [https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/]\n * The DEX Revolution Pt. 1\n   [https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n * The DEX Revolution Pt. 3\n   [https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-basicswap-and-private-ethereum-swaps/]\n * Bidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) Atomic Swaps\n   [https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

For example, unless you wish to swap a coin pair which blockchains you have already downloaded, the time necessary to get a new blockchain up to speed can be impractical for many users. Furthermore, simply accessing or updating the BasicSwap application requires much more time and attention than accessing a website would, which can be a key decision factor for many.</p><p>Thankfully, accessibility and onboarding improvements — notably <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-16-06-2023/#basicswap-\">a more straightforward and less complicated install process</a> — are on the horizon, and will no doubt help less technically savvy but particularly privacy-concerned users to achieve the swaps they want directly on the BasicSwap platform. To that end, it is important to remember that the BasicSwap desktop application will always be a direct and uncompromising mirror to the BasicSwap protocol itself, and as such, will likely always require users to connect directly with chains, whether at the local level or through light services or nodes. This is the nature of atomic swaps, and the price users have to pay for free, entirely decentralized cross-chain atomic swaps with no third parties involved at any point.</p><p>In addition to the powerful decentralized swap machine that the BasicSwap application already is, and despite all upcoming improvements, an important feature is that the base protocol remains wide open to the inclusion of additional access gateways and integrations — namely, in the case of our current development focus, a web-based portal to the decentralized <a href=\"https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/\">HTLC and Adaptor Sig swaps</a> available on the BSX network. </p><p>The goal of such a gateway into the protocol is two-fold: on one hand, a plug-and-play type of web accessibility for effective cross-chain atomic swaps, which addresses some of the limitations that the application itself poses; on the other, a continued commitment to the privacy and decentralized resilience that characterizes BasicSwap and the Particl project as a whole.</p><h2 id=\"our-vision-for-basicswap-s-access-gateways\">Our Vision for BasicSwap's Access Gateways</h2><p><br>To honor this commitment to privacy and resilience, integrating the BasicSwap protocol into a comprehensive web-based DEX framework hinges on a few things.</p><p>First of all is our commitment to make as little compromise as possible with regards to decentralization. The resilience and lack of third parties are some of the most attractive aspects of current atomic swap technologies, and we must keep that in mind for users that wish to benefit from BasicSwap directly from the convenience of a simple, easy-to-use website. To that end, general transparency, such as the easy and independent verification of addresses, smart-contracts, and on-chain processes by the user, and the immutable and peer-to-peer nature of the SMSG network, go a long way.</p><p>A second important consideration to achieve the goal of a thriving web-based BasicSwap access gateway is liquidity providers. Our vision is to enable web users to perform swaps, not only from regular users on the main BasicSwap order book, but also from liquidity providers potentially using their own private order books, which also live on the BasicSwap DEX protocol. To that end, investing development and resources into liquidity tools, initiatives, and incentives will be of great benefit to any DEX integration and will be instrumental in creating a fluid, reliable and incredibly resilient web-based DEX.</p><p>Thirdly, continuing <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/\">our commitment to modular software architecture</a> will ensure the exceptional resilience and scalability of even a web-based atomic swap platform via the future integration of additional messaging layers to support the SMSG network (<a href=\"https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex#securemessaging-smsg-network\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\">2</a>) in the event that a defective or inadequate module fails to live up to the high expectations of BasicSwap DEX. This design philosophy also makes the platform more scalable, both at the gateway level and at the protocol level.</p><hr><h2 id=\"developing-the-economy-of-tomorrow\">Developing the Economy of Tomorrow</h2><p>Although the BasicSwap protocol itself is still in beta and that many of the necessary building blocks towards a smooth, user-friendly atomic swap web DEX are still in the works, behind-the-scenes development of BasicSwap is going splendidly, and a working beta of such a revolutionary web-based exchange platform is well in progress.

increasingly attractive\nalternative to centralized exchanges in cryptocurrency trades. The spectacular\nfailures of some centralized exchanges, like the Celsius debacle or last\nwinter’s implosion of the FTX exchange where billions of dollars of customer’s\nfunds were stolen obviously does nothing to help this climate.\n\nThere is, at the heart of the CEX vs DEX dynamic, a fundamental divide; while\nbig centralized entities suit traditional market logic, and can adapt these\nprinciples to fuel their own growth, they go against the fundamental principle\nof blockchain and cryptocurrency itself: private, peer-to-peer money.\n\nA Path Ahead\nIt could be argued that atomic swaps represent the most decentralized,\npotentially most private way to exchange cryptocurrencies. They are, of course,\nextremely resilient — as long as the blockchain accepts your transaction and you\nhave a reliable, hopefully private way to communicate with the other person, you\ncan swap. This, in effect, makes them exactly as decentralized as the\nblockchains involved. It also opens the door to entirely eliminating trust from\nthe process, unlike centralized models where you have to trust entities such as\nBinance, Celsius or FTX, and give them full control of your keys.\n\nIt was the Decred team who first made this technology a practical reality\n[https://github.com/decred/atomicswap], with their implementation of the first\nHTLC-based atomic swaps. At their core, HTLC swaps are easy to understand. They\ninvolve 'Hashed Timelock Contracts', which are types of smart contracts, on both\nthe buyer and seller sides. This means that both blockchains must have Timelock\nand Hashlock capabilities.\n\nBesides this limiting requirement, the HTLC swap also lacks privacy. While it\nallows for trustless, atomic swap exchanges to exist, it also creates a new\nproblem with it: when making a swap, a secret is created, hashed out, and\ninscribed, minutes apart, in the blockchains of both participating blockchains.\nThe problem here is that while this allows the protocol to verify the\ntransaction and move through the next steps of a swap, it also makes it trivial\nfor outside observers to infer the two participants of a swap, as well as what\namount of money is being exchanged. Here, an important privacy issue must be\naddressed.\n\nPoint Time Locked Contract Swaps and Adaptor Signatures\nAn important stepping stone to making atomic swaps the trustless, decentralized\nand hyper-private powerhouse that it can be lays in adaptor signatures.\n\nAs we explored in this piece [https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/],\nthe adaptor signature atomic swap scheme, otherwise referable to as \"Point Time\nLocked Contract (PTLC) swaps, begins with Andrew Poelstra’s work on scriptless\nscripts. Poelstra’s work was born out of necessity to interact with\nMimbleWimble, an extremely rigid blockchain protocol. These scriptless scripts\nexploit the linear nature of Schnorr signatures\n[https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/introduction-schnorr-signatures]: by\nusing Schnorr signatures in clever ways that are expanded further in this\narticle [https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/], or in greater\ntechnical detail here [https://hongchao.me/scriptless-script/].\n\nPoelstra’s work, in any case, makes it possible to replicate certain smart\ncontract capabilities without needing any of the actual smart contract language\na given coin may have. The adaptor signature swap, as such, is an example of a\nscriptless script.\n\nHowever, and this is important, Bitcoin and Monero do not use Schnorr signatures\nin its cryptographic signature algorithm — instead, they use a classic Elliptic\nCurve Digital Signature Algorithm, or ECDSA. There are a lot of differences\nbetween the two that we will not get into today, but suffice to say, adaptor\nsignature swaps on blockchain protocols using ECDSA curves, like Particl's PART,\nwould fall under the category of \"semi-scriptless protocols\n[https://medium.com/crypto-garage/adaptor-signature-on-ecdsa-cac148dfa3ad]\".\n\nThere is a huge benefit here compared to HTLC swaps, other than the fact that it\nenables PART's anon transaction type and other RingCT coins such as XMR to be\natomically swapped: they do not rely on identical hashes that need to be\ninscribed on the participating blockchains.\n\nOf course, in the case of RingCT based coins, that wouldn’t be much of a problem\neven if we were able to swap them using traditional HTLC swaps — which, again,\nis not possible on ECDSA schemes — because the hashes would be completely\nhidden.\n\nBut the beautiful thing here is that adaptor signature swaps can actually apply\nto a vast number of cryptocurrencies, and at the same time, make the swaps much,\nmuch more private.\n\nPre-Signed Transactions\nAn important aspect to the adaptor signature swap scheme is the use of\npre-signed refund transactions to solve the inherent problem of incomplete\nswaps, and achieve trustless, infallible atomic swaps while operating within the\nconfines of semi-scriptless protocols.\n\nPre-signing the refund transaction, addressing the XMR-BTC unhappy path problem.\nLet’s take a look at an atomic swap where Alice tries to swap 1 BTC with Bob for\n1 XMR. The first thing they do is pre-sign the refund transactions for Bitcoin.\nThis can be compared to signing the divorce papers before you get married. This\nallows them to split amicably even if one disappears and leaves the other\nstranded. Now at that very moment in time, the refund transaction is useless\nbecause they haven't deposited any money — much like you cannot file a divorce\nif you’ve never gotten married in the first place.\n\nThis is mandatory to making adaptor signature based swaps a functional reality\nin the real world, as any widespread implementations needs to account for\nincomplete swaps, interrupted flows, and other \"unhappy\" paths.\n\nAdditional Privacy and Scalability Improvements\nDuring the implementation of adaptor signature-based swaps into the BasicSwap\nDEX, we scrutinized the code to identify possible improvements that could be\nincorporated into the technology. The creation of this novel atomic swap type\nhas been a testament to open-source collaboration, and it's only fitting that we\ncontribute back to the community.\n\nAnd so, we ended up identifying a method to boost the privacy of PTLC swaps\nfurther and decrease the transaction size by adjusting a specific code segment.\n\nOriginal logic:\n\nOP_IF\n\tOP_SHA256 <hs> OP_EQUALVERIFY\n\t2 <Ba> <Bb> 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG\nOP_ELSE\n\t<t0> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP\n\t2 <Bra> <Brb> 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG\nOP_ENDIF\n\nSource:\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap/master/whitepaper/xmr-btc.pdf\nSimplified logic:\n\n2 <Ba> <Bb> 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG\n\nWith this change, adaptor signature-based swaps now look like any other 2-of-2\nmulti-signature transaction on the blockchain.

upcoming Monerotopia speech\n[https://monerotopia.com/], and expanding on some of the topics raised in this\nprevious article [https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/]\n, this article goes over our thoughts on privacy and interoperability in\nprivacy-centric projects.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe current state of the world is a cause for great concern, particularly for\nthose who support freedom and oppose censorship, value independent thought, and\nprioritize personal privacy. Global economies are facing an unprecedented\ncrisis, and governments are enacting increasingly oppressive measures that\nthreaten individual autonomy, even discussing outright bans on encryption. It is\nbecoming increasingly difficult to protect one's freedom on a daily basis.\n\nFortunately, the advent of Bitcoin provided a glimmer of hope. In the years to\ncome, the release of Bitcoin may likely be viewed as one of the most influential\nevents in modern history, given that blockchain and decentralized networks\nprovide us with concrete tools to resist those who seek to restrict our rights\nand freedoms.\n\nWhen Satoshi Nakamoto brought this incredible gift to the world, humanity stood\non the precipice. However, Satoshi's legacy now rests with us, as we continue to\npush the boundaries of privacy coins by adding more robust obfuscation layers\nand anonymizing transactions, thereby preventing cryptocurrencies from becoming\na financial surveillance tool.\n\nUltimately, the cypherpunk mission, as bold as it is, is to build a parallel\neconomy, completely independent and separate from the global fiat system, in\nwhich its users can accomplish their everyday needs without having to depend on\nlegacy financial systems anymore.\n\nThis article is about the survival of our privacy and liberties within a world\nthat is actively seeking to destroy them and what we believe the path forward\nis.\n\nPrivacy, Intercompatibility, and Resilience\nCompetition can be a driving force for progress, motivating individuals to\nperform better, increase productivity, and push the boundaries of innovation,\nultimately resulting in enhanced benefits for end-users.\n\nHowever, while this holds true in crypto, it also creates avoidable tensions\nbetween projects and often leads to a situation where the innovations of one\nproject are overlooked by those who do not possess a financial stake in that\nparticular project. This division in the community limits our collective\ncapacity to address the imminent challenges to privacy that we previously\noutlined, a suboptimal outcome given the substantial force wielded by those who\nseek to undermine our freedoms.\n\nUltimately, to stand a chance against this opposition, we should strive to\nembrace our uniqueness and foster creativity; different projects working on\ndifferent ideas and solutions, but we must unite together in a decentralized,\nprivate, and free economy in which all of our projects thrive and can be\nintegrated.\n\nTo do just that, we are presently focused on a comprehensive improvement of our\necosystem codebase\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/], which is\ndesigned to reflect our core values. Among them:\n\n * Privacy, obviously.\n * Uncompromising decentralization.\n * And an agnostic approach to the protocols used and the compatible currencies\n   with which our dApps function.\n\nWith an agnostic approach, we can both encourage current and new privacy\nprojects to thrive and build new ideas, and unite them at the same time. This\nallows different projects to work independently, while at the same time existing\nwithin an ecosystem of decentralized protocols and applications that enjoys\nextremely high levels of interoperability and intercompatibility.\n\nEmbodying Agnosticism\nThe Particl project embodies agnosticism in two main aspects. For one, we are\ncurrently rebasing our entire codebase to make it completely modular, allowing\nfor various protocols, both native to Particl and external, to be used in order\nto power its dApps. We refer to this as “protocol agnosticism”.\n\nFor instance, consider how Particl dApps employ data layers: we have our own\nnative SMSG, with an advanced SMSG 2.0 version currently in development. Our\nmodular approach ensures that our dApps are designed in a neutral manner, and\nonly request data from 'a data layer module,' which is currently provided by an\nSMSG module by default. However, this can be easily changed.\n\nAdopting this philosophy allows developers to choose between SMSG or any other\ncompatible data layer module when selecting a data layer module for their dApps.\nThe final decision depends on the developer's preferences and the requirements\nof their dApp, as each solution provides a unique set of pros and cons.\n\nThis not only makes dApps more flexible and better adapted to their specific use\ncases, it also introduces an array of features, functionalities, and benefits to\nParticl dApps and their users that other projects other than Particl itself have\nworked on.\n\nIt also makes them more resilient.\nConsider the current iteration of BasicSwap DEX, which utilizes SMSG to enable\nits distributed order book and match orders between swap peers. Now, assume that\nSMSG gets hacked, spammed, or decrypted due to some unforeseen black swan event.\nAlthough such a circumstance could be a fatal blow to any dApp, it would be a\nminor setback for BasicSwap developers who could simply switch to an\nalternative, unaffected data layer. Moreover, in the case of BasicSwap, no user\nwould lose funds, since atomic swaps are refunded when either of the two peers\nfails to act in a timely manner.\n\nThis is just one example of how other ideas, protocols, services, and ideas\nother projects are working on can unite under a commonly shared goal without\ncompeting with each other but without having to start developing together. We\ncould sit here all night and just give an almost infinite number of examples,\nbut I think you get the gist.\n\nBecause technology advances so fast, we must build solutions that will endure\nthe test of time. By building agnostic solutions, we ALL become stronger,\ntogether, and we can promise lasting and resilient solutions to our users; the\nperfect embodiment of the open-source and cypherpunk ethos.\n\nHowever, our agnostic approach is not solely confined to developer modules.\nAfter all, we all operate in the realm of cryptocurrencies, and many of us have\nunique communities that hold our coins and prefer to use them whenever possible.\n\nIn our previous example, we highlighted what would be a data layer module in\nwhich SMSG, Nym, XX Network, and other mixnets could theoretically power Particl\ndApps. But to be truly “open to all”, and to accomplish our mission of unifying\nthe different blockchain projects working towards our shared goals of privacy\nand freedom, we have to go one step beyond that.\n\nCurrency Agnosticism \nCurrency agnosticism also offers us important bridging opportunities in\nprivacy-first environments. Let us take the Particl Marketplace as an example:\nyou can buy and sell anything online, privately and free of charge, and without\nthird-parties. But there is, for people holding their liquidity in completely\ndifferent coins, a caveat: you can currently only use the PART coin to do so.\nThis introduces friction, and forces users to reach out to outside platforms in\norder to acquire this specific coin.\n\nThat is an important limiting factor to our overall vision, which is why we’re\ncurrently focused on building integration frameworks and payment modules for\nother coins to be accepted as payments, using an integrated, modular, back-end\nswap protocol, but still using PART as the final settlement layer.\n\nWhile several quick fixes, such as centralized payment processors and exchanges,\ncan be adopted, reverting to centralized parties inevitably leads to sub-optimal\noutcomes and jeopardizes the entire ecosystem, as evidenced by the Changelly\ndebacle\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/saxdxk/dont_ever_use_changelly/] \nwithin the Monero community. To really fulfill our vision of a free,\nindependent, fully resilient and privacy-first economy without central points of\nfailure, every step has to be done in a decentralized and streamlined way.\n\nWhat Privacy Ramifications?\nWhile designing dApps to be currency-agnostic can provide new and thrilling\npossibilities for users from almost an infinite number of cryptocurrency\nprojects, it also offers much more than just convenience or a 'preferred\ncurrency for payments.'\n\nLet’s take Firo as an example. Firo (formerly known as Zcoin) is a\ncryptocurrency that stands out from the rest with its innovative privacy\ntechnology, Lelantus. This innovative feature allows users to make anonymous\ntransactions differently: whereas $PART uses RingCT that obfuscates transactions\nusing decoys, Firo’s Lelantus privacy technology allows users to burn their\ncoins, and the user can redeem then at any time for brand new ones using\nzero-knowledge proofs to prove that he has the right to redeem them.\n\nThis is a creative and novel way to enhance privacy, and it has its pros and\ncons, depending on the purpose of a private transaction, risk tolerance, and\ncosts. But one thing is sure, it becomes incredibly powerful when combined with\nother privacy setups.\n\nLet us, for example's sake, assume that there is an item on the Particl\nMarketplace that you want to purchase. Settlement must be done in PART, which\nuses RingCT as its privacy layer. However, ideally, you may initiate the\ntransaction using any currency.\n\nNow, imagine that you initiate the transaction using a Firo Lelantus\ntransaction. You specify this preference, and the Particl Marketplace provides\nyou with a Firo address, provided by the BasicSwap DEX, to which you can send\nthe coins to using Lelantus. The coins are then burned, and the FIRO redeem\ntoken is exchanged for anon PART using the BasicSwap DEX before being used to\nbuy the item on the marketplace.\n\nBy this simple act, you’ve essentially used atomic swap technology to combine\nboth Lelantus and RingCT in a single marketplace transaction, compounding both\nof their different and unique benefits with each other. This is only an example\nof what is possible by enabling and amplifying inter-compatibility in privacy\ntech.\n\nAgnosticism, PART, and the Particl Marketplace\nAlthough the focus is on bridging privacy projects and privacy coins together in\na truly open, highly accessible decentralized economic environment, the unique\nproperties of the PART token means it will always remain the settlement layer\nfor all Particl Marketplace transactions.\n\nThere are also, of course, benefits associated with this form of agnosticism via\nthe use of stablecoins, especially in the context of the Particl Marketplace,\nand perhaps even theoretical anonymous stablecoins in the future. It is clear\nthat the possibilities introduced by truly decentralized agnostic payment\nsystems are limitless.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

Among them:</p><ul><li>Privacy, obviously.</li><li>Uncompromising decentralization.</li><li>And an agnostic approach to the protocols used and the compatible currencies with which our dApps function.</li></ul><p>With an agnostic approach, we can both encourage current and new privacy projects to thrive and build new ideas, and unite them at the same time. This allows different projects to work independently, while at the same time existing within an ecosystem of decentralized protocols and applications that enjoys extremely high levels of interoperability and intercompatibility.</p><h2 id=\"embodying-agnosticism\">Embodying Agnosticism</h2><p>The Particl project embodies agnosticism in two main aspects. For one, we are currently rebasing our entire codebase to make it completely modular, allowing for various protocols, both native to Particl and external, to be used in order to power its dApps. We refer to this as “protocol agnosticism”.</p><p>For instance, consider how Particl dApps employ data layers: we have our own native SMSG, with an advanced SMSG 2.0 version currently in development. Our modular approach ensures that our dApps are designed in a neutral manner, and only request data from 'a data layer module,' which is currently provided by an SMSG module by default. However, this can be easily changed.</p><p>Adopting this philosophy allows developers to choose between SMSG or any other compatible data layer module when selecting a data layer module for their dApps. The final decision depends on the developer's preferences and the requirements of their dApp, as each solution provides a unique set of pros and cons.</p><p>This not only makes dApps more flexible and better adapted to their specific use cases, it also introduces an array of features, functionalities, and benefits to Particl dApps and their users that other projects other than Particl itself have worked on.</p><h3 id=\"it-also-makes-them-more-resilient-\">It also makes them more resilient.</h3><p>Consider the current iteration of BasicSwap DEX, which utilizes SMSG to enable its distributed order book and match orders between swap peers. Now, assume that SMSG gets hacked, spammed, or decrypted due to some unforeseen black swan event. Although such a circumstance could be a fatal blow to any dApp, it would be a minor setback for BasicSwap developers who could simply switch to an alternative, unaffected data layer. Moreover, in the case of BasicSwap, no user would lose funds, since atomic swaps are refunded when either of the two peers fails to act in a timely manner.</p><p>This is just one example of how other ideas, protocols, services, and ideas other projects are working on can unite under a commonly shared goal without competing with each other but without having to start developing together. We could sit here all night and just give an almost infinite number of examples, but I think you get the gist.</p><p>Because technology advances so fast, <strong>we must build solutions that will endure the test of time</strong>. By building agnostic solutions, we ALL become stronger, together, and we can promise lasting and resilient solutions to our users; the perfect embodiment of the open-source and cypherpunk ethos.</p><p>However, our agnostic approach is not solely confined to developer modules. After all, we all operate in the realm of cryptocurrencies, and many of us have unique communities that hold our coins and prefer to use them whenever possible.</p><p>In our previous example, we highlighted what would be a data layer module in which SMSG, Nym, XX Network, and other mixnets could theoretically power Particl dApps. But to be truly “open to all”, and to accomplish our mission of unifying the different blockchain projects working towards our shared goals of privacy and freedom, we have to go one step beyond that.</p><h2 id=\"currency-agnosticism\">Currency Agnosticism </h2><p>Currency agnosticism also offers us important bridging opportunities in privacy-first environments. Let us take the Particl Marketplace as an example: you can buy and sell anything online, privately and free of charge, and without third-parties. But there is, for people holding their liquidity in completely different coins, a caveat: you can currently only use the PART coin to do so. This introduces friction, and forces users to reach out to outside platforms in order to acquire this specific coin.</p><p>That is an important limiting factor to our overall vision, which is why we’re currently focused on building integration frameworks and payment modules for other coins to be accepted as payments, using an integrated, modular, back-end swap protocol, but still using PART as the final settlement layer.</p><p>While several quick fixes, such as centralized payment processors and exchanges, can be adopted, reverting to centralized parties inevitably leads to sub-optimal outcomes and jeopardizes the entire ecosystem, as evidenced by <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/saxdxk/dont_ever_use_changelly/\">the Changelly debacle</a> within the Monero community. To really fulfill our vision of a <strong>free, independent, fully resilient and privacy-first economy</strong> without central points of failure, every step has to be done in a decentralized and streamlined way.</p><h3 id=\"what-privacy-ramifications\">What Privacy Ramifications?</h3><p>While designing dApps to be currency-agnostic can provide new and thrilling possibilities for users from almost an infinite number of cryptocurrency projects, <strong>it also offers much more than just convenience</strong> or a 'preferred currency for payments.'</p><p>Let’s take Firo as an example. Firo (formerly known as Zcoin) is a cryptocurrency that stands out from the rest with its innovative privacy technology, Lelantus. This innovative feature allows users to make anonymous transactions differently: whereas $PART uses RingCT that obfuscates transactions using decoys, Firo’s Lelantus privacy technology allows users to burn their coins, and the user can redeem then at any time for brand new ones using zero-knowledge proofs to prove that he has the right to redeem them.</p><p>This is a creative and novel way to enhance privacy, and it has its pros and cons, depending on the purpose of a private transaction, risk tolerance, and costs. But one thing is sure, it becomes incredibly powerful when combined with other privacy setups.</p><p>Let us, for example's sake, assume that there is an item on the Particl Marketplace that you want to purchase. Settlement must be done in PART, which uses RingCT as its privacy layer. However, ideally, you may initiate the transaction using any currency.</p><p>Now, imagine that you initiate the transaction using a Firo Lelantus transaction. You specify this preference, and the Particl Marketplace provides you with a Firo address, provided by the BasicSwap DEX, to which you can send the coins to using Lelantus. The coins are then burned, and the FIRO redeem token is exchanged for anon PART using the BasicSwap DEX before being used to buy the item on the marketplace.</p><p>By this simple act, <strong>you’ve essentially used atomic swap technology to combine both Lelantus and RingCT in a single marketplace transaction</strong>, compounding both of their different and unique benefits with each other. This is only an example of what is possible by enabling and amplifying inter-compatibility in privacy tech.</p><h2 id=\"agnosticism-part-and-the-particl-marketplace\">Agnosticism, PART, and the Particl Marketplace</h2><p>Although the focus is on bridging privacy projects and privacy coins together in a truly open, highly accessible decentralized economic environment, the unique properties of the PART token means it will always remain the settlement layer for all Particl Marketplace transactions.  </p><p>There are also, of course, benefits associated with this form of agnosticism via the use of stablecoins, especially in the context of the Particl Marketplace, and perhaps even theoretical anonymous stablecoins in the future. It is clear that the possibilities introduced by truly decentralized agnostic payment systems are limitless.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">The Open-Source Revolution</h3><p>We're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital economy that is fair and open to all.

the open source BasicSwap DEX\nprotocol may have noticed some mentions of two different kinds of cross-chain\natomic swaps, namely “adaptor sig” swaps and “secret hash” swaps. \n\nThis article will explore the distinctions between the two kinds of swaps, their\ndifferences, and how the BasicSwap protocol leverages both to offer a truly\ndecentralized and remarkably private basis for decentralized exchanges.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat is an Atomic Swap?\nAn atomic swap, simply speaking, is a type of contract that enables a\ndecentralized cryptocurrency transaction. “Atomic”, in this case, implies that\nthe change of ownership of one asset should effectively imply the change of\nownership of the other. First conceptualized in 2013 by TierNolan on the\nBitcointalk forums\n[https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=193281.msg2003765#msg2003765], this\nfirst iteration of the concept, involving HTLCs (Hashed Time Lock Contracts),\nwould need four more years to finally see the light of day.\n\nAtomic swaps must involve two parties - as such, no third party or outside\nmiddleman can interrupt or interfere with the transaction. This characteristic\nmeans they are decentralized by nature and effectively immune to censorship, and\nas such are used in several decentralized exchanges, such as BasicSwap DEX and\nothers.\n\nIn the BasicSwap application, nearly all of the steps involved in both types of\nswaps happen seamlessly, at the back-end level. Furthermore, the initial\nagreement on the amounts and assets involved in any given swap between two\nparties is handled by its entirely distributed order book, powered by Particl's\nown encrypted mixnet, the SMSG network\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/].\n\nThe Original: Hashed Time Lock Contract (“Secret Hash”) Atomic Swaps\nThe first successful implementation of atomic swaps came from the Decred project\n[https://github.com/decred/atomicswap], leveraging \"hashlocks\" and \"timelocks\",\nwith the help of on-chain scripts (or smart contracts), to accomplish the atomic\nswap conceptualized by TierNolan years earlier. We refer to this type of swap as\na \"secret hash\" swap, or HTLC swap.\n\nTechnically speaking, the HTLC feature allows two users to conduct time-bound\ncryptocurrency transactions. This is highly relevant to this first\nimplementation of atomic swap technology, as the recipient must submit a\ncryptographic proof (the “secret”) to the contract within a set timeframe \n(established in number of blocks, or block height), or else the funds will be\nreturned to the sender. If the recipient acknowledges the payment, the\ntransaction is successful. This, as it happens, requires both participating\nblockchains to have both Hashlock and Timelock capabilities - a condition that\nleaves out certain blockchains, such as the notoriously rigid and hyper-private\nMonero blockchain.\n\nThese two key concepts may be summarized in the following way:\n\nA hashlock is a function of certain blockchains that restricts the spending of\nfunds until a certain piece of data is publicly disclosed (such as a\ncryptographic proof, in the form of a hash\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function]).\n\n\nA timelock is a function that restricts the spending of funds until a specific\ntime (or block height) in the future. This ensures that the transaction occurs\nwithin a given timeframe, and returns funds to the depositor if it is not\ncompleted, without a need for a third party adjudicator.\n\nThe graph below, sourced from Decred's implementation of atomic swaps, provides\na visual representation of the steps and necessary transfers of data that each\nparty performs:\n\n\n\nA HTLC (or \"secret hash\") atomic swap.\n\nIn other words, HTLC-based atomic swaps work as follows: \n\nAlice and Bob must first agree on the amounts and assets (e.g. Bitcoin and\nEther) to exchange. Alice then generates a random secret, s, and uses a\ncryptographic hash function to generate hash, h. She then creates an HTLC\ncontract using h, which locks up the Bitcoin. These coins can either be redeemed\n(spent) using the secret s, or they will be returned to her after a certain\namount of time, t, has passed. Bob does the same thing with his Ether on the\nother chain, locking it up in an HTLC using the same hash, h. Since Alice knows\nthe original secret, s, which was used to produce the hash, h, she can redeem\nthe Ether from Bob's HTLC. By doing so she reveals the secret s to Bob, who can\nthen take the Bitcoin and complete the swap.\n\nWithout diving too deep into the back-end inputs necessary to achieve a\nsuccessful HTLC swap as described in the graph above, the \"secret hash\" involved\nin them is the reason why HTLC swaps are sometimes referred to as \"Secret Hash\nswaps\". For the curious, more extensive documentation on the scripts involved in\nsecret hash swaps is available on the Decred atomic swap github page\n[https://github.com/decred/atomicswap].\n\nSome Shortcomings of Secret Hash Atomic Swaps\nAlthough they are a remarkable breakthrough in the space of decentralized \nexchange technologies, \"secret hash\" atomic swaps are not perfect: these atomic\nswap transactions, and thus, their associated data as well, take place on-chain,\nwhich has privacy implications that are particularly relevant to BasicSwap.\n\nWhenever a swap occurs, an identical hashed value will appear on both\nblockchains within a few blocks of each other — meaning that any moderately\nsophisticated passive observer of the two chains can easily link the coins\ninvolved in the swap, by finding identical hashes in blocks close to each other,\ntimestamp-wise. When the coins are tracked across chains, the provenance is\neasily established. Although there is no associated identity data revealed from\nsuch an analysis, it can potentially be trivial for third-parties to infer the\nidentity of the participants involved.\n\nThe Latest: Adaptor Signature (“Scriptless”) Atomic Swaps\nThe second type of atomic swap available on BasicSwap, dubbed \"adaptor sig\"\nswaps, is based on the work of Monero developer Joël \"h4sh3d\" Gugger, in a Sept.\n2020 paper titled \"Bitcoin–Monero Cross-chain Atomic Swap\"\n[https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126]. H4sh3d’s work can be said to be an\nimplementation of Lloyd Fournier’s work\n[https://github.com/LLFourn/one-time-VES/blob/master/main.pdf] on One-Time\nVerifiably Encrypted Signatures, A.K.A. Adaptor Signatures.\n\nThis type of swap is by necessity fundamentally different from HTLCs, because it\nis impossible for an XMR output to have an associated script. Therefore, a\ndifferent method, which relies in part on necessary prerequisites provided by\nthe non-XMR party, needs to be used to create the lock transaction. Note that\nthese prerequisites are such that the initiating party of the “adaptor sig” swap\nprotocol is only compatible with cryptocurrencies which use a bitcoin-style\ndecentralized UTXO model\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspent_transaction_output], and that have Segwit\nor a Segwit-equivalent malleability fix\n[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_malleability], such as Litecoin.\n\nThose \"scriptless\" swaps rely on a cryptographic technology known as an \"adaptor\nsignature\". In essence, without going too deep into the origins and underlying\nmath behind the technology, an adaptor signature is an additional signature that\nis combined with an initial signature to reveal a secret piece of data. Adaptor\nsignatures enable two parties to reveal two pieces of data to each other\nsimultaneously, and are the key building block of the kind of scriptless\nprotocols that render XMR atomic swap pairs possible.\n\nHow Does It Work?\nThis part of the article is particularly technical, but can shed some light on\nthe privacy distinctions between both swaps.\n\nThe graph below provides a visual representation of the steps and necessary\ntransfers of data that each party performs in an adaptor signature-based swap on\nBSX, from the offerer’s perspective. The green communication layer, in the case\nof BasicSwap, is handled by the SMSG network:\n\nAn \"adaptor sig\" atomic swap, from the Offerer's perspective.In other words,\nadaptor signature-based atomic swaps work as follows:\n\nAlice and Bob must first agree on the amounts and assets (e.g. BTC and XMR) to\nexchange. Just like in the case of “secret hash” swaps, this is achieved in a\nprivate and decentralized way in BasicSwap via its distributed order book.\n\nNote that a property of Monero is that the sum of public keys will match the\npublic key for the sum of private keys. By sending XMR to the sum of the public\nkeys they chose, Alice and Bob can create a lock tx similar to those used in the\nHLTC protocol.\n\nThe basic idea is:\n\nAlice and Bob each pick two secret (ECC) private keys (BTC and XMR), and swap\none set of public keys with each other. Here, three different keys are involved\nfor each side.\n\nAlice sends a BTC transaction with an output to a multisig output, which\nrequires a signature from both Alice and Bob in order to spend it. Once that\noccurs, Bob sees the BTC tx and sends the XMR tx to the XMR public key sum, as\nmentioned above.\n\nAlice signs for her private key and encumbers that signature with Bob's\nxmr_public_key.\n\nShe sends that adaptor signature to Bob. This adaptor signature is not a\ntransaction signature, so the transaction cannot be spent yet, but it does\ncommit to a secret value (Alice’s private key).\n\nBob then decodes the adaptor signature with his xmr_private key and then signs\nfor the BTC lock tx with his btc_private key.\n\nAs Bob now has a valid signature from Alice and himself, he can now spend from\nthe locked BTC tx.\n\nAlice watches the BTC chain for the tx that spends the lock tx. With Bob's\nsignature, which is broadcast publicly on the Bitcoin side once the Bitcoin\nlocked transaction is redeemed, she can recover Bob's xmr_private key.\n\nAlice, now endowed with both her and Bob's xmr_private keys, can spend from the\nXMR lock transaction, concluding the exchange.\n\n“****in’ VOILA” - Dr. Danny Duberstein accomplishing a BTC->XMR adaptor sig\natomic swap for the first time (allegedly)Some Advantages of Adaptor Signature\nSwaps\nAtomic swaps using adaptor signatures have several advantages over traditional\natomic swaps involving HTLCs.\n\nThe first thing to understand is that the adaptor signature swap scheme replaces\nthe on-chain scripts, involving timelocks and hashlocks, on which “secret hash”\nswaps rely on. In other words, the secret and secret-hash in a HTLC swap (as\ndetailed in the first graph) have no immediate parallel in adaptor sig swaps.\nThis particularity of adaptor signature technology is why their implementations\nare sometimes referred to as “scriptless scripts” within the Bitcoin research\ncommunity.\n\nSince no such script is involved, the on-chain footprint is reduced, which has\nthe non-negligible advantage of making the atomic swap more lightweight, and\ntherefore cheaper.\n\nFurthermore, contrary to HTLCs where the same hash has to be used on each chain,\ntransactions involved in an atomic swap using adaptor signatures cannot be\nlinked. This, again, is particularly relevant to BasicSwap’s privacy\nconsiderations [https://particl.news/privacy-and-liquidity-in-basicswap/],\ngranted that at least one of the two coins involved in the cross-chain swaps\nfulfills the prerequisites mentioned in the second paragraph of this article.\n\nThe Path Ahead for BSX: Two-Way Adaptor Signature Setup\nBecause scripts are not possible on blockchains like XMR, there are currently\nconstraints on which coin can initiate a swap on BSX. To trade Monero for\nBitcoin, for example, only the BTC-owning side can *initiate* a transaction. \n\nYet, because advance planning can be done consistent with atomic swapping, it is\nconceptually possible for both sides to effectively originate a swap:\n\nIf I have XMR and want, say, BTC, one could simply post a desire to do a trade \nas their offer. The BTC owner could then initiate the current, more formal\nprocess, still risk free. This process can be automated and be all but invisible\nto the front-end user experience, and is a major and very exciting upcoming item\non the BSX roadmap [https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap].\n\nTo Conclude…\nThe objective of this article is to provide a moderate but somewhat accessible\nunderstanding of why adaptor signature swaps can said to be a more private\nalternative to HTLC swaps, and how it protects swappers from any sort of\nmalicious passive observance by achieving the necessary smart contract logic for\nan atomic swap, without the use of on-chain script or hashed secrets. \n\nAs always, if you care about privacy as we do, we invite you to spread the word\nabout BasicSwap\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-dex/basicswap_explained.html]’s\nongoing open beta.

First conceptualized in 2013 by <a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=193281.msg2003765#msg2003765\">TierNolan on the Bitcointalk forums</a>, this first iteration of the concept, involving HTLCs (Hashed Time Lock Contracts), would need four more years to finally see the light of day.</p><p>Atomic swaps must involve two parties - as such, no third party or outside middleman can interrupt or interfere with the transaction. This characteristic means they are decentralized by nature and effectively immune to censorship, and as such are used in several decentralized exchanges, such as BasicSwap DEX and others.</p><p>In the BasicSwap application, nearly all of the steps involved in both types of swaps happen seamlessly, at the back-end level. Furthermore, the initial agreement on the amounts and assets involved in any given swap between two parties is handled by its entirely distributed order book, powered by Particl's own encrypted mixnet, the <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\">SMSG network</a>.</p><h2 id=\"the-original-hashed-time-lock-contract-secret-hash-atomic-swaps\">The Original: Hashed Time Lock Contract (“Secret Hash”) Atomic Swaps</h2><p>The first successful implementation of atomic swaps came <a href=\"https://github.com/decred/atomicswap\">from the Decred project</a>, leveraging \"hashlocks\" and \"timelocks\", with the help of on-chain scripts (or smart contracts), to accomplish the atomic swap conceptualized by TierNolan years earlier. We refer to this type of swap as a \"secret hash\" swap, or HTLC swap.</p><p>Technically speaking, the HTLC feature allows two users to conduct time-bound cryptocurrency transactions. This is highly relevant to this first implementation of atomic swap technology, as the recipient must submit a cryptographic proof (the “secret”) to the contract <strong>within a set timeframe</strong> (established in number of blocks, or block height), or else the funds will be returned to the sender. If the recipient acknowledges the payment, the transaction is successful. This, as it happens, requires both participating blockchains to have both <strong>Hashlock </strong>and <strong>Timelock </strong>capabilities - a condition that leaves out certain blockchains, such as the notoriously rigid and hyper-private Monero blockchain.</p><p>These two key concepts may be summarized in the following way:</p><p>A <strong>hashlock </strong>is a function of certain blockchains that restricts the spending of funds until a certain piece of data is publicly disclosed (such as a cryptographic proof, in the form of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function\">hash</a>).<br></p><p>A <strong>timelock </strong>is a function that restricts the spending of funds until a specific time (or block height) in the future. This ensures that the transaction occurs within a given timeframe, and returns funds to the depositor if it is not completed, without a need for a third party adjudicator.</p><p>The graph below, sourced from Decred's implementation of atomic swaps, provides a visual representation of the steps and necessary transfers of data that each party performs:</p><p></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2023/02/b8cfa1a1-d7ea-4f45-b79f-0609cff5889a.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2023/02/b8cfa1a1-d7ea-4f45-b79f-0609cff5889a.png 600w, /glink/2023/02/b8cfa1a1-d7ea-4f45-b79f-0609cff5889a.png 739w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>A HTLC (or \"secret hash\") atomic swap.</figcaption></figure><p></p><p>In other words, HTLC-based atomic swaps work as follows: </p><p>Alice and Bob must first agree on the amounts and assets (e.g. Bitcoin and Ether) to exchange. Alice then generates a random secret, s, and uses a cryptographic hash function to generate hash, <em>h</em>. She then creates an HTLC contract using <em>h</em>, which locks up the Bitcoin. These coins can either be redeemed (spent) using the secret <em>s</em>, or they will be returned to her after a certain amount of time, <em>t</em>, has passed. Bob does the same thing with his Ether on the other chain, locking it up in an HTLC using the same hash, <em>h</em>. Since Alice knows the original secret, <em>s</em>, which was used to produce the hash, <em>h</em>, she can redeem the Ether from Bob's HTLC. By doing so she reveals the secret <em>s</em> to Bob, who can then take the Bitcoin and complete the swap.</p><p>Without diving too deep into the back-end inputs necessary to achieve a successful HTLC swap as described in the graph above,<strong> the \"secret hash\" involved in them is the reason why HTLC swaps are sometimes referred to as \"Secret Hash swaps\"</strong>. For the curious, more extensive documentation on the scripts involved in secret hash swaps is available on the <a href=\"https://github.com/decred/atomicswap\">Decred atomic swap github page</a>.</p><h3 id=\"some-shortcomings-of-secret-hash-atomic-swaps\">Some Shortcomings of Secret Hash Atomic Swaps</h3><p>Although they are a remarkable breakthrough in the space of <strong>decentralized</strong> exchange technologies, \"secret hash\" atomic swaps are not perfect: these atomic swap transactions, and thus, their associated data as well, take place <strong>on-chain</strong>, which has privacy implications that are particularly relevant to BasicSwap.</p><p>Whenever a swap occurs, an identical hashed value will appear on both blockchains within a few blocks of each other — meaning that any moderately sophisticated passive observer of the two chains can easily link the coins involved in the swap, by finding identical hashes in blocks close to each other, timestamp-wise. When the coins are tracked across chains, the provenance is easily established. Although there is no associated identity data revealed from such an analysis, <strong>it can potentially be trivial for third-parties to infer the identity of the participants involved</strong>.</p><h2 id=\"the-latest-adaptor-signature-scriptless-atomic-swaps\">The Latest: Adaptor Signature (“Scriptless”) Atomic Swaps</h2><p>The second type of atomic swap available on BasicSwap, dubbed \"adaptor sig\" swaps, is based on the work of Monero developer Joël \"h4sh3d\" Gugger, in a Sept. 2020 paper titled <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126\">\"Bitcoin–Monero Cross-chain Atomic Swap\"</a>. H4sh3d’s work can be said to be an implementation of <a href=\"https://github.com/LLFourn/one-time-VES/blob/master/main.pdf\">Lloyd Fournier’s work</a> on One-Time Verifiably Encrypted Signatures, A.K.A. <strong>Adaptor Signatures</strong>.</p><p>This type of swap is by necessity fundamentally different from HTLCs, because it is impossible for an XMR output to have an associated script. Therefore, a different method, which relies in part on necessary prerequisites provided by the non-XMR party, needs to be used to create the lock transaction. Note that these prerequisites are such that the initiating party of the “adaptor sig” swap protocol is only compatible with cryptocurrencies which use a bitcoin-style decentralized <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspent_transaction_output\">UTXO model</a>, and that have Segwit or a Segwit-equivalent <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_malleability\">malleability fix</a>, such as Litecoin.</p><p>Those \"scriptless\" swaps rely on a cryptographic technology known as an \"adaptor signature\". In essence, without going too deep into the origins and underlying math behind the technology, an adaptor signature is an <strong>additional </strong>signature that is combined with an initial signature to reveal a secret piece of data. Adaptor signatures enable two parties to reveal <strong>two pieces of data</strong> to each other simultaneously, and are the key building block of the kind of scriptless protocols that render XMR atomic swap pairs possible.</p><h3 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How Does It Work?</h3><p>This part of the article is particularly technical, but can shed some light on the privacy distinctions between both swaps.</p><p>The graph below provides a visual representation of the steps and necessary transfers of data that each party performs in an adaptor signature-based swap on BSX, from the offerer’s perspective. The green communication layer, in the case of BasicSwap, is handled by the SMSG network:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-container\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-row\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"/glink/2023/02/dabb556d-c1d9-452b-b077-9e7b8de69c04.png\" width=\"935\" height=\"1405\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2023/02/dabb556d-c1d9-452b-b077-9e7b8de69c04.png 600w, /glink/2023/02/dabb556d-c1d9-452b-b077-9e7b8de69c04.png 935w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></div></div></div><figcaption>An \"adaptor sig\" atomic swap, from the Offerer's perspective.</figcaption></figure><p>In other words, adaptor signature-based atomic swaps work as follows:</p><p>Alice and Bob must first agree on the amounts and assets (e.g. BTC and XMR) to exchange. Just like in the case of “secret hash” swaps, this is achieved in a private and decentralized way in BasicSwap via its distributed order book.</p><p>Note that a property of Monero is that <strong>the sum of public keys will match the public key for the sum of private keys</strong>. By sending XMR to the sum of the public keys they chose, Alice and Bob can create a lock tx similar to those used in the HLTC protocol.</p><p><strong>The basic idea is:</strong></p><p>Alice and Bob each pick <strong>two secret (ECC) private keys</strong> (BTC and XMR), and swap one set of public keys with each other. Here, three different keys are involved for each side.</p><p>Alice sends a BTC transaction with an output to a multisig output, which requires a signature from both Alice and Bob in order to spend it. Once that occurs, Bob sees the BTC tx and sends the XMR tx to the XMR <strong>public key sum</strong>, as mentioned above.</p><p>Alice signs for her private key and encumbers that signature with Bob's xmr_public_key.</p><p>She sends that <strong>adaptor signature</strong> to Bob. This adaptor signature is not a transaction signature, so the transaction cannot be spent yet, but it does commit to a secret value (Alice’s private key).</p><p>Bob then decodes the adaptor signature with his xmr_private key and then signs for the BTC lock tx with his btc_private key.</p><p>As Bob now has a valid signature from Alice and himself, he can now spend from the locked BTC tx.</p><p>Alice watches the BTC chain for the tx that spends the lock tx.

Following this new landscape, as the night to day, came the\ninterest of regulators and government bodies.

Although they apply on most cryptocurrency trading\nplatforms to even the smallest traders, their main goal involves preventing tax\nfraud and money laundering at large scales. As such, they are, at their core, a\ntool by and for government entities, and they introduce, for all, users security\ncontingencies that are often ignored.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Grip of KYC on Closed Source Software\nRegulatory authorities take this assignment very seriously: nearly every\ncentralized exchange or financial platform (Paypal, Venmo, Binance, FTX, etc.)\n is exposed to this customer due diligence, which of course, routinely\ndiscriminates on the basis of geographical location or even nationality. \n\nOn the other hand, the tools available to regulatory entities, when it comes to\nregulating decentralized organizations and protocols, are a lot harder to come\nby and can involve extremely rare and difficult-to-enforce provisions. This is\nespecially true when cryptography is heavily involved - those methods, after\nall, would be limited to governments' capacity to identify and prosecute often\nhidden users.\n\nA nuclear option, as we’ve briefly explored in a previous piece\n[https://particl.news/the-radical-sovereignty-of-open-source-distributed-governance/]\n, can be seen in the U.S. Department of the Treasury's blacklisting of Tornado\nCash, a decentralized “bitcoin mixer” service used by some for asset laundering. \n\nThe KYC to Identity Theft Pipeline\nIdentifying data on users of financial applications and websites is, of course,\nextremely valuable for hackers; they are, by their nature, an almost-guaranteed\nprofitable hacking target. After all, these people have digital money that can\nbe hacked or physically extorted, and it is likely that they are somewhat big\ninternet users — meaning lots of accounts and data to steal.\n\nWhat makes things worse is that it seems that, nowadays, regulations are\ntightening to such an extent that as soon as one wishes to exchange, buy, or\nsell assets or cryptocurrencies, they have to reveal their entire identity.\nThese unfortunate but enforced KYC requirements directly led to the 2019 leak\n[https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/07/binance-customer-data-has-leaked-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont/] \nof the Binance cryptocurrency exchange user’s information, as well as the more\nrecent MobiKwik financial information data leak in India - dubbed the “largest\nKYC data leak in history\n[https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/mobikwik-data-breach-said-to-be-largest-kyc-leak-personal-data-of-3-5-million-users-up-for-sale-on-dark-web-1784957-2021-03-30]\n”. These KYC data leaks can involve passwords, pictures, physical addresses,\nfinancial information, e-mail addresses, and full names: everything\nill-intentioned actors would need to target unsuspecting user’s accounts and\nassets.\n\nThe proliferation of those requirements will, without a doubt, lead to newer,\neven more severe security breaches — and there really is not much we can do\nabout it if we're so bent on using centralized services that are compelled into\nestablishing those KYC requirements. And sometimes, to fix serious and\npersistent problems, you need to think radically outside the box.\n\nA Future of Open Source Alternatives\nThere are solutions and services developed that aim to radically address, in\ncompliance with current regulations, this seemingly inescapable, ever-present\nreality, notably in the world of currency exchange.\n\nSome of those services, such as the Bisq\n[https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/bisq-review/]\ndecentralized currency exchange platform and protocol, live up to their promises\nof distributed resistance and uncompromising anonymity — but come with serious\ndrawbacks in terms of ease of use and accessibility.\n\nThat is why we've built, with BasicSwap\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/], a fully\ndecentralized, open source, private, self-custodial, and cross-chain\ndecentralized trading exchange, powered by atomic swaps\n[https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/08/20/a-beginners-guide-to-atomic-swaps/],\nand with an eye for simplicity.

with the creation of the \"first altcoin\", Litecoin, people have been\npondering and developing ways to swap their favorite digital assets without\nrelying on third-parties — the goal being an efficient, simple and private way\nto swap Bitcoin for Litecoin, or Monero, or any other cryptocurrency, that holds\nthe same values as a traditional P2P cryptocurrency transaction. The immediate\nproblem is that these cryptocurrencies generally reside on separate blockchains,\nwhich do not offer a lot of interoperability.\n\nDevelopers and tech entrepreneurs of all kinds have spotted this need in the\nmarket and went to work trying to bring to life a series of decentralized\ntrading exchanges — often abbreviated as \"DEX\".  This led to an increase in the\nnumber of DEXs and decentralized trading protocols which, in truth, really have\nlarge degrees of variation between them in terms of decentralization or even\nstraight up usability.\n\nOne thing that can be observed is that, even today with dozens upon dozens of\nDEXs, a substantial quantity of them focus exclusively on intra-chain swaps,\nmeaning swapping different assets belonging to the same chain together. Those\nare unfortunately very restricted in their swapping abilities, and do not fix\nthe underlying issues regarding important but perhaps more difficult to\nintegrate blockchains like Monero.\n\nCrossing the Chain Barrier\nTo many users, the details of how such cross-chain trades are accomplished under\nthe hood is not very much on their mind — and the distinction may even seem\nfutile. The rebuttal is obvious; “But what about X and Y exchanges that claim to\nbe able to make cross-chain swaps? After all, I can swap BTC for CAKE on the\nBinance Smart Chain!\" Unfortunately, in nearly all cases, the interoperability\noffered by cross-chain DEXs does not function in a way that is optimal to those\nusers’ interests. And that's especially true for those who need additional\nprivacy protections for their asset swaps, or simply those who are serious about\ndecentralization and privacy.\n\nThere is a sad pattern we can often observe with lots of \"new-wave\" DEXs: many\nbold but ultimately lacking claims of interoperability without third parties are\nput forward. The way many of these DEXs achieve cross-chain compatibility is\ngenerally by adopting an illusory strategy which really ends up being a travesty\nboth in terms of decentralization and of security.\n\nA common strategy attempted to achieve that promise is the \"wrapping\", or\n\"mirroring\", of assets. With this strategy, the process of swapping can indeed\nbe decentralized, but what you are ultimately left with is a wrapped asset on\nthe very same chain you've initiated the swap from. A wrapped asset is a token\non a smart-contract chain that is allegedly backed by the asset it claims to be\nmirroring.\n\nThe original asset is held, in custody, by a third-party which then issues a\ntoken worth exactly that asset (an IOU). The smart contract holds the custodian\nto its promise that it will pay you back the original asset once you redeem it\nin exchange for the wrapped asset. But as we well know, \"not your keys, not your\ncoins”.\n\nUnfortunately, if the custodian loses access to your coins (which has happened\nin the past\n[https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/stakehound-loses-private-keys/]) there is\nabsolutely no recourse. The custodian is even in a position to possibly reverse\nor freeze your transactions\n[https://cryptocurrencynewsroom.com/tether-can-reverse-and-control-your-usdt/] \nthemselves, or lock you out from accessing your hard-earned assets\n[https://fortune.com/2022/03/07/coinbase-blocks-25000-crypto-wallets-russians-sanctions/]\n. The possibility of this, we can all agree, is straying very far from anything\ndecentralized and the original ethos of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnother common strategy involves atomic swaps – this, however, comes with\nimportant challenges when dealing certain pairs or highly different blockchains,\nor with particularly rigid blockchains such as Monero.\n\nThe Challenges of Atomic Swaps and DEXs\nAtomic swaps have been around for quite some time, having been first proposed\nin\n2013\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/lukefitzpatrick/2019/09/02/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-atomic-swaps/?sh=50fc82761784]\n. They allow two parties who don't know each other to safely swap\ncryptocurrencies without the use of a third-party. The process is time and\ncondition based — hence “atomic” — and any failure to remain honest or forgo\none's end of the deal automatically results in the assets being refunded to\ntheir original owner. It is, by design, impossible to cheat someone when doing\natomic swaps.\n\nBut even with atomic swaps, true, uncompromised decentralization is very hard to\nachieve when you want to swap one cryptocurrency to another one from an entirely\ndifferent chain. Notably, attempting to interact with highly privacy-centric\ncoins such as Monero, which has a famously rigid but incredibly private\nblockchain structure, leaves us with very few user-friendly and decentralized\nalternatives: often requiring users to run a Monero node, a Bitcoin node, both,\nor deal with highly complicated experimental protocols lacking in even basic\nGUI.\n\nAtomic swaps on their own are not enough for our purposes. In order to acquire\ntrue cross-chain operability on a bona fide exchange, and without giving in an\ninch on decentralization and privacy, atomic swaps require a secondary network,\nor layer, to coordinate some level of information between chains. That is\nprecisely where a huge challenge lies, and why atomic swaps have not been widely\navailable between two chains (especially involving Monero) as of yet.\n\nThat’s in major part what motivated us to build BasicSwap\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/] — a \ncross-chain, truly decentralized, and privacy-first DEX. When you trade, say,\nBitcoin to Monero on the BasicSwap orderbook, no extensive node configuration is\nneeded, and absolutely no wrapping of assets takes place. We instead made true\ncross-chain swaps possible by combining two groundbreaking protocols; atomic\nswaps, and Particl’s own SMSG mixnet network\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/].\n\nBasicSwap — The Fully Private Cross-Chain DEXMatch and settle cryptocurrency\ntrades in a trustless setup without any central point of failure or fee.Particl\nNewscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/]SMSG: A layer\n2 Solution for Cross-Chain Interoperability\nBitcoin advocates often mention the role of cross-chain operability will be\nfilled by the Lightning Network. Years have passed and, although we are seeing\nnominal progress on that end, it is unfortunately very slow and still\ncomplicated to setup. But because the ability to swap cryptocurrencies with full\nprivacy is of dire need in this day and age, we’ve decided to take control of\nthings and build exactly a solution for that: BasicSwap.\n\nSecureMessaging (SMSG)\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/glossary.html#term-SecureMessaging-SMSG],\na P2P messaging network inspired by BitMessage and developed by the particl.io\nteam, is what powers the BasicSwap DEX in place of the Lightning Network.\n\nIt acts as the required messaging layer for the accomplishment of BasicSwap’s\ntruly decentralized cross-chain DEX. SMSG is a simple message mixnet, where all\nnodes store a copy of everyone's end-to-end encrypted messages for a limited\nperiod of time. The sender of a message cannot exactly pinpoint the IP address\nof the receiver, because the messages defuse over the entire network.\n\nAll nodes attempt to decrypt every incoming message - if the HMAC\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC]check fails, then the message was either\nfraudulent or not addressed for you. This technology allowed us to successfully\nbuild a powerful and truly cross-chain DEX, that works using atomic swaps and \n'scriptless scripts'\n[https://wiki.ion.radar.tech/tech/research/scriptless-scripts-schnorr].\n\nThis allows BasicSwap to relay vital atomic swap information from one chain to\nan entirely different one, even Monero, in a seamless and user-friendly manner\nand without coin wrapping, custodian entity, or any other centralized\nenvironment. This layer 2 acts as a powerful, entirely distributed bridge\nbetween chains that otherwise have nothing in common — an uncompromisingly\ndistributed alternative with incredible potential for easy-to-use third-party\nintegrations and contributions.\n\nTo learn more about BasicSwap, refer to this in-depth blog post\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/] or have a\nlook at its section on the Particl Academy\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-dex/basicswap_explained.html]!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo here we stand today - trying to move the ball forward, always, towards a new\nera of decentralized cryptocurrency trading. An era where centralized,\ninstitutionalized, corporate “exchanges\" and the substantial security\nliabilities they involve are simply not needed anymore. An era where everyone is\nfree to trade whatever asset they want, efficiently and without third-parties.\n\nIf you want to help us build a freer world and more sane cryptocurrency trading\nconditions for all, we invite you to come test BasicSwap’s open beta, which goes\nlive imminently, and send us your feedback.

The immediate problem is that these cryptocurrencies generally reside on separate blockchains, which do not offer a lot of interoperability.</p><p>Developers and tech entrepreneurs of all kinds have spotted this need in the market and went to work trying to bring to life a series of decentralized trading exchanges — often abbreviated as \"DEX\".  This led to an increase in the number of DEXs and decentralized trading protocols which, in truth, really have large degrees of variation between them in terms of decentralization or even straight up usability.</p><p>One thing that can be observed is that, even today with dozens upon dozens of DEXs, a substantial quantity of them focus exclusively on intra-chain swaps, meaning swapping different assets belonging to the same chain together. Those are unfortunately very restricted in their swapping abilities, and do not fix the underlying issues regarding important but perhaps more difficult to integrate blockchains like Monero.</p><h2 id=\"crossing-the-chain-barrier\">Crossing the Chain Barrier</h2><p>To many users, the details of how such cross-chain trades are accomplished under the hood is not very much on their mind — and the distinction may even seem futile. The rebuttal is obvious; “But what about X and Y exchanges that claim to be able to make cross-chain swaps? After all, I can swap BTC for CAKE on the Binance Smart Chain!\" Unfortunately, in nearly all cases, the interoperability offered by cross-chain DEXs does not function in a way that is optimal to those users’ interests. And that's especially true for those who need additional privacy protections for their asset swaps, or simply those who are serious about decentralization and privacy.</p><p>There is a sad pattern we can often observe with lots of \"new-wave\" DEXs: many bold but ultimately lacking claims of interoperability without third parties are put forward. The way many of these DEXs achieve cross-chain compatibility is generally by adopting an illusory strategy which really ends up being a travesty both in terms of decentralization and of security.</p><p>A common strategy attempted to achieve that promise is the \"wrapping\", or \"mirroring\", of assets. With this strategy, the process of swapping can indeed be decentralized, but what you are ultimately left with is a <strong>wrapped asset</strong> on the very same chain you've initiated the swap from. A <strong>wrapped asset</strong> is a token on a smart-contract chain that is allegedly backed by the asset it claims to be mirroring.</p><p>The original asset is held, <strong>in custody</strong>, by a third-party which then issues a token worth exactly that asset (an IOU). The smart contract holds the custodian to its promise that it will pay you back the original asset once you redeem it in exchange for the wrapped asset. But as we well know, \"not your keys, not your coins”.</p><p>Unfortunately, if the custodian loses access to your coins (<a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/stakehound-loses-private-keys/\">which has happened in the past</a>) there is absolutely no recourse. The custodian is even in a position to possibly<a href=\"https://cryptocurrencynewsroom.com/tether-can-reverse-and-control-your-usdt/\"> reverse or freeze your transactions</a> themselves, or<a href=\"https://fortune.com/2022/03/07/coinbase-blocks-25000-crypto-wallets-russians-sanctions/\"> lock you out from accessing your hard-earned assets</a>. The possibility of this, we can all agree, is straying very far from anything decentralized and the original ethos of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Another common strategy involves atomic swaps – this, however, comes with important challenges when dealing certain pairs or highly different blockchains, or with particularly rigid blockchains such as Monero.</p><h2 id=\"the-challenges-of-atomic-swaps-and-dexs\">The Challenges of Atomic Swaps and DEXs</h2><p>Atomic swaps have been around for quite some time, having been <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/lukefitzpatrick/2019/09/02/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-atomic-swaps/?sh=50fc82761784\">first proposed in 2013</a>. They allow two parties who don't know each other to safely swap cryptocurrencies without the use of a third-party. The process is time and condition based — hence “atomic” — and any failure to remain honest or forgo one's end of the deal automatically results in the assets being refunded to their original owner. It is, by design, impossible to cheat someone when doing atomic swaps.</p><p>But even with atomic swaps, true, uncompromised decentralization is very hard to achieve when you want to swap one cryptocurrency to another one from an entirely different chain. Notably, attempting to interact with highly privacy-centric coins such as Monero, which has a famously rigid but incredibly private blockchain structure, leaves us with very few user-friendly <em>and</em> decentralized alternatives: often requiring users to run a Monero node, a Bitcoin node, both, or deal with highly complicated experimental protocols lacking in even basic GUI.</p><p>Atomic swaps on their own are not enough for our purposes. In order to acquire true cross-chain operability on a <em>bona fide</em> exchange, and without giving in an inch on decentralization and privacy, atomic swaps require a secondary network, or layer, to coordinate some level of information between chains. That is precisely where a huge challenge lies, and why atomic swaps have not been widely available between two chains (especially involving Monero) as of yet.</p><p>That’s in major part what motivated us to build <a href=\"https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/\">BasicSwap</a> — a <strong>cross-chain, truly decentralized, and privacy-first DEX</strong>.

and political organization -\nspecifically, about how blockchain-centric and privacy-centric organizations and\nprojects ought to be structured. \n\nWhile there are no one-size-fits-all answers, the powerful shakeup blockchain\ntechnologies brought to the internet means a lot more room for novel ideas of\norganization in this sphere. The advent of distributed autonomous organizations\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization] is a prime\nexample; while still in their early stages, DAOs lay the groundwork for\npolitical systems that are more compatible than ever with open-source products\nand services - especially truly disruptive, dissident applications of these new\ntechnologies.\n\nA decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), as we know, is a community made\nup of a multitude of participants, which functions according to the rules of\ngovernance inscribed in smart contracts as well as a democratic process of\nengagement. Management of those organizations is decentralized and democratic:\ndecisions that need to be made are made by stakeholders via an auditable,\ndistributed public vote. That is the case, for example, with the Particl\nprivacy-centric protocol, which concluded its latest development funding vote\nthis week [https://particl.news/team-funding-request-3-results/].\n\nSovereignty and Disruptive Technology\nPolitical thinker Carl Schmitt is well known for his articulation of the\n“Ausnahmezustand”, or “state of exception”, as well as its varied political\nimplications.\n\nSometimes defined as an emergency provision allowing a given government to\nsuspend the rule of law (such as martial law, or the french état de siège),\nSchmitt’s theory of Ausnahmezustand actually cuts deeper: at a deeper level,\nwhoever decides on this state of exception, or is in a position to deem it to\nexist and to remedy to it, can ultimately be defined as the “true sovereign\".\nAll other structures of power involved - whether it be a state government, a\nsupranational entity, or the governance of an organization such as Tornado Cash\n- ultimately fall under the remit of this “true sovereignty”. This has powerful,\nbroad implications; particularly on communities and projects that threaten the\ninterests, or even the existence, of genuinely sovereign power structures.\n\nOf course, a truly disruptive technology or service isn’t abstractly disruptive:\nit is disruptive with respect to a concrete power structure – oftentimes state\npower, endowed with powerful means to preserve its integrity. Such was the case\nwith the recent Tornado Cash debacle\n[https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/08/crypto-mixing-service-tornado-cash-blacklisted-by-us-treasury/]\n, a crypto mixer that became so disruptive to American national interests as to\nforce the U.S. Treasury Department to flex some of its most powerful tools to\nnearly instantly crush it out of existence. One of its main developers, Alexey\nPertsev, was arrested, jailed, and even denied bail\n[https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/24/alleged-tornado-developer-pertsev-must-stay-in-jail-dutch-judge-rules/] \nin the Netherlands, thousands of miles away from the White House. While it may\nbe too late for Tornado Cash to ever come back from this blow, several lessons\ncan be learned from this.\n\nMoving Forward: Divide AND Rule\nWhat can we learn of such a conditional governance, a governance that functions\nbecause it is allowed to? Ausnahmezustand, we can see, invokes a powerful\nparadox - but even Schmitt could not possibly have predicted the political\nrealities that offer themselves to us today.\n\nWhile still in their infancy, encrypted and truly distributed blockchain-era\ntechnologies — and the political structures they make possible — reveal\nthemselves as powerful alternatives to traditional governance. This is\nespecially true for organizations that threaten the power structures at work\nwithin the political spheres they are bound to; examples include dissident media\nentities, gray marketplace environments, currency exchange platforms, or even\nfile sharing platforms and protocols. For those rebels, distributed and\nanonymous decision making, file hosting and communications become shielded from\nthe potentially dire consequences of their resistance.\n\nWithout the unique aspects of DAOs - specifically its distributed nature, its\nprivate and pseudonymous aspects, and its utmost resistance to censorship - this\n“true sovereign” of any truly disruptive product or organization must by\ndefinition be unaccountable. This is because they either must be cloaked in\ntotal obscurity, being obligated to expertly hide themselves from power in order\nto subsist, or ultimately fall prey to the interests of higher powers.\nDistributed sovereignty, in this context, flips the old adage: divide AND rule,\nbut on the terms of the many instead of the few.\n\nDistributed Rule: A Future of Possibilities\nPrinciples of liberty, free access to information, freedom of association, and\nopen source technologies come together in such a radically distributed system of\ngovernance. With a lot of room to grow, decentralized autonomous organizational\nstructures have enormous potential to radically redefine the structuring of\neconomic activities and, at the same time, major economic, financial, and even\nlegal issues — the exploration of which has only just begun.\n\n\n\nIf you want to learn more about the revolutionary decentralized ecosystem we're\nbuilding at Particl, and if you want to contribute to the growth of online\nprivacy and liberties, then come join our awesome global community of\ncypherpunks on Discord [https://discord.me/particl], Telegram\n[https://t.me/particlOn], or Element\n[https://matrix.to/#/%23particl-project:matrix.org] — or just give one of our\ndecentralized and privacy-first apps a try here [https://particl.io/].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJoin the discussion\nWhat's your stance?

This is the case for its Particl Marketplace, which allows anyone\nin the world to buy and sell goods and services, physical or digital, in total\nprivacy.\n\n The marketplace dApp uses a mix of P2P and blockchain technologies, meaning\nthat it is run in an entirely distributed way from start to finish — no\nthird-party or intermediary ever has any sort of centralized role or control\nover its network. \n\nThis, by design, ensures the highest levels of privacy and security for the\nnetwork as a whole and is radically resistant to censorship. Particl\nMarketplace’s unique and sophisticated escrow system abides by these same\nprinciples, presenting many users with substantial benefits.\n\nThe Need for an Escrow model\nA staple of online market environments is the presence of an escrow system: when\ntrading with strangers, users need to be confident that the other party will\nkeep their end of the agreement and act in good faith throughout. That is why\ncontract security and enforcement are essential when trading goods and services\nin any marketplace.\n\n\nOne common solution eCommerce platforms and payment processors use is a\nmutually-trusted third party — in other words, an escrow agent or “issue\nresolution center”. In the context of a decentralized marketplace, this incurs a\ncritical problem: the introduction of a centralized moderating entity. It also\nattracts its own privacy issues as well as some economic drawbacks. Let’s\nexplore what this means for Particl Marketplace.\n\nCommon Issues With Traditional Escrow Models\nWith traditional escrow, a third-party (the escrow agent) holds onto an asset\nand releases it when the transaction is completed (i.e., the purchased item is\ndelivered). That role is generally assumed by the marketplace or exchange itself\n(i.e., Amazon, Openbazaar), a payment processor (i.e., Paypal, Visa), or\nthird-party escrow services (i.e., a bank or a financial institution). This\nallows potential disputes or issues to be safely settled, but it also carries\nimportant issues.\n\nFirstly, running escrow or issue resolution services incurs a heavy cost\nreflected in the platform's fees. When added to every link of a supply chain,\nthis fee ends up substantially impacting retail prices and making up a large\nportion of the final price of nearly all products we buy daily.\n\nAdditionally, when an issue arises, it is usually settled according to a very\nrigid set of policies rather than being dealt with on a case-by-case basis. This\nallows for more issues to be resolved quickly and efficiently but can also lead\nto biased resolutions that benefit the operator's own bottom line. In turn,\nscammers have perfected the art of defeating these hard-set policies to steal\nmoney, products, or both, from rule-abiding users and sellers. Online merchants\nare well aware of this problem and hedge their exposure to this risk through\ntheir prices, an unfortunate reality that the customer is ultimately led to bear\nthe costs.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, these solutions offer no privacy at all\nto their users and incur intrusive data requirements due to the operator needing\nto be aware of every detail related to a single transaction to fulfill its role.\nThis gives them complete oversight and insight over all the sensitive and, at\ntimes, confidential, personal, professional, financial, and commercial data\ncollected from the platform's users — which they, in turn, can use in accordance\nwith their interests, often to the detriment of the individuals and businesses\nusing the platform\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/].\n\nParticl’s Two-Party Online Escrow Solution\nParticl adopts a radically different escrow model which addresses the issues\nmentioned above. Often dubbed a “two-party escrow\", or \"MAD escrow\", it involves\nonly two parties; the buyer and the seller, with no one else in between.\n\nInstead of requiring a third party to hold the payment on behalf of two\ntransacting parties, both participants are required to provide collateral by\nmaking an equal security deposit into a smart-contract. This security deposit\ncan be adjusted from 0 to 100% of the total value of the item or service sold\nand is automatically refunded, in its entirety, once both parties mark the\ntransaction as completed. Notably, this form of decentralized escrow is\ninfinitely scalable, as there are no operating costs associated with running\nthese types of cryptographically-enforced contracts and no escrow agents\nrequired for it to function.\n\nIf a dispute or issue arises, both parties need to mutually agree on a\nsatisfying resolution for the transaction to be marked as complete. Because the\ntwo parties have a security deposit locked into the escrow smart-contract, they\nare naturally forced to collaborate and reach a reasonable resolution for both. \nThis method of escrow allows the Particl marketplace to preserve the privacy of\neveryone involved in every instance.\n\nAnother important but often overlooked advantage of two-party escrows involves\nsellers and cash flow. Although 2-of-2 escrow demands a security deposit, which\nmay, on first thought, appear as a cash flow-inhibiting process, it is\ncompletely shielded from assets being frozen by entities like Amazon or Paypal\n[https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/01/paypal-stole-users-money-after-freezing-seizing-funds-lawsuit-alleges/] \nin the event of a dispute or perceived terms of use violations. Unfortunately,\nthis is an extremely common reality for providers of services and goods on those\nplatforms and can cause assets to remain in limbo for up to 6 months or even\npermanently\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/NootropicsDepot/comments/jyeeyh/will_there_ever_be_a_paypal_option_to_pay/]\n. For many sellers, such a risk could prove fatal to their business\n[https://realbusiness.co.uk/paypal-is-becoming-toxic-to-small-business].\n\nMutually Assured Destruction Game Theory\nBy definition, game theory simply refers to the study of mathematical models of\nstrategic interaction among rational decision-makers\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory]. In other words, it incentivizes\nrational decision-making and simultaneously disincentivizes irrational/dishonest\nbehavior.\n\nTo accomplish that desired outcome within the context of a two-party escrow\nsystem, Particl leverages the Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) game theory in\na financial context. “MAD” is a military doctrine “based on the theory of\ndeterrence, which stipulates that the threat of using strong weapons against the\nenemy prevents the enemy’s use of those same weapons. The strategy is a form of\nNash equilibrium in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to\ninitiate a conflict or to disarm” (Wikipedia\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction]).\n\nBy combining Particl’s implementation of BIP 65\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki] , which allows\na transaction output to be made unspendable until some point in the future, with\nthe advanced trustless data transmission capabilities of the SMSG network\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/], the\nmarketplace’s two-party escrow system locks funds in a secure multi-signature\nsmart-contract until all parties sign off on the transaction. This also\nencourages communication and negotiation between buyers and sellers if a\ntransaction goes wrong.\n\nThe result: Enabling Total Privacy in the Business World\nOne of Particl’s two-party escrow’s unique functionality resides in how it keeps\nall aspects of every transaction private-by-default. When you protect a\nmarketplace trade with the escrow system, you ensure that all data and\ninformation related to the transaction and its participants remain anonymous to\noutside observers. This is made possible by the complete absence of\nthird-parties involved, as well as the escrow’s smart contract itself being\nbuilt with some of the latest privacy technologies to guarantee anonymity down\nto the protocol level.\n\nIndeed, as we’ve mentioned above, Particl’s two-party escrow system leverages a\ncombination of its unique SMSG network as well as the BIP 65 proposal\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki] originally\nimplemented on Bitcoin. But that in itself is not enough to offer a satisfactory\nlevel of privacy; it merely allows trustless escrow transactions to take place.\n\nTo provide the escrow contract with the required privacy, payments and security\ndeposits are sent as “Confidential Transactions\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_part_coin.html#blind-transactions]\n”, a transaction type that hides the transferred amounts. To hide the identity\nof the participants as well, a RingCT transaction\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_part_coin.html#anon-transactions] \nis then directly chained into the initial Confidential Transaction’s outputs,\nultimately hiding all information about both the transacted amounts and\nparticipants to anyone not involved with the transaction. This offers the\nhighest level of transactional privacy possible, one not remotely possible with\ntraditional escrow models such as those we see on the most popular online\nmarketplaces and payment processors.\n\nNotably, this form of anonymous escrow smart-contract is an impressive feat\nconsidering that RingCT transactions are very rigid and not even supposed to be\nable to interact with smart-contracts. You can learn more about the creative\nmethods the Particl team used to make that possible here\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd#ct-ringct-together-infinite-possibilities]\n.\n\nTwo-Party Escrow Contracts; Making Possible a Myriad of Use-Cases\nTwo-party escrow contracts open up a ton of use-cases and advantages unique to\nits model. Some of them are due to its commitment to trustless privacy, the\nabsence of commissions or escrow fees, or the MAD system’s inherent resistance\nto abuse.\n\nWhile all those advantages stand on their own, they particularly shine in the\ncontexts of:\n\nProviding unstoppable, uncensorable eCommerce gateways for otherwise censored\nindividuals or blocked regions.\n\nThere are many cases of individuals running online stores getting censored or\nshut down by their provider — be it a payment processor, hosting provider, or\neCommerce platform operator. The same can be said of people living in specific\nregions of the world that are banned from traditional financial services or\nsimply unbanked.\n\nBecause even settlements on Particl can be achieved purely peer-to-peer, such\nindividuals now have the new-found option of easily opening up a storefront and\nengaging in restriction-less commerce without the possibility for an escrow\nservice to weigh in, intervene on, or run interference in the process.\n\nIn other words, a trustless, private, and truly person-to-person escrow model,\nespecially when supported by an equally open and free marketplace environment\n[https://particl.io/marketplace], creates a global free market environment where\neveryone, regardless of who they are and where they live, gets to do business on\na fair, level playing field.\n\nProtection of intellectual property\n\nIn a powerful, reliable escrow system without third-party involvement, users are\nassured that it is impossible for their marketplace service provider (in this\ncase, Particl Marketplace [https://particl.io/marketplace]) to spy on them or\ncollect valuable data information.\n\nThis is a reassuring news for sellers, and especially product inventors, as\nsalvaged data from centralized escrow system providers is usually sold (often\ndirectly to competitors) and re-used by the platform operator itself; a practice\nthat goes directly against a seller’s best interest and, at times, frustratingly\nleads to the total destruction of one’s business as we’ve explored in this \nParticl Story [https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/].\n\nProviding additional means for wholesalers and goods manufacturers to\nsell/dispose of excess stock\n\nWhen wholesalers reach a point of critical excess inventory, they need to get\nrid of excess inventory at a minimal cost. Unfortunately, this makes using\ntraditional marketplace environments problematic due to its many layers of\nthird-party involvement and associated costs.\n\nWith Particl Marketplace, they can do so with no additional sales costs thanks\nto Particl’s marketplace protocol zero-commission approach and the absence of\nmiddlemen involved. This is a scenario where both the wholesaler and the\nconsumer get more out of their assets, ultimately reducing the total volume of\nwaste/discarded products.\n\nMore direct, more liquid, and more secure B2B and B2C trades.\n\nThis is made possible by Particl Marketplace’s zero fees and zero data\ncollection approach, which is unmatched in any other system (even in\ncustom-built systems, the central entity running this system, such as a central\nserver or database, can always collect some amount of data.)\n\nAvoiding scams when making in-person or high-value transactions\n\nParticl Marketplace and its two-party escrow system can be used to secure\nin-person transactions when an added layer of security is wanted or required,\nsuch as when two strangers physically meet to trade together.\n\nThe two-party escrow system, in this case, acts as a near-free trade assurance\nservice and eliminates the need for trust and any incentive of foul play. This\nsimple MAD escrow protection brings significant plus-value to any in-person\ntrade between strangers, whether for small transactions such as on Facebook\nMarketplace trades or luxury goods like, for example, the sale of a piece of art\nor an expensive watch.\n\nAs an additional protection layer when trading with trusted business partners\n\nWhen two people often trade with each other directly, they may end up building\ntrust and not require the full range of costly escrow services offered by\neCommerce platforms. Particl’s escrow system can then function as a near-free\nlayer of additional protection so that both parties don't have to trade naked,\nprotecting each of them against \"long cons\" or sudden shifts in the other\nparty's behavior. \n\nIt allows a buyer and a seller to reap nearly all the benefits of removing\ntraditional marketplace environments and associated fees from their business\nrelationship while keeping a level of trade assurance to protect both parties\nagainst unforeseen risks. Should the worst happen, both parties are incentivized\nto find a solution acceptable to all.\n\nTo sell products that are heavily restricted or even banned by regulated\nentities, such as medicine.\n\nThis possibility opens the door to a whole world of cross-border arbitrage, as\nheavily regulated products often vary wildly in price from one market to\nanother. It can also empower individuals to access products that are removed\nfrom circulation or difficult to acquire in their region, such as is often the\ncase of medicinal products or even literature (i.e., books banned due to a\nspecific political climate in the region).\n\n> N.B.: All of the above-mentioned use-cases are, of course, just a few examples\nof  what a private, decentralized, and two-party escrow makes possible. We hear\nof buyers and sellers with different reasons and benefits that they draw from\nthis system every week, and we’re sure we will continue to hear of new ones as\nadoption of this novel system grows!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn Uncompromising Alternative to Traditional Market Settlements\nA two-party escrow system is unusual and involves a level of commitment that\nsellers and buyers are not often accustomed to. However, as we've just seen, it\nalso comes with powerful upsides that facilitate commerce trades within a wide\nrange of use-cases — the highest of which, in our view, is making possible a\nworldwide, absolutely uncompromisingly open, free, private, and unrestricted\nworld market of goods and services.\n\nSuch a protocol is already a strong complement to traditional escrow models.\nBeyond that, we believe it is bound to hold as a soaring, paradigm-shifting\nalternative in a world where centralized payment processors and financial\nservice providers are becoming more restrictive by the day. And we’re here for\nit.","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/07/2escrow-blog.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/2escrow-blog.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/2escrow-blog.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2022/07/2escrow-blog.jpg 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/07/2escrow-blog.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"></figure><p>Particl is, first and foremost, an ecosystem of privacy-first, decentralized applications.

That is why contract security and enforcement are essential when trading goods and services in any marketplace.</p><p><br>One common solution eCommerce platforms and payment processors use is a mutually-trusted third party — in other words, an escrow agent or “issue resolution center”. In the context of a decentralized marketplace, this incurs a critical problem: the introduction of a centralized moderating entity. It also attracts its own privacy issues as well as some economic drawbacks. Let’s explore what this means for Particl Marketplace.</p><h2 id=\"common-issues-with-traditional-escrow-models\">Common Issues With Traditional Escrow Models</h2><p>With traditional escrow, a third-party (the escrow agent) holds onto an asset and releases it when the transaction is completed (i.e., the purchased item is delivered). That role is generally assumed by the marketplace or exchange itself (i.e., Amazon, Openbazaar), a payment processor (i.e., Paypal, Visa), or third-party escrow services (i.e., a bank or a financial institution). This allows potential disputes or issues to be safely settled, but it also carries important issues.</p><p>Firstly, running escrow or issue resolution services incurs a heavy cost reflected in the platform's fees. When added to every link of a supply chain, this fee ends up substantially impacting retail prices and making up a large portion of the final price of nearly all products we buy daily.</p><p>Additionally, when an issue arises, it is usually settled according to a very rigid set of policies rather than being dealt with on a case-by-case basis. This allows for more issues to be resolved quickly and efficiently but can also lead to biased resolutions that benefit the operator's own bottom line. In turn, scammers have perfected the art of defeating these hard-set policies to steal money, products, or both, from rule-abiding users and sellers. Online merchants are well aware of this problem and hedge their exposure to this risk through their prices, an unfortunate reality that the customer is ultimately led to bear the costs.</p><p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, these solutions offer no privacy at all to their users and incur intrusive data requirements due to the operator needing to be aware of every detail related to a single transaction to fulfill its role. This gives them complete oversight and insight over all the sensitive and, at times, confidential, personal, professional, financial, and commercial data collected from the platform's users — which they, in turn, can use in accordance with their interests, often to the<a href=\"https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/\"> detriment of the individuals and businesses using the platform</a>.</p><h1 id=\"particl-s-two-party-online-escrow-solution\">Particl’s Two-Party Online Escrow Solution</h1><p>Particl adopts a radically different escrow model which addresses the issues mentioned above. Often dubbed a “two-party escrow\", or \"MAD escrow\", it involves only two parties; the buyer and the seller, with no one else in between.</p><p>Instead of requiring a third party to hold the payment on behalf of two transacting parties, both participants are required to provide collateral by making an equal security deposit into a smart-contract. This security deposit can be adjusted from 0 to 100% of the total value of the item or service sold and is <strong>automatically refunded, in its entirety, once both parties mark the transaction as completed</strong>. Notably, this form of decentralized escrow is infinitely scalable, as there are no operating costs associated with running these types of cryptographically-enforced contracts and no escrow agents required for it to function.</p><p>If a dispute or issue arises, both parties need to mutually agree on a satisfying resolution for the transaction to be marked as complete. Because the two parties have a security deposit locked into the escrow smart-contract, they are naturally forced to collaborate and reach a reasonable resolution for both. <strong>This method of escrow allows the Particl marketplace to preserve the privacy of everyone involved in every instance.</strong></p><p>Another important but often overlooked advantage of two-party escrows involves sellers and cash flow. Although 2-of-2 escrow demands a security deposit, which may, on first thought, appear as a cash flow-inhibiting process, it is completely shielded from<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/01/paypal-stole-users-money-after-freezing-seizing-funds-lawsuit-alleges/\"> assets being frozen by entities like Amazon or Paypal</a> in the event of a dispute or perceived terms of use violations. Unfortunately, this is an extremely common reality for providers of services and goods on those platforms and can cause assets to remain in limbo for<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NootropicsDepot/comments/jyeeyh/will_there_ever_be_a_paypal_option_to_pay/\"> up to 6 months or even permanently</a>. For many sellers,<a href=\"https://realbusiness.co.uk/paypal-is-becoming-toxic-to-small-business\"> such a risk could prove fatal to their business</a>.</p><h2 id=\"mutually-assured-destruction-game-theory\">Mutually Assured Destruction Game Theory</h2><p>By definition, game theory simply refers to the<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory\"> study of mathematical models of strategic interaction among rational decision-makers</a>. In other words, it incentivizes rational decision-making and simultaneously disincentivizes irrational/dishonest behavior.</p><p>To accomplish that desired outcome within the context of a two-party escrow system, Particl leverages the Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) game theory in a financial context. “MAD” is a military doctrine “<em>based on the theory of deterrence, which stipulates that the threat of using strong weapons against the enemy prevents the enemy’s use of those same weapons. The strategy is a form of Nash equilibrium in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to initiate a conflict or to disarm”</em> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction\">Wikipedia</a>).</p><p>By combining Particl’s implementation of<a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki\"> BIP 65</a> , which allows a transaction output to be made unspendable until some point in the future, with the advanced<a href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\"> trustless data transmission capabilities of the SMSG network</a>, the marketplace’s two-party escrow system locks funds in a secure multi-signature smart-contract until all parties sign off on the transaction.

It promised us, the people, a level of financial and\neconomic freedom truly never seen before.\n\nBut is Bitcoin really enough, and can it survive the onslaught of government\nregulations and control coming its way? The answer is nuanced and more complex\nthan most like to admit.\n\nThe Worrying Reality of Financial Spying\nAs we've seen in previous Particl stories (1\n[https://particl.news/the-internet-is-centralized-that-spells-trouble-for-all-of-us/]\n, 2 [https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/], 3\n[https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/]), the web is\nundergoing a worrying trend of centralization and data consumption abuse. Every\nday, online services that you use collect more and more data about yourself so\nthat they can be used, shared, and monetized by corporations - generally\nwithout\nyour informed consent\n[https://particl.news/gdpr-and-consent-based-privacy-regulations-flaws/]. That\ndata is disseminated to all sorts of interested parties, going from corporations\nto governments, all the way to politically motivated groups who would like to\nuse it against you or for their own motives.\n\nIt is now common knowledge that governments around the world track our financial\nlife. With collaboration from the banks and payment service companies, many\ngovernments can, at any time, request any level of financial information about\nyou. And while a lot of us may not have anything particularly nefarious to hide,\nit still impacts and involves us in very concrete ways! Let's look at a very\nrecent example illustrating perfectly the risks associated with traceable\nfinancial data.\n\nBe Careful How You Partake in Politics - Or You'll Get the Stick\nYou've probably heard of the \"trucker protests\" that unfolded earlier this year;\nstarted in Canada, these anti-mandate, anti-lockdown protests subsequently\ninspired other similar convoys in other countries. This protest turned into a\nbig political arm-wrestling match, with both sides of the political spectrum\nframing them either as a prime example of peaceful demonstration or as an\nirresponsible demonstration of carelessness sometimes nearing terrorism.\n\nAnd as any major political and partisan event these days unfolds, the internet\nlit up and both sides mobilized to try and ridicule or destroy the other side.\n\nMobilizing many individuals for such an extended period of time takes funds, and\nthose funds typically come in the form of donations. Thousands of people all\naround the world donated to the trucker movement, only for GoFundMe to block\nthe\nfundraising and threaten to redirect the funds to charities of their choosing\n[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gofundme-freedom-convoy-under-investigation-for-blocking-donations-canadian-truckers/] \n(which, under pressure, they opted against in favor of reimbursing people). In\nresponse, pro-convoy members of the public started using a little known yet more\nopen donation service: GiveSendGo.\n\nGiveSendGo advertised itself as a free (as in freedom) donation service that\nwould support the movement and not interfere with the donations. But it wasn’t\nto be: a few days after donations started to flock in, the website was exploited\nand hacked, which led to the \"doxing\" of thousands of donors\n[https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/14/freedom-convoy-donor-leak-givesendgo/]. Their\nnames, email addresses, ZIP codes, and IP addresses were made public. The\nhorror! And in such a politically charged climate, one can imagine the potential\nimpact such a leak could have on the private lives of people who donated to the\ntrucker convoy.\n\nNo matter one's political opinion on this two-fold example, truth is that the\nissue it highlights is relevant to almost any heated topic, be it political or\nnot. Financial privacy is of utmost importance in a day and age where data can\nbe weaponized. \n\nThis tells us is that the web sorely needs to improve on two things when it\ncomes to digital payments. One, there is a need for payments to go truly digital\nand trustless so that they can't be frozen, reversed, or blocked. And two, there\nis a clear and broad need for some payments to be accomplished anonymously to\nprotect the personal and financial data of those making transactions.\n\nAnd then came Bitcoin\nBitcoin, the father of cryptocurrencies, offered us half of the solution: a\nrevolutionary method of payment that could not be seized, frozen, reversed, or\nblocked.\n\nUnfortunately, we’ve seen some very concerning events unfold in just the past\nfew weeks – from Ethereum service provider Infura and Metamask freezing crypto\naccounts\n[https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/03/metamask-infura-block-certain-areas-amid-crypto-sanctions-fury/]\n, to the so-called decentralized marketplace OpenSea blocking off users from\ntheir assets on the basis on their Russian nationality\n[https://medium.com/coinmonks/as-metamask-and-opensea-abide-by-us-sanctions-the-russian-ban-is-in-the-spotlight-67611df121f8]\n. This all boils down to cryptocurrency users too often depending on centralized\nentities.\n\nBitcoin and cryptocurrencies are still providing all the freedom they set out to\nprovide; but if you use third-party services, you in effect forfeit true\nownership of your coins and go back to the old patterns of not owning your\nmoney. Pro-tip: Always use non-custodial wallets and be very careful which\nservice you send your coins to!\n\nA question however remains: how did these companies know the identity and\nnationality of the owners of certain crypto addresses in the first place?\n\nBitcoin: Often Anything but Anonymous\nIn a day and age where financial data is worth gold, Bitcoin suffers from a\nterrible Achille's heel: all transactions are transparent and publicly displayed\non an open ledger, and all the financial data of its holders in effect become\navailable information. And that's becoming increasingly worrying as blockchain\ntracing firms and crypto service providers are now in possession of very\ninvasive and effective technology to trace Bitcoin payments.\n\nTo illustrate the sad reality of today's Bitcoin, see it this way. How would you\nfeel walking down the street, with a picture of your bank account and credit\ncard(s) balances stamped on your forehead? Anyone that walks past you and that\nis curious enough to look up would see exactly how much you own and in which\naccount. They would also be able to see exactly with who you’ve transacted since\nyou opened your accounts. They could see exactly what you bought, what you\ninvested in, how much you donated to whom, a full and precise picture of your\nrevenue and savings, and so on. Clearly, no one in their right mind would do\nthis.\n\nIn many cases, this is precisely what Bitcoin does to your financial information\nnow. With all the tracing tech around, combined with the need to KYC yourself to\nuse almost any exchange or service provider, anyone curious enough can simply\nquery the publicly available information, draft a provably accurate and very\nprecise picture of your finances, and know exactly who's financial profile that\nis.\n\nThe array of people that can now know this information extends from governments\nand banks, to almost any corporation or private individual. A notable \"step\ndown\" from the traditional financial system when it comes to financial privacy.\n\nA Good Crypto is a Private Crypto\nAs great as Bitcoin sounds, it is having a hard time realizing its initial\nvision - even after 14 years of existence - precisely because of those privacy\nissues. Luckily, it's not the only digital currency around.\n\nWe've seen a few cryptocurrencies focus solely on this issue of privacy, making\nthem very good candidates to be considered as true alternatives to cash and as\ngreat settlement layers for the web of today and tomorrow.\n\nAmongst them there is Monero, which uses the very solid RingCT privacy protocol,\nor Firo with its more exotic privacy setup. We also have Zcash, a very\nwell-known privacy coin - and many others. Each of them presents a different\ntwist to the angle of privacy and comes with different codebases, strengths, and\nlimitations.\n\nBut privacy generally comes with concessions in flexibility. While the examples\nmentioned above are great alternatives to Bitcoin because of the privacy they\nprovide, their use-case is pretty much limited to person-to-person currency\ntransactions. And although they accomplish their purpose well, a lot of\npotentials is left unexploited, especially as we've seen, in recent years, the\nadvent of \"dapps\" (distributed applications) and of Web3, a new \"take\" on the\nweb that promises data ownership and to do away with centralized parties.\n\nBecause of the limitations of privacy coins, they, unfortunately, cannot be used\nin any Dapp or be an important part of Web3. And in reality, all the promises of\nWeb3 are more or less moot if its settlement layer is not private. They will\nfall prey to the same issues mentioned earlier in this article - whether it is\nWeb2 or Web3.\n\nA Modern Privacy Coin Fills That Gap\nThat is what motivated us to build PART [https://particl.io/coin]. It is a\nmodern privacy coin that uses the most battle-tested codebase, Bitcoin, and the\nmost battle-tested privacy protocol, RingCT (the same privacy protocol used by\nMonero). But unlike other privacy coins, PART [https://particl.io/coin] is built\nwith flexibility in mind, so that it can be used in Dapps and on Web3. Case in\npoint: PART is currently the default settlement layer of Particl Marketplace\n[https://particl.io/marketplace], a decentralized and private eBay-like\nmarketplace, where one can buy and sell anything without fees, middlemen, or\nrestrictions.\n\nBy leveraging the flexible Bitcoin codebase and adding to it solid privacy\ntechnologies, PART succeeds in fixing Bitcoin's biggest problem of financial\nspying, all the while being available for use as settlement for this new wave of\nWeb3 applications. It’s basically getting the cake and eating it too.\n\nAnd to add more merit to it, we've designed it in a way to be fully compatible\nwith the Lightning Network - meaning any scalability or high fee concern that\none might have with privacy coins is completely a thing of the past. PART is\nindeed completely private, almost infinitely scalable, and near-free to\ntransact.\n\nWith PART [https://particl.io/coin], we intend to give you full absolute control\nover your money in a way that's safe and future-proof. We are excited to move\nforward and keep on innovating within the Web3 space with tech that keeps you\nand your information safe from prying eyes.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf that sounds great to you, then we encourage you to learn more about PART\n[https://particl.io/coin]'s cryptocurrency and the suite of Web3 applications\nwe're building (marketplace, DEX, messaging app, etc) here [https://particl.io/]\n, and join our awesome and motivated global community on Telegram\n[https://t.me/particlOn], Element\n[https://riot.im/app/#/room/#particl:matrix.org] or Discord\n[https://discord.me/particl]!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJoin the discussion\nWhat's your stance?

Every day, online services that you use collect more and more data about yourself so that they can be used, shared, and monetized by corporations - <a href=\"https://particl.news/gdpr-and-consent-based-privacy-regulations-flaws/\">generally without your informed consent</a>. That data is disseminated to all sorts of interested parties, going from corporations to governments, all the way to politically motivated groups who would like to use it against you or for their own motives.</p><p>It is now common knowledge that governments around the world track our financial life. With collaboration from the banks and payment service companies, many governments can, at any time, request any level of financial information about you. And while a lot of us may not have anything particularly nefarious to hide, it still impacts and involves us in very concrete ways! Let's look at a very recent example illustrating perfectly the risks associated with traceable financial data.</p><h2 id=\"be-careful-how-you-partake-in-politics-or-you-ll-get-the-stick\">Be Careful How You Partake in Politics - Or You'll Get the Stick</h2><p>You've probably heard of the \"trucker protests\" that unfolded earlier this year; started in Canada, these anti-mandate, anti-lockdown protests subsequently inspired other similar convoys in other countries. This protest turned into a big political arm-wrestling match, with both sides of the political spectrum framing them either as a prime example of peaceful demonstration or as an irresponsible demonstration of carelessness sometimes nearing terrorism.</p><p>And as any major political and partisan event these days unfolds, the internet lit up and both sides mobilized to try and ridicule or destroy the other side.</p><p>Mobilizing many individuals for such an extended period of time takes funds, and those funds typically come in the form of donations. Thousands of people all around the world donated to the trucker movement, only for GoFundMe to <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gofundme-freedom-convoy-under-investigation-for-blocking-donations-canadian-truckers/\">block the fundraising and threaten to redirect the funds to charities of their choosing</a> (which, under pressure, they opted against in favor of reimbursing people). In response, pro-convoy members of the public started using a little known yet more open donation service: GiveSendGo.</p><p>GiveSendGo advertised itself as a free (as in freedom) donation service that would support the movement and not interfere with the donations. But it wasn’t to be: a few days after donations started to flock in, the website was exploited and hacked, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/14/freedom-convoy-donor-leak-givesendgo/\">led to the \"doxing\" of thousands of donors</a>. Their names, email addresses, ZIP codes, and IP addresses were made public. The horror! And in such a politically charged climate, one can imagine the potential impact such a leak could have on the private lives of people who donated to the trucker convoy.</p><p>No matter one's political opinion on this two-fold example, truth is that the issue it highlights is relevant to almost any heated topic, be it political or not. Financial privacy is of utmost importance in a day and age where data can be weaponized. </p><p>This tells us is that the web sorely needs to improve on two things when it comes to digital payments. One, there is a need for payments to go truly digital and trustless so that they can't be frozen, reversed, or blocked. And two, there is a clear and broad need for some payments to be accomplished anonymously to protect the personal and financial data of those making transactions.</p><h2 id=\"and-then-came-bitcoin\">And then came Bitcoin</h2><p>Bitcoin, the father of cryptocurrencies, offered us half of the solution: a revolutionary method of payment that could not be seized, frozen, reversed, or blocked.</p><p>Unfortunately, we’ve seen some very concerning events unfold in just the past few weeks – from <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/03/metamask-infura-block-certain-areas-amid-crypto-sanctions-fury/\">Ethereum service provider Infura and Metamask freezing crypto accounts</a>, to <a href=\"https://medium.com/coinmonks/as-metamask-and-opensea-abide-by-us-sanctions-the-russian-ban-is-in-the-spotlight-67611df121f8\">the so-called decentralized marketplace OpenSea blocking off users from their assets on the basis on their Russian nationality</a>. This all boils down to cryptocurrency users too often depending on centralized entities.</p><p>Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are still providing all the freedom they set out to provide; but if you use third-party services, you in effect forfeit true ownership of your coins and go back to the old patterns of not owning your money.

And that's becoming increasingly worrying as blockchain tracing firms and crypto service providers are now in possession of very invasive and effective technology to trace Bitcoin payments.</p><p>To illustrate the sad reality of today's Bitcoin, see it this way. How would you feel walking down the street, with a picture of your bank account and credit card(s) balances stamped on your forehead? Anyone that walks past you and that is curious enough to look up would see exactly how much you own and in which account. They would also be able to see exactly with who you’ve transacted since you opened your accounts. They could see exactly what you bought, what you invested in, how much you donated to whom, a full and precise picture of your revenue and savings, and so on. Clearly, no one in their right mind would do this.</p><p>In many cases, this is precisely what Bitcoin does to your financial information now. With all the tracing tech around, combined with the need to KYC yourself to use almost any exchange or service provider, anyone curious enough can simply query the publicly available information, draft a provably accurate and very precise picture of your finances, and know exactly who's financial profile that is.</p><p>The array of people that can now know this information extends from governments and banks, to almost any corporation or private individual. A notable \"step down\" from the traditional financial system when it comes to financial privacy.</p><h2 id=\"a-good-crypto-is-a-private-crypto\">A Good Crypto is a Private Crypto</h2><p>As great as Bitcoin sounds, it is having a hard time realizing its initial vision - even after 14 years of existence - precisely because of those privacy issues. Luckily, it's not the only digital currency around.</p><p>We've seen a few cryptocurrencies focus solely on this issue of privacy, making them very good candidates to be considered as true alternatives to cash and as great settlement layers for the web of today and tomorrow.</p><p>Amongst them there is Monero, which uses the very solid RingCT privacy protocol, or Firo with its more exotic privacy setup. We also have Zcash, a very well-known privacy coin - and many others. Each of them presents a different twist to the angle of privacy and comes with different codebases, strengths, and limitations.</p><p>But privacy generally comes with concessions in flexibility. While the examples mentioned above are great alternatives to Bitcoin because of the privacy they provide, their use-case is pretty much limited to person-to-person currency transactions. And although they accomplish their purpose well, a lot of potentials is left unexploited, especially as we've seen, in recent years, the advent of \"dapps\" (distributed applications) and of Web3, a new \"take\" on the web that promises data ownership and to do away with centralized parties.</p><p>Because of the limitations of privacy coins, they, unfortunately, cannot be used in any Dapp or be an important part of Web3. And in reality, all the promises of Web3 are more or less moot if its settlement layer is not private. They will fall prey to the same issues mentioned earlier in this article - whether it is Web2 or Web3.</p><h2 id=\"a-modern-privacy-coin-fills-that-gap\">A Modern Privacy Coin Fills That Gap</h2><p>That is what motivated us to build <strong><a href=\"https://particl.io/coin\">PART</a></strong>. It is a modern privacy coin that uses the most battle-tested codebase, Bitcoin, and the most battle-tested privacy protocol, RingCT (the same privacy protocol used by Monero). But unlike other privacy coins, <strong><a href=\"https://particl.io/coin\">PART</a></strong> is built with flexibility in mind, so that it can be used in Dapps and on Web3. Case in point: PART is currently the default settlement layer of <strong><a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</a></strong>, a decentralized and private eBay-like marketplace, where one can buy and sell anything without fees, middlemen, or restrictions.</p><p>By leveraging the flexible Bitcoin codebase and adding to it solid privacy technologies, PART succeeds in fixing Bitcoin's biggest problem of financial spying, all the while being available for use as settlement for this new wave of Web3 applications.

Indeed, we can now go as far as saying that only\nthree things are guaranteed in life: taxation, death, and your personal\ninformation leaking to undesirable parties.\n\n“But I have nothing to hide, so why should I care?” one might say. Well, aside\nfrom having your identity stolen or your credit card filled up with fraudulent\npurchases, there’s one ugly fact that is barely understood by anyone: the risk\nof having your own thoughts being used against you. We know, this sounds...weird\nand vague, but the 2016 American presidential election is, as we’ll see, a\nfantastic example of this often-overlooked phenomenon associated with data\nmining.\n\nThe lessons we can learn from the Cambridge Analytica \"scandal\"\nNovember 2016 saw the election of a highly polarizing figure to the American\npresidency: Donald J. Trump. Whether one’s opinion on the man is negative or\npositive, there is a good chance that it is not neutral.\n\nIn 2016, Trump’s presidential campaign contracted Cambridge Analytica\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica], a big data firm that\nspecialized in analyzing data and selling the conclusions of their research to\ninterested parties, to help craft them narratives and political strategies.\nCambridge Analytica, on their “about” web page, touted an impressive 5000 data\npoints per person, targeting 220 million Americans\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20160216023554/https://cambridgeanalytica.org/about]\n, and used that data to create personality models for those people. That\ninformation, if you could afford it, was highly valuable to the Trump campaign’s\nambitions – and with the help of Cambridge Analytica, they gathered as much\ninformation on American voters as they possibly could. What do they like, or\nfear? What are the biggest issues? What triggers in them the most emotion? Who\ndo they talk to? Where do they hang out? What is the best way to catch their\nattention? The list was extensive\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html]\n.\n\nAs it turned out, even when people disliked Trump, they talked about him a lot,\nand often on social media. This created intense debates of ideas, creating the\nconditions for all the data Cambridge Analytica needed to advise the Trump\ncampaign on how to best move forward. Simply talking about him on social media\nis very likely to have contributed to his unexpected 306-to-232 victory.\n\nIt’s clear in hindsight that our discourse allowed Cambridge to craft very apt\npolitical narratives in order to appeal to a large part of the population –\noften alienated from common politicians - and provided all the information\nrequired to draft an election strategy. Ironically, the polemic around Trump –\nhow controversial he was as a political figure – directly contributed to his\nvictory. In the end, for slightly more than half of American voters, their data\nwas in effect used against them.\n\nAn institutional problem\nBut here’s the real cherry on top: every single political party, on either side\nof the aisle, every corporation, think tank, research firm, every special\ninterest group - they are all guilty of the exact same thing the Trump campaign\ndid with Cambridge Analytica. They all do it, almost without exception – the\nstakes are too high not to, and the bottom lines too attractive.\n\nAnd so, whenever you log online and discuss with others, do research, scroll up\nor down and spend X amount of seconds on this or that social media post, you\ngenerate data that not only could leak and expose you to malicious actors, but\nalso be used to profile and track you, and often against your own interests.\n\nIf you’re an online vendor, for example, then it’s your sales volume and page\ntraffic that will be collected sometimes by competitors, other times by the\neCommerce platform you’re using. And this valuable data can then be used to put\nyou out of business.\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/] \nIt happened, it still happens, and it’ll keep happening. In fact, the problem of\nyour data being used against you go far beyond politics and can reach every\nsingle aspect of your life. It probably already did and you may not even be\naware of; how could you in the first place?\n\nSo how do we stop this? How do we protect our digital sovereignty and opt out of\nthis toxic dynamic?\n\nUnfortunately, it seems impossible if you use traditional web technologies, or\nwhat is increasingly being referred to as “web2”. With cookies, data sharing\npolicies, and monetization, there’s little to no way to escape from this. It’s\nfor “advertisement purposes”, they say. But we all certainly know better!\n\nFor example, what if you want to buy something online? Then you have to go on a\nwebsite that uses various plugins and third-party services. The most obvious\nbeing a payment processor and/or bank, a domain host, a website/server host, a\nweb platform (i.e., Wordpress and its plugins), an e-commerce solution (Amazon,\neBay, Shopify), etc. All of these third-parties collect their own set of data,\naccording to what they want to know about you (and how much they plan on\nmonetize your information), and then, they share it to even more partners that,\nin turn, monetize your data and probably share it with their own partners as\nwell. A simple purchase on Amazon spreads your personal information in all\ndirections with absolutely no control or consent on your end (and as we’ve seen, \nagreeing to pop up privacy and cookie policies does a poor job at slowing this\ndata pandemic down\n[https://particl.news/gdpr-and-consent-based-privacy-regulations-flaws/]]).\n\nGiven time, every problem finds its solution\nThis state of affairs was a big motivation behind our development of the \nParticl\nMarketplace [https://particl.io/marketplace] - a decentralized, peer-to-peer\nmarketplace with no middleman and no data collection whatsoever. All\ntransactions are made person-to-person with no unauthorized party having access\nto any single piece of information. Our privacy coin is also a major aspect of\nwhy it works; all trades are inherently private and anonymous, protecting both\nbuyers and sellers from having their data harvested by scrapers and unscrupulous\nintermediaries. Calling it the world’s safest and most private way to buy and\nsell anything online is no exaggeration because if no data is generated in the\nfirst place, then it can’t be collected. And that’s precisely how we roll!\n\nWith the state of the internet today, it is high time we get back to being\nskeptical and careful about who we share our data with; it’s never been as much\nof a problem as it is now and one would be ill-advised to think this will get\nbetter on its own, without us taking the appropriate steps required to protect\nourselves.

Trump. Whether one’s opinion on the man is negative or positive, there is a good chance that it is not neutral.</p><p>In 2016, Trump’s presidential campaign contracted <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica\">Cambridge Analytica</a>, a big data firm that specialized in analyzing data and selling the conclusions of their research to interested parties, to help craft them narratives and political strategies. Cambridge Analytica, on their “about” web page, touted an impressive <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160216023554/https://cambridgeanalytica.org/about\">5000 data points per person, targeting 220 million Americans</a>, and used that data to create personality models for those people. That information, if you could afford it, was highly valuable to the Trump campaign’s ambitions – and with the help of Cambridge Analytica, they gathered as much information on American voters as they possibly could. What do they like, or fear? What are the biggest issues? What triggers in them the most emotion? Who do they talk to? Where do they hang out? What is the best way to catch their attention? <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html\">The list was extensive</a>.</p><p>As it turned out, even when people disliked Trump, they talked about him a lot, and often on social media. This created intense debates of ideas, creating the conditions for all the data Cambridge Analytica needed to advise the Trump campaign on how to best move forward. Simply talking about him on social media is very likely to have contributed to his unexpected 306-to-232 victory.</p><p>It’s clear in hindsight that our discourse allowed Cambridge to craft very apt political narratives in order to appeal to a large part of the population – often alienated from common politicians - and provided all the information required to draft an election strategy. Ironically, the polemic around Trump – how controversial he was as a political figure – directly contributed to his victory. In the end, for slightly more than half of American voters, their data was in effect used against them.</p><h2 id=\"an-institutional-problem\">An institutional problem</h2><p>But here’s the real cherry on top: every single political party, on either side of the aisle, every corporation, think tank, research firm, every special interest group - they are all guilty of the exact same thing the Trump campaign did with Cambridge Analytica. They all do it, almost without exception – the stakes are too high not to, and the bottom lines too attractive.</p><p>And so, whenever you log online and discuss with others, do research, scroll up or down and spend X amount of seconds on this or that social media post, you generate data that not only could leak and expose you to malicious actors, but also be used to profile and track you, and often against your own interests.</p><p>If you’re an online vendor, for example, then it’s your sales volume and page traffic that will be collected sometimes by competitors, other times by the eCommerce platform you’re using. And <a href=\"https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/\">this valuable data can then be used to put you out of business.</a> It happened, it still happens, and it’ll keep happening.

How do we protect our digital sovereignty and opt out of this toxic dynamic?</p><p>Unfortunately, it seems impossible if you use traditional web technologies, or what is increasingly being referred to as “web2”. With cookies, data sharing policies, and monetization, there’s little to no way to escape from this. It’s for “advertisement purposes”, they say. But we all certainly know better!</p><p>For example, what if you want to buy something online? Then you have to go on a website that uses various plugins and third-party services. The most obvious being a payment processor and/or bank, a domain host, a website/server host, a web platform (i.e., Wordpress and its plugins), an e-commerce solution (Amazon, eBay, Shopify), etc. All of these third-parties collect their own set of data, according to what they want to know about you (and how much they plan on monetize your information), and then, they share it to even more partners that, in turn, monetize your data and probably share it with their own partners as well. A simple purchase on Amazon spreads your personal information in all directions with absolutely no control or consent on your end (and as we’ve seen, <a href=\"https://particl.news/gdpr-and-consent-based-privacy-regulations-flaws/]\">agreeing to pop up privacy and cookie policies does a poor job at slowing this data pandemic down</a>).</p><h2 id=\"given-time-every-problem-finds-its-solution\">Given time, every problem finds its solution</h2><p>This state of affairs was a big motivation behind our development of the <strong><a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</a></strong> - a decentralized, peer-to-peer marketplace with no middleman and no data collection whatsoever.

And that’s precisely how we roll!</p><p>With the state of the internet today, it is high time we get back to being skeptical and careful about who we share our data with; it’s never been as much of a problem as it is now and one would be ill-advised to think this will get better on its own, without us taking the appropriate steps required to protect ourselves.

As\na result, not much is changing in practice from a data collection and usage\nperspective. The same is true for most companies that have started to do\nmarketing out of their \"strong privacy policies\". It has become a marketing\nbuzzword, and when you dig deeper, you realize they are still collecting, using,\nsharing, and often losing your data.\n\nIn concrete terms, the GDPR and most other data regulations only require\ncompanies to disclose what data they collect and what they do with it. Then,\nthey have to get you to accept those terms and conditions. Oftentimes, if you\ndon't accept, you simply won’t be able to use the product or platform, or\nsometimes only in a limited manner. It is also an obvious fact that most people\nsimply accept TOCs without really reading them, since these \"requests for data\nuse\" pop up almost everywhere you go online now and just take too much time to\nproperly read through.\n\nOther times, for instance when you want to register to a marketplace like Amazon\nor Ebay, simply registering to the platform means that you agree to their TOCs\non data collection and usage. Don’t agree with them overlooking your every move?\nThen you are refused services and can’t do business on their platform. And you\nwould be well-advised not to accept these terms in many cases.

This results in honest sellers going out of business thanks to the very own\ndata they provided to e-commerce platforms. Deep down, do you really agree to\nthis when using a marketplace - or are you merely being coerced into accepting\nwhat's being imposed on you?\n\nThere seemingly is no real alternative to protect your data when browsing the\nweb anymore. All platforms collect your information, a lot of them lose it to\nhackers or due to gross negligence, and multiple parties still track your every\nmove, GDPR or not.\n\nThe Golden Promise of Decentralized E-Commerce\n\nDecentralized apps, privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, and decentralized\nmarketplaces are in a prime position to tackle the issue from the core. The\nability to buy and sell anything with no middleman, directly person-to-person,\nand with no restrictions sends us back to the original principles of cash\ntransactions while transcending physical borders and promising equal access to\nall. Although in a nascent stage, it can be said for many to be the future of\ne-commerce.\n\nMany decentralized marketplaces, however, have a critical weakness that could\npotentially make them worse than even traditional marketplaces like Amazon. In\nthe case of traditional blockchain technology, all the data is tracked on a\npublic blockchain or over publicly-accessible networks. That oversight, combined\nwith increasingly sophisticated blockchain tracing and blockchain data mining,\nmeans all of that data is publicly viewable to anyone. So now, it's not just the\nmarketplace and its partners that have access to your data, it’s whoever is\ncurious enough to simply look it up. That’s bad if you're an individual, and\ncritically damaging if you are a business that ends up revealing their critical\ndata to competitors.\n\nIn some other cases, decentralized marketplaces are not entirely decentralized\nand various data sets go directly through third-parties or central authorities;\nessentially bringing us back to the very same core issues observed with typical\ne-commerce platforms built on traditional web technology.\n\nYes, the Solution is De-Commerce, BUT With Full Privacy\nThis is precisely the raison d’etre of Particl Marketplace\n[https://particl.io/marketplace].

As you can imagine, this topic can rapidly\nlead to fiery debates on the level of privacy certain protocol implementations\noffer and as to why a certain currency was designed the way it is.\n\nWe’d like, today, to clarify our position on this topic and detail why we’ve\ndecided to follow this particular path.\n\n> Note: In this article, we often refer to RingCT transactions as “anon\ntransactions\". These are used as synonyms.\nTable of Contents\n * About Particl's Native Currency; PART\n * What are Particl Distributed Apps\n * The Need for Public Balances\n * About Particl’s Privacy\n * How Does RingCT Work?\n * Leveraging Particl Applications to Boost Privacy\n * New Privacy Boons Abound\n * So, Should PART Become Private-by-Default?\n * Particl Desktop Privacy Improvements on the Way!\n * Synergy and Collaboration, not Tribalism and Exclusion\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout Particl’s Native Currency; PART\nBefore we get into the nitty-gritty details as to why PART uses an opt-in\nprivacy setup rather than mandating all transactions to be private, it’s\nimportant to understand the context of PART's existence and know what is its\npurpose within the wider Particl ecosystem.\n\nTaken at face value, PART is a proof-of-stake privacy coin that uses the same\nprivacy protocol as Monero (RingCT) but uses the Bitcoin codebase instead of the\nmore rigid Cryptonote one.\n\nThis difference in codebases makes a world of differences. Indeed, leveraging\nthe Bitcoin codebase enables PART to benefit from the sheer strength of the\nentire Bitcoin ecosystem and developer community. That means more developers\nauditing and contributing to the code (Taproot, LN, etc), more stability, and\nmore products and releases to benefit from (Copay, Electrum, etc). But perhaps\nmore importantly, that also means much more flexibility.\n\nAnd that’s where PART shines uniquely and really sets itself apart from other\nprivacy coins. While it uses the proven-effective but typically rigid RingCT and\nCT protocols, it possesses all of Bitcoin's flexibility; massively expanding its\nutility as more than just a private currency. \n\nThis added flexibility makes it possible to use the coin in simple Bitcoin-style\nsmart-contracts and multi-signature contracts. But don’t get fooled by the word\n“basic”, what can be done with “simple smart-contracts” is pretty astonishing in\nitself as demonstrated by distributed apps like Particl Marketplace\n[https://particl.io/marketplace] (decentralized e-commerce) and the recent\nTaproot developments. More on that shortly.\n\nWhat is PART’s Real Intended Purpose?\nWhen we, the Particl team, first envisioned and designed the Particl project, we\nhad a very clear mission in mind: building an ecosystem of distributed\napplications that respect your rights and freedoms. This is our primary focus\nand all further design decisions follow that guiding line.\n\nWe are building these applications for everyone—freedom seekers, the persecuted\nand censored, big and small online sellers, online shoppers, the “typical\ninternet user”, and, among many other types of people, privacy enthusiasts too.\n\nIn that sense, building a privacy coin that only serves as a medium of exchange\nisn’t our objective. PART is a multi-purpose, privacy-focused currency that is\nmore akin to a tool than only a currency. By design, it needs to be flexible\nenough to accomplish various functions within the Particl ecosystem, which is\nachieved by leveraging the benefits of the Bitcoin codebase.\n\nIt is with this need for both multi-purpose flexibility and privacy that we’ve\ndesigned PART’s privacy setup and why we’re confident that it’s doing exactly\nwhat we intended it to do in the first place.\n\nWhat are Particl Distributed Apps\nTo give you a better idea of our vision, let's take one of the distributed\napplications of the Particl ecosystem. Particl Marketplace is a decentralized\nand private-by-default online marketplace that lets you buy and sell anything\nonline with no restriction. Think of it like an eBay, but without any middleman,\ndata mining, restriction, or sales fee/commission.\n\nThis marketplace is made possible thanks to many pieces fitting together: the\nflexibility of the Bitcoin smart-contracts, the use of a custom and unique P2P\nmessaging layer (SMSG), the privacy benefits of the RingCT protocol, a\ndistributed governance system, the anonymity of the Tor network, and the\nsmart-contract capabilities of the Bitcoin-based CT protocol.\n\nAs PART itself directly powers some of these functions (i.e., content\nmoderation), its multi-purpose nature becomes clearer. And as some of these\nfunctions cannot work using anon balances and transactions, the debate on\nwhether we should mandate private transactions or not suddenly becomes more\nnuanced.\n\nThe Need for Public Balances\nRingCT transactions are, by design, quite rigid as their outputs are not\nprogrammable. This prevents anon balances to be used in more complex scenarios,\non various platforms, and for certain use-cases. To circumvent this limitation,\nParticl leverages both public (Bitcoin-like) and CT transactions\n[https://blockstream.com/bitcoin17-final41.pdf]. This “protocol flexibility” is\none of the coin’s most important strengths and expands its utility beyond what\nit could be if it was working exclusively using RingCT.\n\nWhat are Public Balances Used for?\nAt this time, here’s a list of some components of the Particl ecosystem that\nrequire public balances to function:\n\n * The Particl Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism, including cold staking\n   and cold staking pools. There is, however, an option to receive all staking\n   rewards using RingCT or CT transactions for those looking for that extra\n   layer of privacy. To learn more about how to do this, please refer to this\n   article\n   [https://particl.news/private-cold-staking-script-released-d8900e193490/].\n * Particl's decentralized treasury which funds community initiatives.\n * The community governance system [https://ccs.particl.io/] which allows\n   stakeholders to vote on important decisions with their stake weight.\n * The Particl Marketplace community moderation system which lets the users\n   moderate undesirable content off of the marketplace and fight off spam on the\n   platform.\n * The mobile wallet Particl Copay.\n * The light wallet Particl Electrum (desktop and mobile) which is expected to\n   power future mobile and web releases.\n * Hardware devices such as the Ledger Nano S and the Trezor.\n\nAnd, although Particl Marketplace’s two-party escrow system\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_escrow.html] doesn’t rely\non public transactions, it still requires CT transactions to link RingCT outputs\ntogether to provide its anonymity. You can read more on how this is done by\nchecking out this article\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd/].\n\nAs you can see, many critical components of the Particl ecosystem entirely rely\non public balances and transactions. Making PART private-by-default or outright\nmandating private transactions would cause a significant setback and even force\nthe project to abandon some of its core components. This would go in direct\nopposition of our mission.\n\nWhat About Exchanges?\nAnother downside associated with having a private-by-default cryptocurrency has\nto do with the ever-evolving legal landscape of the blockchain industry. As is\nbecoming more evident by the day, regulations are tightening, notably around the\nuse of “privacy coins”. As a result, a lot of leading exchanges have resorted to\ndelisting and/or not entertaining adding privacy coins as a way to protect\nthemselves and ensure that they remain compliant.\n\nWith Particl’s relatively precarious presence on exchanges, having the main\ntransaction type be transparent is a definite upside.\n\nAnd even though exchanges could, in theory, change the type of transactions they\naccept if Particl were to switch to a private-by-default model, they may not be\ninclined to do so purely based on the fact that PART itself has relatively low\nliquidity and volume. The effort involved with implementing that change at the\nexchange level, coupled with the legal uncertainty of accepting privacy coins,\nmay simply not be worth it for exchanges. This could lead to a delisting and\nreduction of accessibility to the PART coin; something that cannot be neglected\nas the coin needs to be as accessible as possible for Particl to accomplish its\nmission.\n\nAuditing the Circulating Supply\nEverything in life has trade-offs. With cryptocurrencies that mandate private\ntransactions like Monero, the added privacy is counter-balanced by the fact that\nthe circulating supply cannot be properly audited with full certainty. And\nalthough the reasons that may cause supply inflation are usually considered more\ntheoretical than practical, they are real risks nonetheless.\n\nBy having public balances on which people hold funds and stake from, you can\ndetermine, with more accuracy, whether or not the total number of coins in\ncirculation is as expected. As the Monero team best wrote it: “(…) the use of\ntransparent fund migration means that an attempt to move enough exploited funds\nthrough the transparent Zcash pool could be detected (…)”. On that note, we\nhighly recommend reading Monero’s well-thought-out response on the topic of\nsupply auditability [https://www.getmonero.org/2020/01/17/auditability.html],\nhow it relates to private (“opaque”) cryptocurrencies, and the trade-offs\ninvolved with this.\n\nIn our particular case, supply auditability isn’t the main reason why we’ve\nopted against mandating private transactions, but it’s certainly an appreciable\nbenefit.\n\nTransaction Speed\nOne non-negligible benefit of having public balances is the faster speed of\ntransaction settlements on Particl. While both public and anon transactions use\nblock confirmation times of 2 minutes, public balances are usable after 1\nconfirmation (~2 minutes) while anon balances can only be used once the funds it\ncontains have reached 12 confirmations (~24 minutes).\n\nThis speed is handy in many situations and straight up required in others,\nnotably in the context of certain Particl applications where the public balance\nholds a key role (i.e., moderating marketplace content).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout PART’s Privacy\nAlthough PART is a multi-purpose coin that accomplishes different functions\nwithin the ecosystem—and, as we’ve just seen, some of these functions cannot\nwork over anon (RingCT) transactions—its privacy is still one of its most\nimportant selling points and development priorities. \n\nWhen debating whether or not PART should be private-by-default, are we asking\nthe right question? Is the entire debate misdirected?\n\nAt its most fundamental level, this debate seeks to find out whether or not\nPART’s current privacy capabilities are good enough to keep people anonymous.\nWhether or not PART mandates RingCT transactions or not is irrelevant as long as\nthe user privacy is solid enough. \n\nIs Particl private-by-default?\nLet’s first clear this question out of the way. No, Particl isn’t\n“private-by-default”, but it is heavily focused on anonymity nonetheless.\n\nKeep in mind, Particl’s mission is first and foremost to provide an ecosystem of\napplications that respect your rights. The race to the top for the absolute most\nprivate cryptocurrency in the space is not our primary focus and purpose. That\nbeing said, PART absolutely qualifies for a spot within the top privacy coins as\nwe are just about to find out.\n\nKeeping our mission in mind, PART is not dedicated exclusively to privacy\nmaximalists but also to a much wider range of audiences that also include people\nthat may not care as much about this specific aspect but more about others, like\ncutting off the middleman from their e-commerce operations, for example.\n\nBut is opt-in privacy, rather than mandated, an actual threat to the quality of\nthat privacy? Let’s see how RingCT works in the first place so that we may be\nable to answer that question after.\n\nHow Does RingCT Work?\nRingCT [https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf] is a combination of the \nConfidential Transactions (CT) [https://blockstream.com/bitcoin17-final41.pdf] \nand Ring Signature privacy protocols. CT keeps transacting amounts private and\nring signatures keep the identity of the participants private.\n\nWhenever you make an anon transaction, the transacting anon outputs are pooled\nup with other anon outputs on the network (ring signatures). These other outputs\npose as \"fake transaction participants\" and merely serve the role of being\nplausibly deniable decoys to hide amongst.\n\nFor an outside party looking into the transaction, it is theoretically not\npossible to tell, with certainty, which of the “participants” actually\nparticipated in the transaction, meaning that neither the value of the amount\ntransferred nor its participants can be traced. And while academic and\ntheoretical attack vectors do exist, as in every privacy protocol, RingCT has\nproven time and time again to be one of the most robust out there.\n\nWhat Contributes to Greater Privacy?\nTo keep things simple, more anon transactions on the network mean more privacy,\nand that privacy gets even better when there’s a constant flow of new legitimate\ntransactions being created. But let's break that down in more detail.\n\nHow private a transaction is, at the protocol level, mainly depends on two\nfactors. On one end, the sender of an anon transaction can increase or decrease\nthe level of its privacy by using a greater or lesser number of \"ring\nsignatures\". More ring signatures means more decoys participating in a\ntransaction and thus, in simple terms, greater expected privacy.\n\nOn the other end, the total number and diversity of these decoys matter greatly.\nBecause RingCT's privacy is obtained by hiding among decoys, its effectiveness\nincreases when there are more of them, and more of them coming from different\nsources, to pick from.\n\nTo understand this better, imagine that you are the sender of an anon\ntransaction that contains 8 ring signatures. Out of these, 2 of them are real\nparticipants (the sender and the receiver) and 6 of them are decoys. If the\nidentity of 4 of these decoys is known to an outside observer (i.e, an exchange,\na blockchain tracing company, etc), that really only leaves you with 2 decoys to\nhide among, making it easier, in theory, for the real participants to be\nidentified. \n\nThat's why having a large number of outputs and transactions on the network\nimproves your privacy. It gives the protocol more decoys to work with, and more\ndiverse ones, effectively reducing your chances of picking up compromised ones.\n\nOn the topic of the diversity in the source of these outputs, it is also very\nimportant as it reduces the chances of picking up decoys known to third-parties\ncollecting data on large numbers of outputs from a single source (i.e., an\nexchange keeping tabs on all the Monero outputs of its users). Note that this\nbecomes a much bigger problem if and when these parties start collaborating\ntogether and sharing their collected data with each other.\n\nOpt-in Privacy and the Human Factor\nAt the protocol level, RingCT's privacy isn't directly affected by whether or\nnot it is mandated or the default transaction type of the blockchain.\n\nIf, for example, Particl’s RingCT layer had a similar number of transactions per\nday as Monero, it would have a somewhat comparable level of privacy at the\nprotocol level. But, in practice, it gets a bit more complicated because, as\nmentioned earlier in this article, everything has trade-offs.\n\nIn the case of opt-in privacy, the trade-off is the human factor. Having the\nability to switch back and forth between public and anon balances opens the door\nto human errors and sub-optimal protocol usage. As with all cryptocurrencies,\nincluding private-by-default assets like Monero, there are some considerations\nand best practices to keep in mind to maintain a good level of privacy. \n\n> Note: The risks typically associated with the human factor are mostly applicable\nto normal peer-to-peer anon transactions between two users. Using Particl\napplications, like the marketplace, significantly reduces the risk of human\nerror by automatically applying some of the recommended best practices.\nLeveraging Particl Applications to Boost Privacy\nAs previously mentioned, the Particl project is much, much more than just a\ncryptocurrency. It's an ecosystem of distributed apps that respect your rights,\nwith one of these rights being the right to privacy. And that's precisely where\nlies Particl's mind-blowing privacy potential; in its apps!\n\nTo understand why that is, let’s take the Particl Marketplace app as an example\nonce again. It lets you buy and sell anything online with no restriction. It is\nprivate by default, meaning that all payments for goods and services have to use\nRingCT. For sellers, there's the option to pay for their listing fees (listing\nan item for sale on the marketplace) using anon transactions. \n\nAnd thus, each item listed on the marketplace generates at least one\ntransaction, meaning that a seller who wants to list 100 items will generate 100\nunique anon transactions alone plus two other anon transactions per sale (as\nboth the buyer and the seller have to make an anon transaction to complete the\nescrow private smart-contract).\n\nAs is self-evident, simple usage of the Particl apps like the marketplace\ndramatically scales the number of real, \"high-quality\" anon transactions per day\non the network up. To get an idea, simply think of how many e-commerce\ntransactions happen every day on the web. How many items are listed online.\nSure, that's an unfairly large segment to compare Particl to, but just think of\nhow many transactions happen just within the still-very-niche decentralized\nmarketplace segment (i.e., OpenSea). \n\n> \"To hide the signal, you must generate noise\" - Kewde, Particl developer\nAs a reference, Monero does around a solid 16,000 transactions per day at the\ntime of writing this piece. Could usage of Particl Marketplace generate similar\nnumbers? The jury is still out but one can speculate.\n\nAnd the cherry on top? Particl Marketplace, and all future Particl applications\nlike the upcoming BasicSwap DEX, is entirely decentralized and trustless.\nThere's no central party able to collect any data about you, your anon outputs,\nor those of other participants on the network; a very unique advantage of\nParticl over other privacy coins.\n\nIn other words, using Particl applications not only increases the number of anon\ntransactions and outputs on the network, but it also does so in a way that\nimproves the quality and effectiveness of available decoys. As current and\nfuture Particl applications gain more adoption, so does the the level of\non-chain privacy as well.\n\nNew Privacy Boons Abound\nParticl is fortunate to be built on the Bitcoin codebase. Indeed, contrary to\nwhat many think, the Bitcoin codebase is evolving rapidly and is going through a\nparticularly innovative phase. That is especially true of recent progress made\non the Lightning Network and Taproot, both of which innovations are available on\nParticl and enhanced by an extra RingCT bridge for added anonymity.\n\nNot mandating RingCT transactions gives us the ability to leverage and combine\nthese breakthrough developments from the Bitcoin community to massively improve\nParticl's privacy and make its applications better for all. \n\nComplex and Private LN-based Smart-Contracts\nIndeed, recent developments have made it possible to run complex smart-contracts\non the Lightning Network. These smart-contracts can even be deployed using CT to\nkeep the amounts transferred confidential. This is a significant development for\nthe Bitcoin community as it dramatically improves your privacy and opens the\ncoin up to even more use-cases. But there is a small caveat; blinded\nsmart-contracts don't hide the identities of people using them; only the\ntransacted amounts remain confidential.\n\nIf that smart-contract was powering the escrow of some hypothetical marketplace,\nit could be possible to tell the identity of the seller and the buyer of a given\ntransaction. On Particl, the additional layer of RingCT would keep both the\nbuyer and the seller private by letting them enter and exit the Lightning\nNetwork without leaving a trace. \n\nTaproot Scripts\nWith Taproot now being enabled on Particl, new on-chain scripting options have\nbecome available. Taproot enables more advanced, but also more private, complex\ntransactions by combining multiple keys and signatures into one. With it, you\ncan pre-emptively program payments within a group of people and trigger them\nfollowing a set of pre-defined conditions. The resulting transactions look just\nlike any other regular transaction on the blockchain and neither the conditions\nnor the identities of the participants are exposed.\n\nThis opens a ton of opportunities, like for example entering and exiting the\nLightning Network more privately\n[https://learningblocks.io/taproot-and-the-lightning-network-a-match-made-in-heaven/]\n, making Particl's treasury entirely decentralized, making BasicSwap DEX swaps\nwith Bitcoin-based currencies look just like a normal transaction, or even \nmaking some core components of Particl quantum-proof\n[https://youtu.be/gF4Mkkhyz1Q?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61KHzhg3JIJdK08JLSlcLId&t=4291].\nAnd that's just to name a few of the possibilites... \n\n> Note: In both the cases of LN and Taproot, it's important to note that RingCT\ntransactions are not directly merged with LN and taproot, but rather run upon\nentering and exiting the L2 network to break the history.\nSo, Should PART Become Private-by-Default?\nUltimately, there is no right or wrong answer to this debate. With both options,\nthere are pros, cons, and trade-offs. There is no perfect solution; it all\ndepends on the purpose of a specific cryptocurrency and the mission it’s trying\nto accomplish. However, we are highly confident that Particl's current privacy\nsetup strikes the optimal utility/privacy balance for what it seeks to\naccomplish and for who it seeks to accomplish it for. \n\nAnd although PART can be said to be less private than competing privacy coins\nsuch as Monero, an obvious statement considering the difference in the number of\ntransactions between the two networks at this present time, its privacy\npotential is just as solid, if not even better, assuming decent usage of\nParticl's distributed applications and that best practices are followed by\nusers.\n\nPART's public addresses provide a lot of capabilities that are key to Particl's\necosystem and they cannot be readily dismissed. For this reason, and for the\nother reasons mentioned earlier in the blog post, the Particl team does not plan\nto switch to an exclusively private-by-default model of transactional privacy in\nthe foreseeable future. We want to reiterate our strong confidence in our\ncurrent model and are focusing on building applications that will organically\nraise the diversity and number of anon transactions and outputs on the network.\n\nThat being said, we remain open to adjusting our position on this matter in the\nfuture depending on how things evolve.\n\nParticl Desktop Privacy Improvements on the Way!\nThe fact that we embrace an opt-in privacy setup doesn't mean we can't work\ntowards reducing potential mistakes caused by the human factor. \n\nAs such, Particl Core contains a few improvements in the RingCT implementation\nthat mitigate some of the risks introduced by the opt-in nature of PART's\nprivacy setup. \n\nAlso, in the next few Particl Desktop updates, you can expect new\nprivacy-focused UI additions and improvements that seek to reduce the risk of\nhuman errors to a minimum. For example, a simple \"churning function\" that\nautomatically churns your anon outputs (generates privacy-enhancing transactions\n(send-to-self) and creates more noise to hide within) to improve your privacy\nand everyone else's as well. Stay tuned to our weekly development updates\n[https://particl.news/tag/progress/] for more information.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSynergy and Collaboration, not Tribalism and Exclusion\nParticl's purpose is to build an ecosystem of apps that respect your rights and\nis as inclusive as possible. The race to the top for the most private features\non a cryptocurrency is something we keep in mind without prime focus, although\nwe fully believe PART can eventually become as such once the adoption of the\nParticl platform grows.\n\nAs part of this vision, we are working on a cross-chain and private\ndecentralized trading exchange (BasicSwap DEX) that lets you swap different\ncryptocurrencies without the use of any third-party.\n\nThat means you can easily enter and exit the Particl ecosystem using your\nfavorite privacy coin such as Monero, for example, and enjoy the benefits of\nboth chains at the same time. \n\nBy combining Monero's private-by-default currency-focused approach and Particl's\napp-focused vision, you can reach strong levels of privacy few people thought\nwere possible. The trade-offs of using an opt-in privacy coin (Particl) can then\nbe offset by using an opt-out one (Monero) on the platform, just like Monero can\noffset its trade-offs (lack of distributed apps and more rigidity) by bridging\ninto the Particl ecosystem using BasicSwap. A win-win situation for both\nblockchains and a major victory for the people.\n\nOnce the DEX is integrated into Particl desktop client, Particl Desktop, the\nsynergy it creates with other privacy coins will take the entire privacy\nenthusiast community to the next level. You'll be able to use distributed and\nprivate applications without making any security or privacy compromise and by\nusing your favorite coin.\n\nIndeed, synergy, not tribalism, is how we see the privacy coin space evolving to\nthe direct benefit of the people. There are many different approaches to privacy\nand it’s difficult to say which one is the best because, in part, use-cases and\ntarget audiences differ so much. And so, why not combine different options and\nwork in unison towards bringing more privacy to the average joe? That's what we\nset out to do with Particl, and what we'll keep giving our blood, sweat, and\ntears to day after day!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJoin the discussion\nWhat's your stance?

Indeed, leveraging the Bitcoin codebase enables PART to benefit from the sheer strength of the entire Bitcoin ecosystem and developer community. That means more developers auditing and contributing to the code (Taproot, LN, etc), more stability, and more products and releases to benefit from (Copay, Electrum, etc). But perhaps more importantly, that also means much more flexibility.</p><p>And that’s where PART shines uniquely and really sets itself apart from other privacy coins. While it uses the proven-effective but typically rigid RingCT and CT protocols, it possesses all of Bitcoin's flexibility; massively expanding its utility as more than just a private currency. </p><p>This added flexibility makes it possible to use the coin in simple Bitcoin-style smart-contracts and multi-signature contracts. But don’t get fooled by the word “basic”, what can be done with “simple smart-contracts” is pretty astonishing in itself as demonstrated by distributed apps like <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</a> (decentralized e-commerce) and the recent Taproot developments. More on that shortly.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-part-s-real-intended-purpose\">What is PART’s Real Intended Purpose?</h3><p>When we, the Particl team, first envisioned and designed the Particl project, we had a very clear mission in mind: building an ecosystem of distributed applications that respect your rights and freedoms. This is our primary focus and all further design decisions follow that guiding line.</p><p>We are building these applications for everyone—freedom seekers, the persecuted and censored, big and small online sellers, online shoppers, the “typical internet user”, and, among many other types of people, privacy enthusiasts too.</p><p>In that sense, building a privacy coin that only serves as a medium of exchange isn’t our objective. PART is a multi-purpose, privacy-focused currency that is more akin to a tool than only a currency. By design, it needs to be flexible enough to accomplish various functions within the Particl ecosystem, which is achieved by leveraging the benefits of the Bitcoin codebase.</p><p>It is with this need for both multi-purpose flexibility and privacy that we’ve designed PART’s privacy setup and why we’re confident that it’s doing exactly what we intended it to do in the first place.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-particl-distributed-apps\">What are Particl Distributed Apps</h2><p>To give you a better idea of our vision, let's take one of the distributed applications of the Particl ecosystem. Particl Marketplace is a decentralized and private-by-default online marketplace that lets you buy and sell anything online with no restriction. Think of it like an eBay, but without any middleman, data mining, restriction, or sales fee/commission.</p><p>This marketplace is made possible thanks to many pieces fitting together: the flexibility of the Bitcoin smart-contracts, the use of a custom and unique P2P messaging layer (SMSG), the privacy benefits of the RingCT protocol, a distributed governance system, the anonymity of the Tor network, and the smart-contract capabilities of the Bitcoin-based CT protocol.</p><p>As PART itself directly powers some of these functions (i.e., content moderation), its multi-purpose nature becomes clearer. And as some of these functions cannot work using anon balances and transactions, the debate on whether we should mandate private transactions or not suddenly becomes more nuanced.</p><h2 id=\"the-need-for-public-balances\">The Need for Public Balances</h2><p>RingCT transactions are, by design, quite rigid as their outputs are not programmable. This prevents anon balances to be used in more complex scenarios, on various platforms, and for certain use-cases. To circumvent this limitation, Particl leverages both public (Bitcoin-like) and <a href=\"https://blockstream.com/bitcoin17-final41.pdf\">CT transactions</a>. This “protocol flexibility” is one of the coin’s most important strengths and expands its utility beyond what it could be if it was working exclusively using RingCT.</p><h3 id=\"what-are-public-balances-used-for\">What are Public Balances Used for?</h3><p>At this time, here’s a list of some components of the Particl ecosystem that require public balances to function:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Particl Proof-of-Stake (PPoS)</strong> consensus mechanism, including cold staking and cold staking pools. There is, however, an option to receive all staking rewards using RingCT or CT transactions for those looking for that extra layer of privacy. To learn more about how to do this, please refer to <a href=\"https://particl.news/private-cold-staking-script-released-d8900e193490/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>this article</strong></a>.</li><li>Particl's <strong>decentralized treasury</strong> which funds community initiatives.</li><li>The <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>community governance system</strong></a> which allows stakeholders to vote on important decisions with their stake weight.</li><li>The <strong>Particl Marketplace</strong> <strong>community moderation system</strong> which lets the users moderate undesirable content off of the marketplace and fight off spam on the platform.</li><li>The <strong>mobile wallet Particl Copay</strong>.</li><li>The <strong>light wallet Particl Electrum</strong> (desktop and mobile) which is expected to power future mobile and web releases.</li><li><strong>Hardware devices</strong> such as the Ledger Nano S and the Trezor.</li></ul><p>And, although Particl Marketplace’s <a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_escrow.html\">two-party escrow system</a> doesn’t rely on public transactions, it still requires CT transactions to link RingCT outputs together to provide its anonymity. You can read more on how this is done by checking out <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>this article</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>As you can see, many critical components of the Particl ecosystem entirely rely on public balances and transactions. Making PART private-by-default or outright mandating private transactions would cause a significant setback and even force the project to abandon some of its core components. This would go in direct opposition of our mission.</p><h3 id=\"what-about-exchanges\">What About Exchanges?</h3><p>Another downside associated with having a private-by-default cryptocurrency has to do with the ever-evolving legal landscape of the blockchain industry. As is becoming more evident by the day, regulations are tightening, notably around the use of “privacy coins”. As a result, a lot of leading exchanges have resorted to delisting and/or not entertaining adding privacy coins as a way to protect themselves and ensure that they remain compliant.</p><p>With Particl’s relatively precarious presence on exchanges, having the main transaction type be transparent is a definite upside.</p><p>And even though exchanges could, in theory, change the type of transactions they accept if Particl were to switch to a private-by-default model, they may not be inclined to do so purely based on the fact that PART itself has relatively low liquidity and volume. The effort involved with implementing that change at the exchange level, coupled with the legal uncertainty of accepting privacy coins, may simply not be worth it for exchanges. This could lead to a delisting and reduction of accessibility to the PART coin; something that cannot be neglected as the coin needs to be as accessible as possible for Particl to accomplish its mission.</p><h3 id=\"auditing-the-circulating-supply\">Auditing the Circulating Supply</h3><p>Everything in life has trade-offs. With cryptocurrencies that mandate private transactions like Monero, the added privacy is counter-balanced by the fact that the circulating supply cannot be properly audited with full certainty.

As the Monero team best wrote it: <em>“(…) the use of transparent fund migration means that an attempt to move enough exploited funds through the transparent Zcash pool could be detected (…)”</em>. On that note, we highly recommend reading <a href=\"https://www.getmonero.org/2020/01/17/auditability.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>Monero’s well-thought-out response on the topic of supply auditability</strong></a>, how it relates to private (“opaque”) cryptocurrencies, and the trade-offs involved with this.</p><p>In our particular case, supply auditability isn’t the main reason why we’ve opted against mandating private transactions, but it’s certainly an appreciable benefit.</p><h3 id=\"transaction-speed\">Transaction Speed</h3><p>One non-negligible benefit of having public balances is the faster speed of transaction settlements on Particl.

CT keeps transacting amounts private and ring signatures keep the identity of the participants private.</p><p>Whenever you make an anon transaction, the transacting anon outputs are pooled up with other anon outputs on the network (ring signatures). These other outputs pose as \"fake transaction participants\" and merely serve the role of being plausibly deniable decoys to hide amongst.</p><p>For an outside party looking into the transaction, it is theoretically not possible to tell, with certainty, which of the “participants” actually participated in the transaction, meaning that neither the value of the amount transferred nor its participants can be traced. And while academic and theoretical attack vectors do exist, as in every privacy protocol, RingCT has proven time and time again to be one of the most robust out there.</p><h3 id=\"what-contributes-to-greater-privacy\">What Contributes to Greater Privacy?</h3><p>To keep things simple, more anon transactions on the network mean more privacy, and that privacy gets even better when there’s a constant flow of new legitimate transactions being created. But let's break that down in more detail.</p><p>How private a transaction is, at the protocol level, mainly depends on two factors. On one end, the sender of an anon transaction can increase or decrease the level of its privacy by using a greater or lesser number of \"ring signatures\". More ring signatures means more decoys participating in a transaction and thus, in simple terms, greater expected privacy.</p><p>On the other end, the total number and diversity of these decoys matter greatly. Because RingCT's privacy is obtained by hiding among decoys, its effectiveness increases when there are more of them, and more of them coming from different sources, to pick from.</p><p>To understand this better, imagine that you are the sender of an anon transaction that contains 8 ring signatures. Out of these, 2 of them are real participants (the sender and the receiver) and 6 of them are decoys. If the identity of 4 of these decoys is known to an outside observer (i.e, an exchange, a blockchain tracing company, etc), that really only leaves you with 2 decoys to hide among, making it easier, in theory, for the real participants to be identified. </p><p>That's why having a large number of outputs and transactions on the network improves your privacy. It gives the protocol more decoys to work with, and more diverse ones, effectively reducing your chances of picking up compromised ones.</p><p>On the topic of the diversity in the source of these outputs, it is also very important as it reduces the chances of picking up decoys known to third-parties collecting data on large numbers of outputs from a single source (i.e., an exchange keeping tabs on all the Monero outputs of its users). Note that this becomes a much bigger problem if and when these parties start collaborating together and sharing their collected data with each other.</p><h3 id=\"opt-in-privacy-and-the-human-factor\">Opt-in Privacy and the Human Factor</h3><p>At the protocol level, RingCT's privacy isn't directly affected by whether or not it is mandated or the default transaction type of the blockchain.</p><p>If, for example, Particl’s RingCT layer had a similar number of transactions per day as Monero, it would have a somewhat comparable level of privacy <strong>at the protocol level</strong>. But, in practice, it gets a bit more complicated because, as mentioned earlier in this article, everything has trade-offs.</p><p>In the case of opt-in privacy, the trade-off is the human factor. Having the ability to switch back and forth between public and anon balances opens the door to human errors and sub-optimal protocol usage. As with all cryptocurrencies, including private-by-default assets like Monero, there are some considerations and best practices to keep in mind to maintain a good level of privacy. </p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> The risks typically associated with the human factor are mostly applicable to normal peer-to-peer anon transactions between two users. Using Particl applications, like the marketplace, significantly reduces the risk of human error by automatically applying some of the recommended best practices.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"leveraging-particl-applications-to-boost-privacy\">Leveraging Particl Applications to Boost Privacy</h2><p>As previously mentioned, the Particl project is much, much more than just a cryptocurrency. It's an ecosystem of distributed apps that respect your rights, with one of these rights being the right to privacy. And that's precisely where lies Particl's mind-blowing privacy potential; in its apps!</p><p>To understand why that is, let’s take the Particl Marketplace app as an example once again. It lets you buy and sell anything online with no restriction. It is private by default, meaning that all payments for goods and services have to use RingCT. For sellers, there's the option to pay for their listing fees (listing an item for sale on the marketplace) using anon transactions. </p><p>And thus, each item listed on the marketplace generates at least one transaction, meaning that a seller who wants to list 100 items will generate 100 unique anon transactions alone plus two other anon transactions per sale (as both the buyer and the seller have to make an anon transaction to complete the escrow private smart-contract).</p><p>As is self-evident, simple usage of the Particl apps like the marketplace dramatically scales the number of real, \"high-quality\" anon transactions per day on the network up. To get an idea, simply think of how many e-commerce transactions happen every day on the web. How many items are listed online. Sure, that's an unfairly large segment to compare Particl to, but just think of how many transactions happen just within the still-very-niche decentralized marketplace segment (i.e., OpenSea). </p><blockquote><em>\"To hide the signal, you must generate noise\"</em> - Kewde, Particl developer</blockquote><p>As a reference, Monero does around a solid 16,000 transactions per day at the time of writing this piece. Could usage of Particl Marketplace generate similar numbers? The jury is still out but one can speculate.</p><p>And the cherry on top? Particl Marketplace, and all future Particl applications like the upcoming BasicSwap DEX, is entirely decentralized and trustless. There's no central party able to collect any data about you, your anon outputs, or those of other participants on the network; a very unique advantage of Particl over other privacy coins.</p><p>In other words, using Particl applications not only increases the number of anon transactions and outputs on the network, but it also does so in a way that improves the quality and effectiveness of available decoys. As current and future Particl applications gain more adoption, so does the the level of on-chain privacy as well.</p><h2 id=\"new-privacy-boons-abound\">New Privacy Boons Abound</h2><p>Particl is fortunate to be built on the Bitcoin codebase. Indeed, contrary to what many think, the Bitcoin codebase is evolving rapidly and is going through a particularly innovative phase. That is especially true of recent progress made on the Lightning Network and Taproot, both of which innovations are available on Particl and enhanced by an extra RingCT bridge for added anonymity.</p><p>Not mandating RingCT transactions gives us the ability to leverage and combine these breakthrough developments from the Bitcoin community to massively improve Particl's privacy and make its applications better for all. </p><p><strong>Complex and Private LN-based Smart-Contracts</strong><br>Indeed, recent developments have made it possible to run complex smart-contracts on the Lightning Network. These smart-contracts can even be deployed using CT to keep the amounts transferred confidential. This is a significant development for the Bitcoin community as it dramatically improves your privacy and opens the coin up to even more use-cases. But there is a small caveat; blinded smart-contracts don't hide the identities of people using them; only the transacted amounts remain confidential.</p><p>If that smart-contract was powering the escrow of some hypothetical marketplace, it could be possible to tell the identity of the seller and the buyer of a given transaction. On Particl, the additional layer of RingCT would keep both the buyer and the seller private by letting them enter and exit the Lightning Network without leaving a trace. </p><p><strong>Taproot Scripts</strong><br>With Taproot now being enabled on Particl, new on-chain scripting options have become available. Taproot enables more advanced, but also more private, complex transactions by combining multiple keys and signatures into one. With it, you can pre-emptively program payments within a group of people and trigger them following a set of pre-defined conditions. The resulting transactions look just like any other regular transaction on the blockchain and neither the conditions nor the identities of the participants are exposed.  </p><p>This opens a ton of opportunities, like for example <a href=\"https://learningblocks.io/taproot-and-the-lightning-network-a-match-made-in-heaven/\">entering and exiting the Lightning Network more privately</a>, making Particl's treasury entirely decentralized, making BasicSwap DEX swaps with Bitcoin-based currencies look just like a normal transaction, or even <a href=\"https://youtu.be/gF4Mkkhyz1Q?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61KHzhg3JIJdK08JLSlcLId&amp;t=4291\">making some core components of Particl quantum-proof</a>. And that's just to name a few of the possibilites... </p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> In both the cases of LN and Taproot, it's important to note that RingCT transactions are not directly merged with LN and taproot, but rather run upon entering and exiting the L2 network to break the history.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"so-should-part-become-private-by-default\">So, Should PART Become Private-by-Default?</h2><p>Ultimately, there is no right or wrong answer to this debate. With both options, there are pros, cons, and trade-offs. There is no perfect solution; it all depends on the purpose of a specific cryptocurrency and the mission it’s trying to accomplish. However, we are highly confident that Particl's current privacy setup strikes the optimal utility/privacy balance for what it seeks to accomplish and for who it seeks to accomplish it for. </p><p>And although PART can be said to be less private than competing privacy coins such as Monero, an obvious statement considering the difference in the number of transactions between the two networks <strong>at this present time</strong>, its privacy potential is just as solid, if not even better, assuming decent usage of Particl's distributed applications and that best practices are followed by users.</p><p>PART's public addresses provide a lot of capabilities that are key to Particl's ecosystem and they cannot be readily dismissed. For this reason, and for the other reasons mentioned earlier in the blog post, <strong>the Particl team does not plan to switch to an exclusively private-by-default model of transactional privacy in the foreseeable future</strong>. We want to reiterate our strong confidence in our current model and are focusing on building applications that will organically raise the diversity and number of anon transactions and outputs on the network.</p><p>That being said, we remain open to adjusting our position on this matter in the future depending on how things evolve.</p><h2 id=\"particl-desktop-privacy-improvements-on-the-way-\">Particl Desktop Privacy Improvements on the Way!</h2><p>The fact that we embrace an opt-in privacy setup doesn't mean we can't work towards reducing potential mistakes caused by the human factor. </p><p>As such, Particl Core contains a few improvements in the RingCT implementation that mitigate some of the risks introduced by the opt-in nature of PART's privacy setup. </p><p>Also, <strong>in the next few Particl Desktop updates</strong>, you can expect new privacy-focused UI additions and improvements that seek to reduce the risk of human errors to a minimum. For example, a simple \"churning function\" that automatically churns your anon outputs (generates privacy-enhancing transactions (send-to-self) and creates more noise to hide within) to improve your privacy and everyone else's as well. Stay tuned to our <a href=\"https://particl.news/tag/progress/\"><strong>weekly development updates</strong></a> for more information.</p><hr><h2 id=\"synergy-and-collaboration-not-tribalism-and-exclusion\">Synergy and Collaboration, not Tribalism and Exclusion</h2><p>Particl's purpose is to build an ecosystem of apps that respect your rights and is as inclusive as possible. The race to the top for the most private features on a cryptocurrency is something we keep in mind without prime focus, although we fully believe PART can eventually become as such once the adoption of the Particl platform grows.</p><p>As part of this vision, we are working on a cross-chain and private decentralized trading exchange (BasicSwap DEX) that lets you swap different cryptocurrencies without the use of any third-party.</p><p>That means you can easily enter and exit the Particl ecosystem using your favorite privacy coin such as Monero, for example, and enjoy the benefits of both chains at the same time. </p><p>By combining Monero's private-by-default currency-focused approach and Particl's app-focused vision, you can reach strong levels of privacy few people thought were possible. The trade-offs of using an opt-in privacy coin (Particl) can then be offset by using an opt-out one (Monero) on the platform, just like Monero can offset its trade-offs (lack of distributed apps and more rigidity) by bridging into the Particl ecosystem using BasicSwap. A win-win situation for both blockchains and a major victory for the people.</p><p>Once the DEX is integrated into Particl desktop client, Particl Desktop, the synergy it creates with other privacy coins will take the entire privacy enthusiast community to the next level. You'll be able to use distributed and private applications without making any security or privacy compromise and by using your favorite coin.</p><p>Indeed, synergy, not tribalism, is how we see the privacy coin space evolving to the direct benefit of the people. There are many different approaches to privacy and it’s difficult to say which one is the best because, in part, use-cases and target audiences differ so much. And so, why not combine different options and work in unison towards bringing more privacy to the average joe? That's what we set out to do with Particl, and what we'll keep giving our blood, sweat, and tears to day after day!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr>\n<h3 id=\"join-the-discussion\">Join the discussion</h3>\n<p>What's your stance?

As you can imagine, this topic can rapidly lead to fiery debates on the level of privacy certain protocol implementations offer and as to why a certain currency was designed the way it is.</p><p>We’d like, today, to clarify our position on this topic and detail why we’ve decided to follow this particular path.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> In this article, we often refer to RingCT transactions as “anon transactions\". These are used as synonyms.</em></blockquote><h3 id=\"table-of-contents\">Table of Contents</h3><ul><li><a href=\"#about-particl-s-native-currency-part\">About Particl's Native Currency; PART</a></li><li><a href=\"#what-are-particl-distributed-apps\">What are Particl Distributed Apps</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-need-for-public-balances\">The Need for Public Balances</a></li><li><a href=\"#about-part-s-privacy\">About Particl’s Privacy</a></li><li><a href=\"#how-does-ringct-work\">How Does RingCT Work?</a></li><li><a href=\"#leveraging-particl-applications-to-boost-privacy\">Leveraging Particl Applications to Boost Privacy</a></li><li><a href=\"#new-privacy-boons-abound\">New Privacy Boons Abound</a></li><li><a href=\"#so-should-part-become-private-by-default\">So, Should PART Become Private-by-Default?</a></li><li><a href=\"#particl-desktop-privacy-improvements-on-the-way-\">Particl Desktop Privacy Improvements on the Way!</a></li><li><a href=\"#synergy-and-collaboration-not-tribalism-and-exclusion\">Synergy and Collaboration, not Tribalism and Exclusion</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id=\"about-particl-s-native-currency-part\">About Particl’s Native Currency; PART</h2><p>Before we get into the nitty-gritty details as to why PART uses an opt-in privacy setup rather than mandating all transactions to be private, it’s important to understand the context of PART's existence and know what is its purpose within the wider Particl ecosystem.</p><p>Taken at face value, PART is a proof-of-stake privacy coin that uses the same privacy protocol as Monero (RingCT) but uses the Bitcoin codebase instead of the more rigid Cryptonote one.</p><p>This difference in codebases makes a world of differences. Indeed, leveraging the Bitcoin codebase enables PART to benefit from the sheer strength of the entire Bitcoin ecosystem and developer community. That means more developers auditing and contributing to the code (Taproot, LN, etc), more stability, and more products and releases to benefit from (Copay, Electrum, etc). But perhaps more importantly, that also means much more flexibility.</p><p>And that’s where PART shines uniquely and really sets itself apart from other privacy coins. While it uses the proven-effective but typically rigid RingCT and CT protocols, it possesses all of Bitcoin's flexibility; massively expanding its utility as more than just a private currency. </p><p>This added flexibility makes it possible to use the coin in simple Bitcoin-style smart-contracts and multi-signature contracts. But don’t get fooled by the word “basic”, what can be done with “simple smart-contracts” is pretty astonishing in itself as demonstrated by distributed apps like <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</a> (decentralized e-commerce) and the recent Taproot developments. More on that shortly.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-part-s-real-intended-purpose\">What is PART’s Real Intended Purpose?</h3><p>When we, the Particl team, first envisioned and designed the Particl project, we had a very clear mission in mind: building an ecosystem of distributed applications that respect your rights and freedoms. This is our primary focus and all further design decisions follow that guiding line.</p><p>We are building these applications for everyone—freedom seekers, the persecuted and censored, big and small online sellers, online shoppers, the “typical internet user”, and, among many other types of people, privacy enthusiasts too.</p><p>In that sense, building a privacy coin that only serves as a medium of exchange isn’t our objective. PART is a multi-purpose, privacy-focused currency that is more akin to a tool than only a currency. By design, it needs to be flexible enough to accomplish various functions within the Particl ecosystem, which is achieved by leveraging the benefits of the Bitcoin codebase.</p><p>It is with this need for both multi-purpose flexibility and privacy that we’ve designed PART’s privacy setup and why we’re confident that it’s doing exactly what we intended it to do in the first place.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-particl-distributed-apps\">What are Particl Distributed Apps</h2><p>To give you a better idea of our vision, let's take one of the distributed applications of the Particl ecosystem. Particl Marketplace is a decentralized and private-by-default online marketplace that lets you buy and sell anything online with no restriction. Think of it like an eBay, but without any middleman, data mining, restriction, or sales fee/commission.</p><p>This marketplace is made possible thanks to many pieces fitting together: the flexibility of the Bitcoin smart-contracts, the use of a custom and unique P2P messaging layer (SMSG), the privacy benefits of the RingCT protocol, a distributed governance system, the anonymity of the Tor network, and the smart-contract capabilities of the Bitcoin-based CT protocol.</p><p>As PART itself directly powers some of these functions (i.e., content moderation), its multi-purpose nature becomes clearer. And as some of these functions cannot work using anon balances and transactions, the debate on whether we should mandate private transactions or not suddenly becomes more nuanced.</p><h2 id=\"the-need-for-public-balances\">The Need for Public Balances</h2><p>RingCT transactions are, by design, quite rigid as their outputs are not programmable. This prevents anon balances to be used in more complex scenarios, on various platforms, and for certain use-cases. To circumvent this limitation, Particl leverages both public (Bitcoin-like) and <a href=\"https://blockstream.com/bitcoin17-final41.pdf\">CT transactions</a>. This “protocol flexibility” is one of the coin’s most important strengths and expands its utility beyond what it could be if it was working exclusively using RingCT.</p><h3 id=\"what-are-public-balances-used-for\">What are Public Balances Used for?</h3><p>At this time, here’s a list of some components of the Particl ecosystem that require public balances to function:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Particl Proof-of-Stake (PPoS)</strong> consensus mechanism, including cold staking and cold staking pools. There is, however, an option to receive all staking rewards using RingCT or CT transactions for those looking for that extra layer of privacy. To learn more about how to do this, please refer to <a href=\"https://particl.news/private-cold-staking-script-released-d8900e193490/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>this article</strong></a>.</li><li>Particl's <strong>decentralized treasury</strong> which funds community initiatives.</li><li>The <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>community governance system</strong></a> which allows stakeholders to vote on important decisions with their stake weight.</li><li>The <strong>Particl Marketplace</strong> <strong>community moderation system</strong> which lets the users moderate undesirable content off of the marketplace and fight off spam on the platform.</li><li>The <strong>mobile wallet Particl Copay</strong>.</li><li>The <strong>light wallet Particl Electrum</strong> (desktop and mobile) which is expected to power future mobile and web releases.</li><li><strong>Hardware devices</strong> such as the Ledger Nano S and the Trezor.</li></ul><p>And, although Particl Marketplace’s <a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_escrow.html\">two-party escrow system</a> doesn’t rely on public transactions, it still requires CT transactions to link RingCT outputs together to provide its anonymity. You can read more on how this is done by checking out <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>this article</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>As you can see, many critical components of the Particl ecosystem entirely rely on public balances and transactions. Making PART private-by-default or outright mandating private transactions would cause a significant setback and even force the project to abandon some of its core components. This would go in direct opposition of our mission.</p><h3 id=\"what-about-exchanges\">What About Exchanges?</h3><p>Another downside associated with having a private-by-default cryptocurrency has to do with the ever-evolving legal landscape of the blockchain industry. As is becoming more evident by the day, regulations are tightening, notably around the use of “privacy coins”. As a result, a lot of leading exchanges have resorted to delisting and/or not entertaining adding privacy coins as a way to protect themselves and ensure that they remain compliant.</p><p>With Particl’s relatively precarious presence on exchanges, having the main transaction type be transparent is a definite upside.</p><p>And even though exchanges could, in theory, change the type of transactions they accept if Particl were to switch to a private-by-default model, they may not be inclined to do so purely based on the fact that PART itself has relatively low liquidity and volume. The effort involved with implementing that change at the exchange level, coupled with the legal uncertainty of accepting privacy coins, may simply not be worth it for exchanges. This could lead to a delisting and reduction of accessibility to the PART coin; something that cannot be neglected as the coin needs to be as accessible as possible for Particl to accomplish its mission.</p><h3 id=\"auditing-the-circulating-supply\">Auditing the Circulating Supply</h3><p>Everything in life has trade-offs. With cryptocurrencies that mandate private transactions like Monero, the added privacy is counter-balanced by the fact that the circulating supply cannot be properly audited with full certainty. And although the reasons that may cause supply inflation are usually considered more theoretical than practical, they are real risks nonetheless.</p><p>By having public balances on which people hold funds and stake from, you can determine, with more accuracy, whether or not the total number of coins in circulation is as expected. As the Monero team best wrote it: <em>“(…) the use of transparent fund migration means that an attempt to move enough exploited funds through the transparent Zcash pool could be detected (…)”</em>. On that note, we highly recommend reading <a href=\"https://www.getmonero.org/2020/01/17/auditability.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>Monero’s well-thought-out response on the topic of supply auditability</strong></a>, how it relates to private (“opaque”) cryptocurrencies, and the trade-offs involved with this.</p><p>In our particular case, supply auditability isn’t the main reason why we’ve opted against mandating private transactions, but it’s certainly an appreciable benefit.</p><h3 id=\"transaction-speed\">Transaction Speed</h3><p>One non-negligible benefit of having public balances is the faster speed of transaction settlements on Particl. While both public and anon transactions use block confirmation times of 2 minutes, public balances are usable after 1 confirmation (~2 minutes) while anon balances can only be used once the funds it contains have reached 12 confirmations (~24 minutes).</p><p>This speed is handy in many situations and straight up required in others, notably in the context of certain Particl applications where the public balance holds a key role (i.e., moderating marketplace content).</p><hr><h2 id=\"about-part-s-privacy\">About PART’s Privacy</h2><p>Although PART is a multi-purpose coin that accomplishes different functions within the ecosystem—and, as we’ve just seen, some of these functions cannot work over anon (RingCT) transactions—its privacy is still one of its most important selling points and development priorities. </p><p>When debating whether or not PART should be private-by-default, are we asking the right question? Is the entire debate misdirected?</p><p>At its most fundamental level, this debate seeks to find out whether or not PART’s current privacy capabilities are good enough to keep people anonymous. Whether or not PART mandates RingCT transactions or not is irrelevant as long as the user privacy is solid enough. </p><h3 id=\"is-particl-private-by-default\">Is Particl private-by-default?</h3><p>Let’s first clear this question out of the way. No, Particl isn’t “private-by-default”, but it is heavily focused on anonymity nonetheless.</p><p>Keep in mind, <strong>Particl’s mission is first and foremost to provide an ecosystem of applications that respect your rights.</strong> The race to the top for the absolute most private cryptocurrency in the space is not our primary focus and purpose. That being said, PART absolutely qualifies for a spot within the top privacy coins as we are just about to find out.</p><p>Keeping our mission in mind, PART is not dedicated exclusively to privacy maximalists but also to a much wider range of audiences that also include people that may not care as much about this specific aspect but more about others, like cutting off the middleman from their e-commerce operations, for example.</p><p>But is opt-in privacy, rather than mandated, an actual threat to the quality of that privacy? Let’s see how RingCT works in the first place so that we may be able to answer that question after.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-ringct-work\">How Does RingCT Work?</h2><p><a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf\">RingCT</a> is a combination of the <a href=\"https://blockstream.com/bitcoin17-final41.pdf\">Confidential Transactions (CT)</a> and Ring Signature privacy protocols. CT keeps transacting amounts private and ring signatures keep the identity of the participants private.</p><p>Whenever you make an anon transaction, the transacting anon outputs are pooled up with other anon outputs on the network (ring signatures).

And while academic and theoretical attack vectors do exist, as in every privacy protocol, RingCT has proven time and time again to be one of the most robust out there.</p><h3 id=\"what-contributes-to-greater-privacy\">What Contributes to Greater Privacy?</h3><p>To keep things simple, more anon transactions on the network mean more privacy, and that privacy gets even better when there’s a constant flow of new legitimate transactions being created. But let's break that down in more detail.</p><p>How private a transaction is, at the protocol level, mainly depends on two factors. On one end, the sender of an anon transaction can increase or decrease the level of its privacy by using a greater or lesser number of \"ring signatures\". More ring signatures means more decoys participating in a transaction and thus, in simple terms, greater expected privacy.</p><p>On the other end, the total number and diversity of these decoys matter greatly. Because RingCT's privacy is obtained by hiding among decoys, its effectiveness increases when there are more of them, and more of them coming from different sources, to pick from.</p><p>To understand this better, imagine that you are the sender of an anon transaction that contains 8 ring signatures. Out of these, 2 of them are real participants (the sender and the receiver) and 6 of them are decoys. If the identity of 4 of these decoys is known to an outside observer (i.e, an exchange, a blockchain tracing company, etc), that really only leaves you with 2 decoys to hide among, making it easier, in theory, for the real participants to be identified. </p><p>That's why having a large number of outputs and transactions on the network improves your privacy. It gives the protocol more decoys to work with, and more diverse ones, effectively reducing your chances of picking up compromised ones.</p><p>On the topic of the diversity in the source of these outputs, it is also very important as it reduces the chances of picking up decoys known to third-parties collecting data on large numbers of outputs from a single source (i.e., an exchange keeping tabs on all the Monero outputs of its users). Note that this becomes a much bigger problem if and when these parties start collaborating together and sharing their collected data with each other.</p><h3 id=\"opt-in-privacy-and-the-human-factor\">Opt-in Privacy and the Human Factor</h3><p>At the protocol level, RingCT's privacy isn't directly affected by whether or not it is mandated or the default transaction type of the blockchain.</p><p>If, for example, Particl’s RingCT layer had a similar number of transactions per day as Monero, it would have a somewhat comparable level of privacy <strong>at the protocol level</strong>. But, in practice, it gets a bit more complicated because, as mentioned earlier in this article, everything has trade-offs.</p><p>In the case of opt-in privacy, the trade-off is the human factor. Having the ability to switch back and forth between public and anon balances opens the door to human errors and sub-optimal protocol usage. As with all cryptocurrencies, including private-by-default assets like Monero, there are some considerations and best practices to keep in mind to maintain a good level of privacy. </p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> The risks typically associated with the human factor are mostly applicable to normal peer-to-peer anon transactions between two users. Using Particl applications, like the marketplace, significantly reduces the risk of human error by automatically applying some of the recommended best practices.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"leveraging-particl-applications-to-boost-privacy\">Leveraging Particl Applications to Boost Privacy</h2><p>As previously mentioned, the Particl project is much, much more than just a cryptocurrency. It's an ecosystem of distributed apps that respect your rights, with one of these rights being the right to privacy. And that's precisely where lies Particl's mind-blowing privacy potential; in its apps!</p><p>To understand why that is, let’s take the Particl Marketplace app as an example once again. It lets you buy and sell anything online with no restriction. It is private by default, meaning that all payments for goods and services have to use RingCT. For sellers, there's the option to pay for their listing fees (listing an item for sale on the marketplace) using anon transactions. </p><p>And thus, each item listed on the marketplace generates at least one transaction, meaning that a seller who wants to list 100 items will generate 100 unique anon transactions alone plus two other anon transactions per sale (as both the buyer and the seller have to make an anon transaction to complete the escrow private smart-contract).</p><p>As is self-evident, simple usage of the Particl apps like the marketplace dramatically scales the number of real, \"high-quality\" anon transactions per day on the network up. To get an idea, simply think of how many e-commerce transactions happen every day on the web. How many items are listed online. Sure, that's an unfairly large segment to compare Particl to, but just think of how many transactions happen just within the still-very-niche decentralized marketplace segment (i.e., OpenSea). </p><blockquote><em>\"To hide the signal, you must generate noise\"</em> - Kewde, Particl developer</blockquote><p>As a reference, Monero does around a solid 16,000 transactions per day at the time of writing this piece. Could usage of Particl Marketplace generate similar numbers? The jury is still out but one can speculate.</p><p>And the cherry on top? Particl Marketplace, and all future Particl applications like the upcoming BasicSwap DEX, is entirely decentralized and trustless. There's no central party able to collect any data about you, your anon outputs, or those of other participants on the network; a very unique advantage of Particl over other privacy coins.</p><p>In other words, using Particl applications not only increases the number of anon transactions and outputs on the network, but it also does so in a way that improves the quality and effectiveness of available decoys. As current and future Particl applications gain more adoption, so does the the level of on-chain privacy as well.</p><h2 id=\"new-privacy-boons-abound\">New Privacy Boons Abound</h2><p>Particl is fortunate to be built on the Bitcoin codebase. Indeed, contrary to what many think, the Bitcoin codebase is evolving rapidly and is going through a particularly innovative phase. That is especially true of recent progress made on the Lightning Network and Taproot, both of which innovations are available on Particl and enhanced by an extra RingCT bridge for added anonymity.</p><p>Not mandating RingCT transactions gives us the ability to leverage and combine these breakthrough developments from the Bitcoin community to massively improve Particl's privacy and make its applications better for all. </p><p><strong>Complex and Private LN-based Smart-Contracts</strong><br>Indeed, recent developments have made it possible to run complex smart-contracts on the Lightning Network. These smart-contracts can even be deployed using CT to keep the amounts transferred confidential. This is a significant development for the Bitcoin community as it dramatically improves your privacy and opens the coin up to even more use-cases. But there is a small caveat; blinded smart-contracts don't hide the identities of people using them; only the transacted amounts remain confidential.</p><p>If that smart-contract was powering the escrow of some hypothetical marketplace, it could be possible to tell the identity of the seller and the buyer of a given transaction. On Particl, the additional layer of RingCT would keep both the buyer and the seller private by letting them enter and exit the Lightning Network without leaving a trace. </p><p><strong>Taproot Scripts</strong><br>With Taproot now being enabled on Particl, new on-chain scripting options have become available. Taproot enables more advanced, but also more private, complex transactions by combining multiple keys and signatures into one. With it, you can pre-emptively program payments within a group of people and trigger them following a set of pre-defined conditions. The resulting transactions look just like any other regular transaction on the blockchain and neither the conditions nor the identities of the participants are exposed.  </p><p>This opens a ton of opportunities, like for example <a href=\"https://learningblocks.io/taproot-and-the-lightning-network-a-match-made-in-heaven/\">entering and exiting the Lightning Network more privately</a>, making Particl's treasury entirely decentralized, making BasicSwap DEX swaps with Bitcoin-based currencies look just like a normal transaction, or even <a href=\"https://youtu.be/gF4Mkkhyz1Q?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61KHzhg3JIJdK08JLSlcLId&#x26;t=4291\">making some core components of Particl quantum-proof</a>. And that's just to name a few of the possibilites... </p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> In both the cases of LN and Taproot, it's important to note that RingCT transactions are not directly merged with LN and taproot, but rather run upon entering and exiting the L2 network to break the history.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"so-should-part-become-private-by-default\">So, Should PART Become Private-by-Default?</h2><p>Ultimately, there is no right or wrong answer to this debate. With both options, there are pros, cons, and trade-offs. There is no perfect solution; it all depends on the purpose of a specific cryptocurrency and the mission it’s trying to accomplish. However, we are highly confident that Particl's current privacy setup strikes the optimal utility/privacy balance for what it seeks to accomplish and for who it seeks to accomplish it for. </p><p>And although PART can be said to be less private than competing privacy coins such as Monero, an obvious statement considering the difference in the number of transactions between the two networks <strong>at this present time</strong>, its privacy potential is just as solid, if not even better, assuming decent usage of Particl's distributed applications and that best practices are followed by users.</p><p>PART's public addresses provide a lot of capabilities that are key to Particl's ecosystem and they cannot be readily dismissed. For this reason, and for the other reasons mentioned earlier in the blog post, <strong>the Particl team does not plan to switch to an exclusively private-by-default model of transactional privacy in the foreseeable future</strong>. We want to reiterate our strong confidence in our current model and are focusing on building applications that will organically raise the diversity and number of anon transactions and outputs on the network.</p><p>That being said, we remain open to adjusting our position on this matter in the future depending on how things evolve.</p><h2 id=\"particl-desktop-privacy-improvements-on-the-way-\">Particl Desktop Privacy Improvements on the Way!</h2><p>The fact that we embrace an opt-in privacy setup doesn't mean we can't work towards reducing potential mistakes caused by the human factor. </p><p>As such, Particl Core contains a few improvements in the RingCT implementation that mitigate some of the risks introduced by the opt-in nature of PART's privacy setup. </p><p>Also, <strong>in the next few Particl Desktop updates</strong>, you can expect new privacy-focused UI additions and improvements that seek to reduce the risk of human errors to a minimum. For example, a simple \"churning function\" that automatically churns your anon outputs (generates privacy-enhancing transactions (send-to-self) and creates more noise to hide within) to improve your privacy and everyone else's as well. Stay tuned to our <a href=\"https://particl.news/tag/progress/\"><strong>weekly development updates</strong></a> for more information.</p><hr><h2 id=\"synergy-and-collaboration-not-tribalism-and-exclusion\">Synergy and Collaboration, not Tribalism and Exclusion</h2><p>Particl's purpose is to build an ecosystem of apps that respect your rights and is as inclusive as possible. The race to the top for the most private features on a cryptocurrency is something we keep in mind without prime focus, although we fully believe PART can eventually become as such once the adoption of the Particl platform grows.</p><p>As part of this vision, we are working on a cross-chain and private decentralized trading exchange (BasicSwap DEX) that lets you swap different cryptocurrencies without the use of any third-party.</p><p>That means you can easily enter and exit the Particl ecosystem using your favorite privacy coin such as Monero, for example, and enjoy the benefits of both chains at the same time. </p><p>By combining Monero's private-by-default currency-focused approach and Particl's app-focused vision, you can reach strong levels of privacy few people thought were possible. The trade-offs of using an opt-in privacy coin (Particl) can then be offset by using an opt-out one (Monero) on the platform, just like Monero can offset its trade-offs (lack of distributed apps and more rigidity) by bridging into the Particl ecosystem using BasicSwap. A win-win situation for both blockchains and a major victory for the people.</p><p>Once the DEX is integrated into Particl desktop client, Particl Desktop, the synergy it creates with other privacy coins will take the entire privacy enthusiast community to the next level. You'll be able to use distributed and private applications without making any security or privacy compromise and by using your favorite coin.</p><p>Indeed, synergy, not tribalism, is how we see the privacy coin space evolving to the direct benefit of the people. There are many different approaches to privacy and it’s difficult to say which one is the best because, in part, use-cases and target audiences differ so much. And so, why not combine different options and work in unison towards bringing more privacy to the average joe? That's what we set out to do with Particl, and what we'll keep giving our blood, sweat, and tears to day after day!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr>\n<h3 id=\"join-the-discussion\">Join the discussion</h3>\n<p>What's your stance?

We can obviously point the finger at climate changes, but data centers,\n   especially in the western half of the United States, have a big portion of\n   the blame to take as well.\n * 30% of all data centers in the world are located in the USA, many in the\n   western half of it.\n * Tax breaks may help build data centers\n   [https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/arizona-passes-data-center-tax-breaks/] \n   but just who takes the responsibility to monitor the depletion of rivers,\n   lakes, and groundwater reservoirs these data centers cause?\n * In the U.S., the daily water consumption by data centers that report such\n   figures exceeds 1.7 billion liters of water.\n * This number is expected to only be 1/3rd of their actual consumption as it\n   only monitors the water consumption of their cooling systems.\n * Amazon, for example, does not bother measuring or reporting the water usage\n   of their data centers, a worrying fact considering Amazon’s AWS service is\n   powered by one of the biggest data center networks in the country\n   [https://www.wpoven.com/blog/aws-market-share/]. And don’t forget, Amazon’s\n   data consumption isn’t limited to AWS; its cloud outlets, Alexa product and,\n   of course, its Amazon.com [/houston-we-have-a-water-problem/Amazon.com] \n   marketplace, all require massive data warehouses to hold and process the\n   amount of data they collect.\n * And then, one out of five data centers is placed near a water reservoir which\n   is already stressed because of the nearby population. Water cooling is\n   cheaper than air cooling and it uses less energy, sure, but it creates water\n   shortages which tend to often be kept out of the public environmental debate.\n * Arizona for example, which is one of the hottest and driest states in the\n   U.S., is trying to become a new Silicon Valley. However, it relies on Lake\n   Mead (Hoover Dam) which is currently at a record low of 35% capacity\n   [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/06/10/lake-mead-water-lowest-hoover-dam-built-colorado-river-shortage/7640437002/]\n   . To make things worse, the Colorado River has lost 18% of its flow! But\n   still, companies are granted tax breaks, rebates, and promises of access to\n   water by some of the same people who claim to be fighting for the\n   environment.\n * Apple\n   [https://appleinsider.com/articles/17/05/10/apple-plans-major-expansions-at-arizona-and-nevada-data-centers]\n   , Google\n   [https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/mesa-council-approves-1bn-google-arizona-data-center-16m-tax-breaks/]\n   , Facebook\n   [https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/huge-data-center-moves-forward-in-mesa-despite-arizona-water-concerns/]\n   , and many other tech giants are already in Arizona, and are starting to\n   expand. That'll require more and more of that already rare water in the\n   region.\n * In Texas, Google requests 6.64 billion liters of water per year. Yes, a\n   single data center uses 10% of all its region’s water reserves which contains\n   20 towns.\n * In the meantime, Dallas encourages its citizens (that’s you, the individual)\n   to use less water as their six reservoirs are 18% depleted. They have a\n   mandatory water restriction in place once this number hits 35%, but they\n   welcome with open arms the insane water requests from tech giants.\n * At least, some tech giants like Microsoft report the water consumption on\n   their cooling systems (but not their total water consumption). That’s unlike\n   Amazon, Google, and Facebook who don’t bother to release any numbers to the\n   public [https://time.com/5814276/google-data-centers-water/].\n * In fact, most of them have 'non-disclosure agreements' NDAs with water\n   companies and local governments\n   [https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/after-aquifer-concerns-googles-600m-south-carolina-expansion-finds-new-water-supply/]\n   , to make sure their actual water usage stays a secret. Oh, the hypocrisy!\n\nThat’s a lot to take in, right? By now you probably get the point, but the\nreality is that we’ll need more and more data centers as the worldkeeps on\nincreasing its online presence. As it happens, we will need more data centers to\nsupport the various web services that you use (they all collect as much as they\ncan about you, your activities, preferences, location, habits, etc). What’s\nmore, the promised advent and monetization of AI will drive companies to\nincrease the number of data they collect from all of us, making data the new oil\nor digital gold.\n\nIt's time for a change!\nNo point in calling Houston, this problem won’t go away until we change our\nhabits ourselves. Let’s not be hypocrites here; yes, tech giants act in a very\ndeceiving way and try to sweep the problem under the rug for their own benefit\nand image, but we, the end-user, are ultimately the ones that feed them with the\ndata. As long as we keep using data-hungry services, we are directly causing\nthese environmental issues. The more we use their platforms, the more their data\ncenters will need to grow and the more water will be consumed.\n\nAnd as our online presence is much more likely increase rather than decrease\nover the coming years, there’s a critical question that bears asking.\n\nWhat can I actually do to fix this problem?\nLet's focus on what's under our control. We can’t change the way big tech and\nother internet companies behave; they are and always have been big for-profit\ncorporations with questionable levels of ethics. What we can do is change our\nonline habits and stop feeding “the beast”.\n\n> “Be the change that you wish to see in the world.” — Mahatma Gandhi\n“But how can I do this?”, you may ask. The answer may not be as hopeless as\nmight think. \n\nThe internet is currently experiencing what is perhaps its biggest revolution\nsince it began—the rise of \"Web 3\".\n\nWeb 3 is a general term used to reference a new type of applications and web\nservices that work without any third-party or middleman. They are often powered\nby blockchains or other peer-to-peer networks and manage data in a distributed\nway—data is hosted on the computers, or nodes, of the users rather than on\ncentral databases that literally suck the waters out of precious reserves.\n\nTake Particl Marketplace\n[/houston-we-have-a-water-problem/particl.io/marketplace], for example. It’s a\ndistributed online marketplace similar to eBay, but on which no data is\ngenerated. It provides all the essential tools you would need to buy and sell\nstuff online, but unlike eBay, Amazon, or Alibaba, it doesn’t require massive\ndata centers that evaporate our precious water reserves. In fact, it generates\nzero data and has a neutral water consumption level.\n\nOr take Skiff [https://skiff.org/] as another great example. It’s an end-to-end\nencrypted collaborative workspace that gives you similar abilities that you’d\nget using Google Docs, but it does so in a much more ethical way. First, it’s\nprivate and encrypted by default, meaning the company behind cannot collect any\nmeaningful data about you (meaning they then need to store much less of it). And\nsecondly, they are in the process of making their application completely\ndistributed, meaning they could then drastically reduce their \"water consumption\nfootprint\". What a breath of fresh air when you compare this philosophy to what\nbig tech does.\n\nBut you don't even have to step into the new world of Web 3 yet to make a\ndifference. Just change your DNS to one that doesn’t track your every move and\nstores that information in data centers! And by picking the right DNS, you might\neven block all those invasive and annoying ads that you see when you browse the\nweb, use your smart phone or smart tv, and etc. Sounds interesting? Then check\nout this list of recommended DNS servers\n[https://dt.gl/privacy-cookbook-ch-2-4-2021-best-of-dns/]. One small effort that\nimproves your online experience and helps to save our waters, what's not to\nlike?!\n\nChange is now! [https://dt.gl/privacy-cookbook-ch-2-4-2021-best-of-dns/]\nPeople talk a lot about energy consumption, renewable energies, and climate\nchange. But for some reason, water consumption rarely seems to receive the\nscrutiny it should. And you’ve got to wonder why; it is the most scarce treasure\nwe have and it’s rapidly becoming a nightmare to manage. But perhaps the\ncompanies who use the most of it are those with the deepest pockets\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-big-tech-got-even-bigger-11612587632] and the\nmost...influence?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTogether, we can make a vast difference. All we need is to be aware of the\nproblem and the simple, low-efforts solutions we can all take to protect our\nblue gold. By opting to use Web 3 applications and services rather than\nplatforms powered by massive data centers, we can considerably reduce our levels\nof water consumption and make a real impact; the only reason tech giants need to\nbuild more and more data centers is because we keep on using their applications!\n\n> “Sometimes you’re the only one that can save yourself; for no one is coming to\nsave you.” — R.J.

While they\naggressively charge you for every sale you make, they also get to see all of\nyour sales data; valuable information to have if you want to launch products.\nEven better if you plan on launching copycats! In more than one way, just by\nselling on their platform, they get you to pay them…to do their market research.\nInsulting, isn’t it?\n\nSee, the problematic issue here is that Amazon doesn't expose itself to any risk\nwhen launching a new product, nor do they go through the time and effort of\nresearching consumer needs and likes; that’s your burden to carry if you want to\nsucceed, and their success to steal if you do! Instead, Amazon simply accesses\n'your' sales data that you generate when using their platform and use some AI to\ninstantly know what products are selling best or will sell best in the future.\nThen, all that’s left for them to do is to hand the identified product (aka your\nproduct) over to a third-party manufacturer who will create a copycat out of it,\nwith a few minor modifications so that they can avoid almost any patent. The end\nresult? An AmazonBasics product (or one that is sold under any of their\nsub-brands\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-owns-these-brands-list-2018-7]) that’s\nmuch cheaper than the original, both in price…and quality.\n\nIt’s a cynically cost-effective strategy for an organization that has a\nnear-infinite budget and customer reach. And it’s much more so when they control\nwhat is likely to be the world’s most popular online marketplace. \n\nThey copied you, but you’re still making more sales than they’d like? No\nproblem, they’ll just move you to page 10! And while that may sound like a\nshort-term win for consumers because it gets them cheaper products, it is really\na net loss for all when nobody wants to innovate and come up with new products\nanymore out of fear of being screwed over.\n\nThink of it. Imagine being the inventor of a copied product, who invested the\nintellectual and financial capital into its development, put in blood, sweat,\nand tears to get it to production, only to be screwed over right at the moment\nthat he starts getting a tiny bit of success with his product. And Amazon, who\nwere making a handsome (exorbitant) commission selling the original product in\nthe first place, go on to brazenly become your direct competitor using an\nobvious copycat. Of course, to make things even worse, Amazon gets to sell their\nproduct without paying the exorbitant sales fees any other vendor would be\nforced to pay. And so, the consumer loses, the small and local businesses as\nwell, the product inventors too, but Amazon gets to rake in billions of dollars.\nSounds fair and ethical…not!\n\nPrivacy in eCommerce — Protect Your BusinessHow Privacy Can Help You Keep Your\nBusiness AliveParticl Newsdros\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/]\nOpportunistic Behaviour, aka 'Screwing Partners Over'\nLet's look at things from a different perspective.\n\nImagine you start a company that produces something that is 'better than sliced\nbread'. You’ve made it; your business has become successful, and Amazon's\nventure capital arm reaches out to you. Sounds exciting, right? Well, slow down\na little and let's take a look at a couple of examples that might make you\nreconsider whether you would even want to talk to them.\n\nA while ago, Amazon’s fund invested in Defined Crowd [https://www.defined.ai/].\nAs part of that investment, Amazon got access to the finances as well as the\ntechnology of Defined Crowd. Four years later, Daniela Braga, the founder and\nCEO of the company, accused Amazon of stealing their concept\n[https://www.pymnts.com/amazon/2020/report-companies-say-amazon-accessed-proprietary-info-to-make-its-own-products/] \nand launching it as A21, a service of Amazon Web Services (AWS) that is in\ndirect competition with them. Dealing with Amazon can turn a supposedly helpful\ncapital boost into your worst nightmare.\n\nUbi, who build smart speakers, met Amazon to discuss funding for their product\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-echo-ubi-smart-speaker-2020-7]. Amazon\nwent through their entire pitch, the tech behind it, and shortly afterwards,\nlaunched Echo. Yes, the same Echo that powers Alexa. It was a concept imagined\nby someone who had a billion-dollar idea, but it more than likely ended up being\nstolen and developed by a company too big to drag through court.\n\nIndeed, Amazon has so many more reports of unethical behaviours and unfair,\nanti-competitive practices. Want to hear more about it? Just take this example\nfrom India where Amazon was caught red-handing manipulating search results to\nbenefit their own products and competing ones (and in many cases, original\nproducts that Amazon simply copied, as we mentioned above).\n\nAmazon copied products and rigged search results, documents showA trove of\nAmazon documents reveals how the company ran a campaign in India of creating\nknockoff goods and manipulating search results to boost its own\nproducts.Reuters\nADITYA KALRA in New Delhi and STEVE STECKLOW in London\n[https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-rigging/]In\nthe end, in all of those cases, someone or a business got AMAZONED!\n\nThankfully, Amazon is gradually being made more accountable and is having to \nanswer to the US House Judiciary Committee\n[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/house-committee-threatens-amazon-with-criminal-investigation-into-market-dominance] \nfor its immoral and unethical behaviours, but who knows what positive changes\nthat will bring, if any. But really, there is a way for you to protect yourself\nfrom this toxic relationship. Imagine this...\n\nImagine taking Amazon out of your life. Even better, imagine taking any\ncorporate-powered online marketplace like eBay, Alibaba, Etsy, or even payment\nprocessors like Paypal out of your life. Because after all, they all operate\nmore or less the same predatory way.\n\nImagine getting a 5% to 60% (!!!) discount on products and services you buy. You\nknow…what these corporations would typically charge you.\n\nImagine buying unique, more affordable, and more varied products that don’t\nusually end up on their platform. Maybe they come from countries that have no\naccess to them, or maybe they simply don’t want these products around.\n\nImagine if you could directly support local businesses, not corporations, by\ntrading directly with them without anybody in between.\n\nImagine buying or selling stuff online without sharing all your personal\ninformation and data to greedy corporations eager to abuse it for a cheap buck.\nGoodbye leaked credit cards and identify thefts.\n\nImagine buying \"intimate gifts\" for your girlfriend without your wife knowing\nabout it or, huh, well, you know, buying anything without leaving a trace behind\nfor whatever reason applies to you ? #PrivacyMatters\n\nImagine no More!\nStop imagining and start doing what’s best for you now because all of this is\nnow possible thanks to decentralized eCommerce (“DeCommerce”). \n\nDeCommerce has been steadily on the rise in recent years, letting anybody safely\nbuy or sell anything online without any restriction and without going through\nany middleman. So imagine trading directly with other people, without paying any\nfee, and without any restriction or shady practices we too often see. The future\nis here!\n\nDeCommerce is indeed the next logical step towards a world that is freer and a\nfairer. Towards a world where our right to privacy still exists. One where equal\nopportunities are available to all with no regards to where you come from or to\nwho you are.\n\nYou may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one. The DeCommerce revolution\nis already well-underway here at Partic [https://particl.io/marketplace]l\n[https://particl.io/marketplace]. All of the benefits you imagined above are\nalready available at your fingertips. \n\nIf you, too, want to see a better world and get more out of your honest money,\nthen come be a part of our global movement [https://particl.io/].

As we are jumping into\nthis new decade with both feet\n[https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819], it’s time to\nget serious about the adoption of the marketplace. As such, the Particl team has\ncrafted a new and pretty extensive development roadmap that specifically focuses\non bringing what needs to be brought for Particl’s marketplace to be considered\n“adoption-ready”.\n\nBut before getting into it, let’s make sure we understand where the Particl\nmarketplace currently stands — what are its strengths and unique offerings, how\nfar has it come since being released, and what prevents it from getting adopted\nby more users. Once that is understood, it then becomes easier to wrap our heads\naround what needs to be done moving forward to make sure the marketplace gets\nthe success it quite frankly deserves.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat Makes Particl’s Marketplace Unique?\nParticl’s Open Marketplace is most definitely a unique offering in the eCommerce\nindustry, even still to this day. It allows online sellers and buyers to connect\ndirectly with each other, without requiring any sort of middleman assistance\n(i.e. a company operating an online marketplace), and conduct business without\nthe usual costs associated with selling and buying online such as transaction\nfees, sales commissions, marketplace subscriptions, currency conversions, and\netc.\n\nAdditionally, the marketplace is also built using various security and\nprivacy-enhancing technologies so that no data (i.e. sales data) or personal\ninformation can be collected by any outside party, a particularly important perk\nin an age where data mining, monetization, breaches, and leaks have become far\ntoo common. Equally as important, better privacy within the eCommerce industry\nundoubtedly leads to better business and competitive practices as well as a more\nfair environment for sellers.\n\nOn top of that combination of near-zero cost and superior data security, the\nmarketplace requires no sign-up, no login, no personal or business information,\nis censorship-proof, free to use, and works from any country in the world, as\nlong as you can connect to the internet.\n\nQuite simply, there is not a single marketplace on the web offering such an\nambitious and novel combination of features. The reason for it is also quite\nsimple to understand — getting this full set of features packaged into a\nmarketplace requires the use of various novel distributed and privacy-preserving\nprotocols that have only recently been made available to developers across the\nworld.\n\nA Novel, Never-Been-Done-Before Concept\nAs a very obvious example of this, let’s take just one component that makes up\nParticl’s marketplace — its automated double deposit escrow system. Particl’s\nescrow system works on smart-contract functionalities and requires a combination\nof RingCT and CT cryptocurrency transactions so that any transaction information\nbetween a buyer and seller remains only known to these two transacting parties.\nIn other words, it makes escrow transactions completely untraceable and\nunlinkable to any party not associated with a particular marketplace\ntransaction.\n\nAnd while RingCT has been available, on Monero, for a few years now, it never\nwas built in a way that it could be used in smart-contracts. Additionally, most\nof the other currently available privacy protocols simply weren’t programmable\n(can’t be used in smart-contracts) or simply weren’t realistically scalable\nenough to make sense to use as part of a marketplace product. For this reason,\nthe Particl team had to build its own custom implementation of RingCT (and\nbulletproofs) so that it could be used by decentralized applications on the\nParticl network, and that’s only been available for a few months.\n\nThis is just one isolated example of technology that became available just\nrecently. Particl’s entire platform is composed of such novel components, and so\nit’s no wonder that there is still no marketplace in existence currently\noffering the same combination of perks as Particl does.\n\nPioneering Takes Time, Efforts, and a Solid Vision\nBut being at the edge of technology also has its drawbacks. After all, Particl’s\nmarketplace is still early Beta software and isn’t really the simplest\nmarketplace to use out there. It really works, but it simply can’t realistically\nbe expected to be adopted by any sort of “mainstream” type of user.\n\nIt does provide many benefits that are very real, but the technical knowledge\nand the learning curve required to even use it is still relatively steep. That’s\none of the biggest obstacles currently standing in Particl’s way when it comes\nto the adoption of the marketplace.\n\nBut rest assured, that is perfectly normal for any new technology that’s as\ngroundbreaking as Particl’s marketplace and uses technologies that have only\nbeen made available for a short time. It takes time to disrupt an industry\nthat’s as competitive as the eCommerce sector, and it also takes time for brand\nnew types of technologies to mature up to the point where most people feel\ncomfortable using it. Remember the advent of the internet in the early '90s?\n\nThe Particl team is indeed well aware of the marketplace’s current lack of\n“mainstream” appeal. Most of the features, functions, and general user\nexperience that would actually be expected from your typical marketplace user\n(think your parents, significant other, or friends that aren’t as “crypto crazy”\nas we all are) are still being built, and they’ve been nicely incorporated into\nthe new Particl 2020 development roadmap.\n\nSome of the additions required to make the marketplace more\n“mainstream-appealing” have already been deployed since first releasing the\nmarketplace on mainnet and can be used by anyone at this very moment. They are\neither features, improvements, or important functions that help make a buyer or\nseller’s life easier. Let’s review what these improvements and additions are and\nsee how has Particl’s marketplace evolved over the last few months.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow Has the Marketplace Evolved Since Launch?\nNot only has the marketplace consistently been pushing its all-time high number\nof listings higher and higher [https://www.demarkets.io/stats], but the number\nof mainnet transactions on the Particl network has also seen a\ndramatic rise [https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/#!overview], now averaging more\nthan 200 transactions per day. These transactions include listed items, escrow\ntransactions, the flagging of items, created and votes on community proposals,\nbalance transfers, and regular currency transactions.\n\nAdditionally, and perhaps even more importantly, the Particl network has been\ngetting much more private! Indeed, the network’s “anon set”, the number of\nRingCT outputs available to anonymize transactions, has been growing\nexponentially since the launch of the Open Marketplace, averaging a steady 30%\nor more increase per month. The anon set currently stands at 5232, a whopping\n149% increase since August 2019. To observe that value goes up and down by\nyourself, just open up your Particl Desktop wallet and type anonoutput in the\nconsole window. As the Open Marketplace and the Particl network gets more\nadoption, you can expect that number to keep rising, meaning RingCT transactions\nwill keep on getting more private.\n\nMore Tools and Features Made Available\nParticl’s Open Marketplace is still Beta software, meaning it is still very much\na work-in-progress and under heavy development. As such, it is normal that some\nof the intended features for its first “final” version are still missing to this\nday. The good thing, though, is that these features and improvements are coming\nup quite quickly!\n\nEver since the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace on the 12th of August,\n2019, we’ve seen these improvements go live…\n\n * Import products (bulk listing)\n\nThis feature allows sellers to import products from outside sources such as .csv\nfiles and WooCommerce stores. It is particularly useful to manage large\ninventories and list items in bulk. This feature is ultimately designed to reach\nits full potential when used in combination with the upcoming Market Management\n[https://particl.news/market-management-is-next-3e35356d5de0] and Inventory\nManagement tools.\n\n * Public comments (Q&A)\n\nThis feature allows anyone to leave a comment, review, feedback, or question on\nany listing posted on the Open Marketplace. Leaving a post notifies the seller\nof the item which can then respond. Posts made by the seller of an item are\nclearly identified as such. This feature is intended to better help you make\nbetter shopping decisions and know more about the items you’re looking to buy. \nPublic comments will tie in nicely with future reputation models intended to be\nimplemented at a later stage during the Beta stage of development.\n\n * Cancel bids\n\nIt used to be impossible to cancel an order before the seller accepted it,\nmeaning funds could get stuck in limbo when sellers were inactive and not\nprocessing orders. While it was possible to manually unlock these coins, it did\nrequire a fair bit of technical knowledge about the Particl platform itself. Far\nfrom ideal! This is why an update was made to the marketplace to add this\nimportant functionality.\n\n * Settings page\n\nThe first iteration of the Settings page has been added a few weeks after the\nlaunch of the Open Marketplace Beta. While it currently only contains basic\nsettings such as notification management and wallet backup options, the Settings\npage will play a bigger role once Market Management and other future major\nfeatures are integrated.\n\n * In-wallet Bitcoin exchange\n\nThis major and exciting update to Particl Desktop added the ability to swap\nBitcoin for Particl right inside the wallet. This means anyone can now “top up”\ntheir Open Marketplace account using Bitcoin. No need to register on an exchange\nor give away your personal information (i.e. KYC, IP address, etc), and it works\neverywhere, even in the US!\n\nThis exchange module is currently powered by the SMSG network and connects\ndirectly to the SimpleSwap [http://simpleswap.io] exchange, but is built in such\na way that it can integrate almost any exchange or service provider as long as\nthe required APIs are provided by the third-party. This update was very\nimportant as it opens the door for Particl to be adopted outside of its own\ncommunity by accepting a varied list of currencies.\n\n * Bot Management\n\nThe Bot Management feature was introduced at the same time as the Bitcoin\nExchange module was. It is, in fact, what powers it. The Bot Management feature\nallows you to use and list SMSG bots that provide added third-party services to\nParticl Desktop. These added services can be bridges to crypto exchanges or fiat\npayment gateways, as well as many other sorts of services.\n\nHowever, because this is the first iteration of the feature, it is currently not\npossible to manually add your bot to the list of available bots. That’s because\nsecurity measures still need to be put in place to make sure people do not push\nmalicious bots on the network. The Bot Management tool is planned to be an\nintegral part of the upcoming developer SDK.\n\n * SMSG improvements\n\nSMSG is the P2P network that powers the Open Marketplace. It securely and\nprivately hosts data (i.e. listing images and descriptions) and makes several\nprocesses possible such as displaying listings, flagging items, exchanging\nBitcoin for Particl, and etc. It is the backbone of the entire Particl\necosystem.\n\nSince the marketplace’s mainnet launch, the SMSG network has seen its\nperformance vastly improved, notably with how effectively it displays listings\nand communicates between peers. Improving SMSG will be an ongoing process as we\nmove forward through the Beta phase of development.\n\n * Significantly reduced listing fees\n\nOne of the big updates that were made to the SMSG network is the ability for\nstakers to signal lower listing fees to the network. What that means is that\nanyone staking on the Particl network can have a say on how much the network\ncharges users for publishing listings on the Open Marketplace.\n\nAs a result, ever since the launch of the Beta, listing fees have been reduced\nby a big fat 53%! This is already great, making it much cheaper for sellers to\nlist items, but fees are also expected to go down even more, by at least 80%, in\nthe next SMSG update. That’s what near-zero cost eCommerce means!\n\n * Various improvements, tweaks, and fixes based on user suggestions\n\nOn top of everything mentioned above, a LOT of tweaks, fixes, and improvements\nhave been made to both the code and the user experience of Particl Desktop and\nthe Open Marketplace. A lot of these changes have been made based on user\nfeedback, and it is the one reason why the “Report bug” button has been added at\nthe bottom left of the Particl Desktop client. All user feedback is very\nimportant and really makes it easier for Particl developers to see what areas\nneed to be improved or tweaked. The more feedback is received, the faster issues\ncan be addressed. For this reason, it is highly recommended to be pro-active in\nreporting issues and making suggestions on Github.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith all of the above in mind, it is clear that Particl’s marketplace is getting\nbetter and easier to use by the day. Of course, there is still some stuff\nmissing or that could be improved, but that’s more than normal given the Beta\nnature of the product.\n\nSo what’s left to do? What is the marketplace missing? What could be improved to\nbe able to attract a wider range of users and make sure they remain users over a\nlonger period of time?\n\nThat’s what we’ll be exploring later this week in a future article published\nhere at Particl.news [http://Particl.news]. These are all questions that the\nteam has asked itself recently, along with a few community contributors, and\nwhich resulted in a brand new (and dare I say…exciting!) development roadmap. \nWatch out for next week, because that’s when the new development roadmap will be\npublicly revealed!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-Progress-So-Far/1-l9wIwdXxGp6dWHRnhXfqPQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"it-s-almost-time-for-particl-to-shine-\">It’s almost time for Particl to shine! ?</h3><p>The Beta version of Particl’s Open Marketplace has been out for a few months now, and it’s been evolving pretty nicely ever since.

The anon set currently stands at 5232, a whopping 149% increase since August 2019. To observe that value goes up and down by yourself, just open up your Particl Desktop wallet and type anonoutput in the console window.

As we are <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819\"><strong>jumping into this new decade with both feet</strong></a>, it’s time to get serious about the adoption of the marketplace. As such, the Particl team has crafted a new and pretty extensive development roadmap that specifically focuses on bringing what needs to be brought for Particl’s marketplace to be considered “adoption-ready”.</p><p>But before getting into it, let’s make sure we understand where the Particl marketplace currently stands — what are its strengths and unique offerings, how far has it come since being released, and what prevents it from getting adopted by more users. Once that is understood, it then becomes easier to wrap our heads around what needs to be done moving forward to make sure the marketplace gets the success it quite frankly deserves.</p><hr><h2 id=\"what-makes-particl-s-marketplace-unique\">What Makes Particl’s Marketplace Unique?</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-Progress-So-Far/1-X5zYJtOFQWkVjnOD6Zr_nA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Particl’s Open Marketplace is most definitely a unique offering in the eCommerce industry, even still to this day. It allows online sellers and buyers to connect directly with each other, without requiring any sort of middleman assistance (i.e. a company operating an online marketplace), and conduct business without the usual costs associated with selling and buying online such as transaction fees, sales commissions, marketplace subscriptions, currency conversions, and etc.</p><p>Additionally, the marketplace is also built using various security and privacy-enhancing technologies so that no data (i.e. sales data) or personal information can be collected by any outside party, a particularly important perk in an age where data mining, monetization, breaches, and leaks have become far too common. Equally as important, better privacy within the eCommerce industry undoubtedly leads to better business and competitive practices as well as a more fair environment for sellers.</p><p>On top of that combination of near-zero cost and superior data security, the marketplace requires no sign-up, no login, no personal or business information, is censorship-proof, free to use, and works from any country in the world, as long as you can connect to the internet.</p><p>Quite simply, there is not a single marketplace on the web offering such an ambitious and novel combination of features. The reason for it is also quite simple to understand — getting this full set of features packaged into a marketplace requires the use of various novel distributed and privacy-preserving protocols that have only recently been made available to developers across the world.</p><h3 id=\"a-novel-never-been-done-before-concept\">A Novel, Never-Been-Done-Before Concept</h3><p>As a very obvious example of this, let’s take just one component that makes up Particl’s marketplace — its automated double deposit escrow system. Particl’s escrow system works on smart-contract functionalities and <strong>requires a combination of RingCT and CT cryptocurrency transactions</strong> so that any transaction information between a buyer and seller remains only known to these two transacting parties. In other words, it makes escrow transactions completely untraceable and unlinkable to any party not associated with a particular marketplace transaction.</p><p>And while RingCT has been available, on Monero, for a few years now, it never was built in a way that it could be used in smart-contracts. Additionally, most of the other currently available privacy protocols simply weren’t programmable (can’t be used in smart-contracts) or simply weren’t realistically scalable enough to make sense to use as part of a marketplace product. For this reason, the Particl team had to build its own custom implementation of RingCT (and bulletproofs) so that it could be used by decentralized applications on the Particl network, and that’s only been available for a few months.</p><p>This is just one isolated example of technology that became available just recently. Particl’s entire platform is composed of such novel components, and so it’s no wonder that there is still no marketplace in existence currently offering the same combination of perks as Particl does.</p><h3 id=\"pioneering-takes-time-efforts-and-a-solid-vision\">Pioneering Takes Time, Efforts, and a Solid Vision</h3><p>But being at the edge of technology also has its drawbacks.

Because of that, Particl was able to\ndeliver on its two biggest promised deliverables for mainnet —the Open\nMarketplace and RingCT (untraceable transactions).\n\nParticl’s Open Marketplace live on mainnet!Yes, 2019 was a development heavy\nyear. That is thanks to a passionate team of developers and contributors who\nsimply won’t give up on the idea of private, free, and borderless eCommerce.\nThey breathe and bleed Particl, and each day they help make that vision a\nreality and make it more and more accessible to everybody.\n\nTogether, let’s go through the 2019 development timeline.

Keep in mind it doesn’t even include Particl\nCore releases! ?\n\nIndeed, one particularly impressive aspect of Particl’s development is how it\nalways keeps its codebase up-to-date with the latest Bitcoin codebase version.\nThat’s to ensure Particl’s base layer benefits from all the latest Bitcoin\nimprovements so that it can remain secure and can easily integrate any\ninnovation happening in Bitcoin’s world. Put simply, an up-to-date codebase\nmeans security, reliability, performance, and compatibility.\n\nAnd while “keeping the codebase up-to-date” may initially sound like a simple\nand almost robotic task, there’s definitely a reason barely any Bitcoin-based\n“altcoin”, if any, properly keeps its codebase up-to-date — it’s a tedious and\nquite complicated task. That’s because the upstream Bitcoin code needs to be\nmade to fit and be compatible with any added component to Particl’s codebase. It\ncouldn’t further from a simple “copy-paste process”…\n\nThis year, this translated into 19 individual core releases, a true testament to\nthe constant hard work put in by Particl’s Core Developer & Cryptographic\nResearcher Tecnovert [https://github.com/tecnovert].\n\nParticl Core Releases (19 total)\n * Jan. 1, 2019 —Particl Core 0.17.1.0\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.0]\n * Feb. 6, 2019 —Particl Core 0.17.1.2\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.2]\n * Feb. 14, 2019 —Particl Core 0.17.1.3\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.3]\n * Mar. 7, 2019 —Particl Core 0.17.1.4\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.4]\n * May 9, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.0.7\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.7]\n * Jun. 4, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.0.8\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.8]\n * Jun. 24, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.0.10\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.10]\n * Jul. 2, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.0.11\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.11]\n * Jul. 18, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.0.12\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.12]\n * Aug. 4, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.0\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.0]\n * Aug. 8, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.1\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.1]\n * Aug. 12, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.2\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.2]\n * Aug. 22, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.3\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.3]\n * Sep. 3, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.4\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.4]\n * Sep. 26, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.5\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.5]\n * Oct. 29, 2019 —Particl Core 0.19.0.1 RC2 (Pre-Release)\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1rc2]\n * Oct. 31, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.6\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.6]\n * Dec. 4, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.7 (Pre-Release)\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.7]\n * Dec. 3, 2019 —Particl Core 0.19.0.1 (Pre-Release)\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Around the World\nAnother great move by Particl in 2019 was to increase its boots-on-the-ground\npresence by attending, sponsoring, and presenting at several blockchain\nconferences, events, and meetups all around the world.\n\nSome of Particl’s team after SFBW’s Epicenter conferenceBlockchain events are\nideal networking opportunities for teams to find each other, build\nrelationships, and start collaborating on multiple fronts. In that sense, they\nare the perfect “matchmakers”.\n\nAs such, the Particl team has made a lot of key connections with individuals and\nteams that will help the project make the jump from an almost exclusively\ndevelopment focused project to one putting much more focus into the user\nadoption of its platform.\n\nIt’s very important to understand one thing, though, is that these relationships\nbuilt at blockchain events can take some time until they start yielding visible\nresults. Most of the time, it takes many dozens of work hours and conference\ncalls before things fall into place and start moving ahead. The best example of\nthis concept is with the addition of Spend.com [https://spend.com]’s President,\nBryan Woods, as new eCommerce strategic advisor for Particl.\n\nParticl Welcomes Spend.com President as New Advisor\n[https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-spend-com-president-as-new-advisor-7afcce8c7d71]\nBryan Woods — eCommerce Strategy and Adoption ?particl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-spend-com-president-as-new-advisor-7afcce8c7d71]\n\nThe Particl team met with Bryan at Consensus 2019, in May, and only started\ntalking about it more publicly when it was announced at SFBW’s Epicenter, in\nNovember, that he would be joining Particl’s advisory board. Still to this day,\nit is too early to reveal any of what’s being worked on with him even though\nit’s been in the works for quite some time now.\n\nDr. Kap Talking at SFBW’s EpicenterThe bottom line is that these blockchain\nevents are great to make valuable connections that, over time, will come back\nhelping the project tremendously. The team is currently in active talks with\nmany people and projects met at conferences and it should yield more visible\nresults later on in 2020.\n\nPut simply, some of the best decisions taken by the Particl team in 2019 was to\nattend Consensus and the San Francisco Blockchain Week (SFBW).\n\n2019 Conferences and Events\n * Feb. 4, 2019 —Particl in Paris — CoinHouse\n   [https://particl.news/particl-in-paris-presentations-at-coinhouse-a38106cdd36a] \n    ??\n * Mar. 13–14, 2019 —Particl in Hong Kong — Token2049\n   [https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b] \n    ??\n * May 11–12, 2019 —Particl in NYC — Magical Crypto Conference\n   [https://particl.news/particl-in-nyc-magical-crypto-conference-2019-459c1f868522] \n    ??\n * May 13–15, 2019 —Particl in NYC — Consensus\n   [https://particl.news/particl-in-nyc-consensus-2019-3f6671bd2aa6] ??\n * June 25–26, 2019 —Particl in San Francisco — Bitcoin2019\n   [https://particl.news/particl-in-san-francisco-bitcoin2019-571fe31fe396] ??\n * Oct. 28–29, 2019 —Particl in Vegas — Money2020\n   [https://particl.news/particl-world-tour-2019-f6e3d3c7e09c] ??\n * Oct. 30, 2019 —Particl in Vegas — World Crypto Conference\n   [https://particl.news/particl-world-tour-2019-f6e3d3c7e09c] ??\n * Oct. 28-Nov. 3, 2019 —Particl in San Francisco — SFBW\n   [https://particl.news/particl-in-san-francisco-sfbw-2019-bdaf0426349a] ??\n * Nov. 14, 2019 —Particl in Singapore — Blockshow\n   [https://particl.news/particl-world-tour-2019-f6e3d3c7e09c] ??\n * Nov. 21–22, 2019 —Particl in Finland — Slush Helsinki\n   [https://particl.news/particl-in-finland-slush-helsinki-1383c1d083c3] ??\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat Can We Take Back From 2019?\nLast year was a year of straight-up delivery with both Particl’s long-awaited\nOpen Marketplace and RingCT (with Bulletproofs) going live on mainnet. More\nimportantly, 2019 will forever be the year where private, free, and borderless\neCommerce became a reality for everyone. A very important milestone in human\ncommerce’s history when you think of it…\n\nIt’s also a year where it became obvious that simply pushing innovative and\nunique blockchain code just doesn’t cut it alone for a project to see great\nsuccess and get decent exposure. And that’s okay, even great, because it signals\nthat the industry is becoming more mature and wants to see blockchain products\nfinally get some “real-world adoption”. That’s the metaphorical “blockchain\nkiller product”, and that’s precisely why Particl is bound to shine moving\nforward!\n\nIn fact, the Open Marketplace is a unique offering — it offers unmatched privacy\nin eCommerce and allows sellers and buyers to connect directly and safely\ntransact by paying almost no fee at all. It takes third-parties (marketplace\noperator, payment processor, web host, etc) totally out of the eCommerce process\nand secures the user’s data and personal information at every step of the way, a\nperk that’s definitely becoming more and more valuable in an era of\never-increasing data mining, breaches, and identity thefts\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/08/20/data-breaches-expose-41-billion-records-in-first-six-months-of-2019/#59551d93bd54]\n.\n\nParticl’s Adoption\nYet, the level of adoption of the marketplace is still relatively low at this\nmoment, a surprising fact for some. That’s due to a few reasons both internal\nand external to Particl, and luckily none of these reasons should really sound\nthe alarm bell.\n\nSome of these reasons are directly due to Particl itself. In fact, the Open\nMarketplace is still very much an early Beta software and is simply not ready\nfor mass adoption just yet. After all, it more than clearly says so in the\nmarketplace’s header banner on Particl Desktop.\n\nAs a matter of fact, some of the processes as well as the user interface of the\nmarketplace are still relatively complicated for most people to use. The\nmarketplace also lacks a few important features usually expected by either\nbuyers or sellers on traditional online marketplaces. In reality, any\nsignificant amount of money invested towards aggressive user adoption campaigns\nwould more than likely result in a poor user adoption rates simply due to the\nearliness of Particl’s product. Getting people to peek around is one thing,\ngetting them to become Particl marketplace users is another thing entirely.\n\nSome of the reasons are also external to Particl. For example, the more than\ntwo-year-long cryptocurrency “bear market” surely hasn’t really encouraged\nlong-term cryptocurrency holders to spend their coins the same way a “bull\nmarket” would…\n\nA New Roadmap is on the Way\nThe very good news is that the Particl team is very aware of its marketplace’s\nbottlenecks! With Market Management, a very major marketplace update, coming out\nin a few weeks, it will mark the completion of a very high-level overview of\nwhat the marketplace was initially imagined to be — an open eCommerce network\npopulated by an infinite amount of markets. In other words, the release of\nMarket Management marks the end of a very particular development phase for the\nproject.\n\nThat being said, that also means that it marks the very beginning of a new\ndevelopment phase, one that will be all about building the right features and\ntools for its targeted users. This new phase will also be all about increasing\nthe marketplace’s accessibility, ease of use, and user interface as much as\npossible. In simple terms, this new phase is all about eliminating any reason\nwhy most people would not buy and/or sell on Particl.\n\nBuckle Up!\nIn the next few days, multiple blog posts will be published on Particl.news\n[http://Particl.news]. They will be a deep dive into the marketplace’s current\nstatus, its level of adoption, and current bottlenecks. They will also explain,\nin detail, the reasoning behind the Particl team’s strategy moving forward as it\njumps in this new decade with both feet. This mini blog post series will\nultimately culminate with the exciting reveal of the new Particl roadmap! Get\nready, as the new roadmap is more than likely to blow a few people’s minds! ?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Particl team would love to thank you all for being part of this very special\nproject and wishes you a very fruitful new decade.

Keep in mind it doesn’t even include Particl Core releases! ?</p><p>Indeed, one particularly impressive aspect of Particl’s development is how <strong>it always keeps its codebase up-to-date with the latest Bitcoin codebase version</strong>. That’s to ensure Particl’s base layer benefits from all the latest Bitcoin improvements so that it can remain secure and can easily integrate any innovation happening in Bitcoin’s world. Put simply, an up-to-date codebase means <strong>security</strong>, <strong>reliability</strong>, <strong>performance</strong>, and <strong>compatibility</strong>.</p><p>And while “keeping the codebase up-to-date” may initially sound like a simple and almost robotic task, there’s definitely a reason barely any Bitcoin-based “altcoin”, if any, properly keeps its codebase up-to-date — it’s a tedious and quite complicated task. That’s because the upstream Bitcoin code needs to be made to fit and be compatible with any added component to Particl’s codebase. It couldn’t further from a simple “copy-paste process”…</p><p>This year, this translated into <strong>19 individual core releases</strong>, a true testament to the constant hard work put in by Particl’s Core Developer &amp; Cryptographic Researcher <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert\"><strong>Tecnovert</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"particl-core-releases-19-total-\">Particl Core Releases (19 total)</h3><ul><li>Jan. 1, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.0\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.0</strong></a></li><li>Feb. 6, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.2\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.2</strong></a></li><li>Feb. 14, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.3\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.3</strong></a></li><li>Mar. 7, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.4\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.4</strong></a></li><li>May 9, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.7\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.7</strong></a></li><li>Jun. 4, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.8\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.8</strong></a></li><li>Jun. 24, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.10\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.10</strong></a></li><li>Jul. 2, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.11\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.11</strong></a></li><li>Jul. 18, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.12\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.12</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 4, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.0\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.0</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 8, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.1\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.1</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 12, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.2\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.2</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 22, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.3\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.3</strong></a></li><li>Sep. 3, 2019 —<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.4\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.4</strong></a></li><li>Sep. 26, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.5\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.5</strong></a></li><li>Oct. 29, 2019 —<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1rc2\"> <strong>Particl Core 0.19.0.1 RC2 (Pre-Release)</strong></a></li><li>Oct. 31, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.6\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.6</strong></a></li><li>Dec. 4, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.7\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.7 (Pre-Release)</strong></a></li><li>Dec. 3, 2019 —<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1\"><strong>Particl Core 0.19.0.1 (Pre-Release)</strong></a></li></ul><hr><h2 id=\"particl-around-the-world\">Particl Around the World</h2><p>Another great move by Particl in 2019 was to increase its boots-on-the-ground presence by attending, sponsoring, and presenting at several blockchain conferences, events, and meetups all around the world.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-s-2019-Year-in-Review/1-Gbg9aHfYJ9bhiThjAvvKwQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Some of Particl’s team after SFBW’s Epicenter conference</figcaption></figure><p>Blockchain events are ideal networking opportunities for teams to find each other, build relationships, and start collaborating on multiple fronts.

Most of the time, it takes many dozens of work hours and conference calls before things fall into place and start moving ahead.

More importantly, 2019 will forever be the year where private, free, and borderless eCommerce became a reality for everyone. A very important milestone in human commerce’s history when you think of it…</p><p>It’s also a year where it became obvious that simply pushing innovative and unique blockchain code just doesn’t cut it alone for a project to see great success and get decent exposure. And that’s okay, even great, because it signals that the industry is becoming more mature and wants to see blockchain products finally get some “real-world adoption”. That’s the metaphorical “blockchain killer product”, and <strong>that’s precisely why Particl is bound to shine moving forward!</strong></p><p>In fact, the Open Marketplace is a unique offering — it offers <strong>unmatched privacy in eCommerce</strong> and <strong>allows sellers and buyers to connect directly and safely transact by paying almost no fee at all</strong>. It takes third-parties (marketplace operator, payment processor, web host, etc) totally out of the eCommerce process and secures the user’s data and personal information at every step of the way, a perk that’s definitely becoming more and more valuable in <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/08/20/data-breaches-expose-41-billion-records-in-first-six-months-of-2019/#59551d93bd54\"><strong>an era of ever-increasing data mining, breaches, and identity thefts</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"particl-s-adoption\">Particl’s Adoption</h3><p>Yet, the level of adoption of the marketplace is still relatively low at this moment, a surprising fact for some. That’s due to a few reasons both internal and external to Particl, and luckily none of these reasons should really sound the alarm bell.</p><p><strong>Some of these reasons are directly due to Particl itself</strong>. In fact, the Open Marketplace is still very much an <strong>early Beta software</strong> and is simply not ready for mass adoption just yet. After all, it more than clearly says so in the marketplace’s header banner on Particl Desktop.</p><p>As a matter of fact, some of the processes as well as the user interface of the marketplace are still relatively complicated for most people to use. The marketplace also lacks a few important features usually expected by either buyers or sellers on traditional online marketplaces. In reality, any significant amount of money invested towards aggressive user adoption campaigns would more than likely result in a poor user adoption rates simply due to the earliness of Particl’s product. Getting people to peek around is one thing, getting them to become Particl marketplace users is another thing entirely.</p><p><strong>Some of the reasons are also external to Particl</strong>. For example, the more than two-year-long cryptocurrency “bear market” surely hasn’t really encouraged long-term cryptocurrency holders to spend their coins the same way a “bull market” would…</p><h2 id=\"a-new-roadmap-is-on-the-way\">A New Roadmap is on the Way</h2><p>The very good news is that the Particl team is very aware of its marketplace’s bottlenecks! With Market Management, a very major marketplace update, coming out in a few weeks, it will mark the completion of a very high-level overview of what the marketplace was initially imagined to be — an open eCommerce network populated by an infinite amount of markets. In other words, the release of Market Management marks the end of a very particular development phase for the project.</p><p>That being said, that also means that it marks the very beginning of a new development phase, one that will be all about building the right features and tools for its targeted users. This new phase will also be all about increasing the marketplace’s accessibility, ease of use, and user interface as much as possible. <strong>In simple terms, this new phase is all about eliminating any reason why most people would not buy and/or sell on Particl.</strong></p><h3 id=\"buckle-up-\">Buckle Up!</h3><p>In the next few days, multiple blog posts will be published on <a href=\"http://Particl.news\"><strong>Particl.news</strong></a>. They will be a deep dive into the marketplace’s current status, its level of adoption, and current bottlenecks. They will also explain, in detail, the reasoning behind the Particl team’s strategy moving forward as it jumps in this new decade with both feet. <strong>This mini blog post series will ultimately culminate with the exciting reveal of the new Particl roadmap! </strong>Get ready, as the new roadmap is more than likely to blow a few people’s minds! ?</p><hr><p>The Particl team would love to thank you all for being part of this very special project and wishes you a very fruitful new decade.

Keep in mind it doesn’t even include Particl Core releases! ?</p><p>Indeed, one particularly impressive aspect of Particl’s development is how <strong>it always keeps its codebase up-to-date with the latest Bitcoin codebase version</strong>. That’s to ensure Particl’s base layer benefits from all the latest Bitcoin improvements so that it can remain secure and can easily integrate any innovation happening in Bitcoin’s world. Put simply, an up-to-date codebase means <strong>security</strong>, <strong>reliability</strong>, <strong>performance</strong>, and <strong>compatibility</strong>.</p><p>And while “keeping the codebase up-to-date” may initially sound like a simple and almost robotic task, there’s definitely a reason barely any Bitcoin-based “altcoin”, if any, properly keeps its codebase up-to-date — it’s a tedious and quite complicated task. That’s because the upstream Bitcoin code needs to be made to fit and be compatible with any added component to Particl’s codebase. It couldn’t further from a simple “copy-paste process”…</p><p>This year, this translated into <strong>19 individual core releases</strong>, a true testament to the constant hard work put in by Particl’s Core Developer &#x26; Cryptographic Researcher <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert\"><strong>Tecnovert</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"particl-core-releases-19-total-\">Particl Core Releases (19 total)</h3><ul><li>Jan. 1, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.0\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.0</strong></a></li><li>Feb. 6, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.2\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.2</strong></a></li><li>Feb. 14, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.3\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.3</strong></a></li><li>Mar. 7, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.4\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.4</strong></a></li><li>May 9, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.7\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.7</strong></a></li><li>Jun. 4, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.8\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.8</strong></a></li><li>Jun. 24, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.10\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.10</strong></a></li><li>Jul. 2, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.11\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.11</strong></a></li><li>Jul. 18, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.12\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.12</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 4, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.0\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.0</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 8, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.1\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.1</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 12, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.2\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.2</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 22, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.3\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.3</strong></a></li><li>Sep. 3, 2019 —<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.4\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.4</strong></a></li><li>Sep. 26, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.5\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.5</strong></a></li><li>Oct. 29, 2019 —<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1rc2\"> <strong>Particl Core 0.19.0.1 RC2 (Pre-Release)</strong></a></li><li>Oct. 31, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.6\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.6</strong></a></li><li>Dec. 4, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.7\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.7 (Pre-Release)</strong></a></li><li>Dec. 3, 2019 —<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1\"><strong>Particl Core 0.19.0.1 (Pre-Release)</strong></a></li></ul><hr><h2 id=\"particl-around-the-world\">Particl Around the World</h2><p>Another great move by Particl in 2019 was to increase its boots-on-the-ground presence by attending, sponsoring, and presenting at several blockchain conferences, events, and meetups all around the world.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-2019-Year-in-Review/1-Gbg9aHfYJ9bhiThjAvvKwQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Some of Particl’s team after SFBW’s Epicenter conference</figcaption></figure><p>Blockchain events are ideal networking opportunities for teams to find each other, build relationships, and start collaborating on multiple fronts.

More importantly, 2019 will forever be the year where private, free, and borderless eCommerce became a reality for everyone. A very important milestone in human commerce’s history when you think of it…</p><p>It’s also a year where it became obvious that simply pushing innovative and unique blockchain code just doesn’t cut it alone for a project to see great success and get decent exposure. And that’s okay, even great, because it signals that the industry is becoming more mature and wants to see blockchain products finally get some “real-world adoption”. That’s the metaphorical “blockchain killer product”, and <strong>that’s precisely why Particl is bound to shine moving forward!</strong></p><p>In fact, the Open Marketplace is a unique offering — it offers <strong>unmatched privacy in eCommerce</strong> and <strong>allows sellers and buyers to connect directly and safely transact by paying almost no fee at all</strong>. It takes third-parties (marketplace operator, payment processor, web host, etc) totally out of the eCommerce process and secures the user’s data and personal information at every step of the way, a perk that’s definitely becoming more and more valuable in <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/08/20/data-breaches-expose-41-billion-records-in-first-six-months-of-2019/#59551d93bd54\"><strong>an era of ever-increasing data mining, breaches, and identity thefts</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"particl-s-adoption\">Particl’s Adoption</h3><p>Yet, the level of adoption of the marketplace is still relatively low at this moment, a surprising fact for some. That’s due to a few reasons both internal and external to Particl, and luckily none of these reasons should really sound the alarm bell.</p><p><strong>Some of these reasons are directly due to Particl itself</strong>. In fact, the Open Marketplace is still very much an <strong>early Beta software</strong> and is simply not ready for mass adoption just yet. After all, it more than clearly says so in the marketplace’s header banner on Particl Desktop.</p><p>As a matter of fact, some of the processes as well as the user interface of the marketplace are still relatively complicated for most people to use. The marketplace also lacks a few important features usually expected by either buyers or sellers on traditional online marketplaces. In reality, any significant amount of money invested towards aggressive user adoption campaigns would more than likely result in a poor user adoption rates simply due to the earliness of Particl’s product. Getting people to peek around is one thing, getting them to become Particl marketplace users is another thing entirely.</p><p><strong>Some of the reasons are also external to Particl</strong>. For example, the more than two-year-long cryptocurrency “bear market” surely hasn’t really encouraged long-term cryptocurrency holders to spend their coins the same way a “bull market” would…</p><h2 id=\"a-new-roadmap-is-on-the-way\">A New Roadmap is on the Way</h2><p>The very good news is that the Particl team is very aware of its marketplace’s bottlenecks! With Market Management, a very major marketplace update, coming out in a few weeks, it will mark the completion of a very high-level overview of what the marketplace was initially imagined to be — an open eCommerce network populated by an infinite amount of markets. In other words, the release of Market Management marks the end of a very particular development phase for the project.</p><p>That being said, that also means that it marks the very beginning of a new development phase, one that will be all about building the right features and tools for its targeted users. This new phase will also be all about increasing the marketplace’s accessibility, ease of use, and user interface as much as possible. <strong>In simple terms, this new phase is all about eliminating any reason why most people would not buy and/or sell on Particl.</strong></p><h3 id=\"buckle-up-\">Buckle Up!</h3><p>In the next few days, multiple blog posts will be published on <a href=\"http://Particl.news\"><strong>Particl.news</strong></a>. They will be a deep dive into the marketplace’s current status, its level of adoption, and current bottlenecks. They will also explain, in detail, the reasoning behind the Particl team’s strategy moving forward as it jumps in this new decade with both feet. <strong>This mini blog post series will ultimately culminate with the exciting reveal of the new Particl roadmap! </strong>Get ready, as the new roadmap is more than likely to blow a few people’s minds! ?</p><hr><p>The Particl team would love to thank you all for being part of this very special project and wishes you a very fruitful new decade.

No, it’s instead been carefully monitoring\nthe community for feedback and comments regarding the overall user experience of\nthis first live version of the marketplace and has started working on several\nfeatures that are soon going to make their way onto the marketplace. It’s\nimportant to remind ourselves that this version of the Open Marketplace is an\nearly Beta version and is in no way the “end” of anything for Particl. Quite to\nthe contrary, it is the beginning of a great journey in disrupting one of the\nbiggest economic sector of the world— the eCommerce sector.\n\nIt’s been mentioned in the past that, as the Open Marketplace goes live on\nmainnet, it would signify a gradual change of phase for the project. Whereas\nParticl used to be almost exclusively focused on development, getting a live\nproduct means user adoption will now play a more important role. After all, this\nproject has always been about building a product that people could use to\naddress real-world issues. It has always been about creating a solution that\nempowers individuals and enables businesses to reach their full potential. And\nnow that the solution is here, it’s time to get people to use it and benefit\nfrom its groundbreaking technology.\n\nNow it’s Adoption Time!\nEver since the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace, the Particl team has\nreceived a huge amount of feedback and comments about the overall user\nexperience. And it is this user experience, the feeling you get when using the\nmarketplace, that is critical in getting new people and businesses to use\nParticl. It is one of the key factors in determining the “user conversion rate”,\nor the number of people that become recurring users after trying out the\nmarketplace for the first time.\n\nIndeed, getting new people to try out the marketplace is one thing, but\nretaining them as users is a whole other story. Most of the time, people are\nmore than willing to sacrifice their data and even pay higher prices if the user\nexperience is better elsewhere. And besides, you also get one chance at first\nimpressions.\n\nFor this reason, the new Open Marketplace development roadmap will now be\nheavily focused on building what needs to be done to make the user experience as\ngood and as accessible as possible. In other words, each new marketplace feature\nreleased within the next few weeks and months will directly contribute in making\nthe user experience better, thus increasing the user conversion rate and\nallowing more sellers and buyers to be onboarded.\n\nWhat are the Current Barriers to Entry\nSince the ultimate goal of the Open Marketplace is to empower individuals and\nbusinesses on a global scale, it’s important to identify what are the current\nbarriers to entry for anyone to start using the marketplace. After that, it’s\ncrucial to identify what can be done about it and then act on it.\n\nBy definition, a barrier to entry is an obstacle or hindrance that makes it hard\nto adopt a new product. This obstacle can be a technological challenge,\ndifficult government regulations, a steep financial cost, a lack of education\nabout a topic, and etc. In the Open Marketplace’s case, the barriers to entry\nare mostly technological, financial, and educational.\n\nThat much is made quite obvious when you start to go over the list of the most\nreported issues, comments, and feedback regarding the user experience of the\nmarketplace since it’s been released on mainnet. When all summarized, most of it\ncan be boiled down to a few main barriers to entry that makes it a bit\nchallenging for buyers and sellers to adopt the platform. Some of the most\nreported user experience issues include:\n\n * The setup process of the marketplace (it has to be manually enabled) could be\n   improved (technological barrier)\n * Listing fees being too high for large-scale sellers (financial barrier)\n * The double deposit MAD escrow requires a security deposit from both sides \n   (financial barrier)\n * There is no branding or identification option for vendors (technological\n   barrier)\n * The marketplace currently only accepts the PART coin and not Bitcoin, other\n   cryptocurrencies, or more traditional means of payment (technological\n   barrier)\n * The entire blockchain and SMSG network needs to be synced, which takes a few\n   minutes to do (technological barrier)\n * What needs to be done to complete a certain action isn’t always perfectly\n   clear (educational barrier)\n * How funds move throughout a full transaction process (educational barrier)\n\nThese barriers to entry are the main obstacles that make it harder for Particl\nto be adopted to a wider level. As such, solutions to these issues will be\nprioritized moving forward, and each item contained within the Open Marketplace\ndevelopment roadmap for the next few months is designed to increase the adoption\nof the Open Marketplace by improving the user experience.\n\nMake Particl as Accessible as Any Other Marketplace\nTo eliminate the barriers that make the Open Marketplace hard to adopt for most\npeople, the Particl team has planned and started working on several improvements\nand features. Each of them is designed to feed off each other and directly\ncontribute to improving Particl’s user experience for both buyers and sellers.\n\nWhat follows is an estimated release timeline of the next few features that are\ngoing to make their way onto Particl’s Open Marketplace. There’s currently no\ndate or time estimate associated with any of these features, but they’re what’s\nbeing worked on at this moment and what is planned to be released in the short\nto mid-term.\n\n> Note: This development timeline is only an estimation of the order at which\nfeatures will be released live on mainnet. All listed items are subject to\nchange.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Coming Up for Particl?\n * User Interface Tweaks\n * Lowering Marketplace Fees\n * Product Import Tool (1)\n * Q&A Section — Ask a Question to a Seller (2)\n * Particl Desktop Settings Page (3)\n * Market Management Tool (4)\n * Adjustable Escrow Ratio (5)\n * Inventory and Quantity Management Tool (6)\n * Then What?\n   Alternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments\n   Mobile Application\n   Developer SDK Tools\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUser Interface Tweaks\nImproved Sell Orders Page (Work-in-Progress)The lowest hanging fruit for\nimpoving Particl’s user experience is by making several tweaks to the user\ninterface of Particl Desktop, the client on which the Open Marketplace is\nhosted. These tweaks are currently being worked on based on user feedback and\nwill make using Particl much easier, especially for those who haven’t used it in\nthe past. These improvements and additions will also display more information to\nbuyers and sellers, making it easier to track what’s happening within the client\n(i.e. why funds are moving around, or at what time has a certain transaction\nbeen locked into escrow, and etc).\n\nLowering Marketplace Fees\nOne of the most reported issue with the Open Marketplace is the cost of listing\nan item. As the marketplace is fully autonomous and isn’t being operated by any\nthird-party, it charges no commission, subscription, payment processing, or\nescrow fee at all. It does, however, charge a small listing fee to fight off\nspam on the network.\n\nIn fact, when listing an item, the network usually charges sellers with a few\ncents worth of PART every day. And while it isn’t that big of a deal for any\nseller making a few sales here and there on their listings, especially given the\nfact that no commission is being charged on top of sales, it can quickly add up\nfor some of the smaller scale vendors who struggle to make sales and sellers\nwith huge inventories (hundreds/thousands of listings).\n\nAdjusting Marketplace Listing Fees on the Partyman AppFortunately, you can\nactually contribute to making this listing fee smaller. The Particl team has\npublished on their blog a full tutorial\n[https://particl.news/adjusting-listing-fees-4b676e230601] on how to instruct\nyour staking node to broadcast a request for lower fees to the SMSG network.\nSMSG is the network on which marketplace-related content is published and\nhosted.\n\nAdditionally, the Particl team is in the process of improving and optimizing the\nSMSG network. It is estimated that the marketplace fees (i.e. listing fees) will\nsignificantly be lowered due to the more effective SMSG codebase.\n\nThese changes will come gradually within the Beta phase of development of the\nmarketplace as updates get pushed.\n\nProduct Import Tool\nProduct Import Tool (Work-in-Progress)One of the key components of a two-sided\nmarketplace is getting a good amount of sellers and listed products. This is why\nthe new Particl Open Marketplace roadmap for the next few months includes a lot\nof tools that will make it easier for sellers to adopt the platform.\n\nOne such tool is the Product Import tool. This tool allows vendors to quickly\nimport large inventories from other sources, considerably reducing the time it\ntakes to populate the marketplace when holding custody of large inventories.\nWithout this feature, sellers need to manually add listings one by one, which is\na very time-consuming process.\n\nWith this feature in place, sellers are going to be able to import and list\nlarge inventories with only a few clicks. Outside sources for inventory\nimportation will include WooCommerce stores and CSV files (spreadsheets). More\noptions are very likely to be added in the future.\n\nQ&A Section — Ask a Question to a Seller\nBut a two-sided marketplace being a two-sided marketplace, it also needs a good\namount of buyers so that it can reach its full potential. This is where the\nupcoming Q&A section comes into play.\n\nThis “comment section” will allow anyone to ask questions to vendors before\npurchasing (or flagging) a product. This isn’t unlike the very popular Q&A\nsection that Amazon has had for some time now, and it goes a great way into\ngiving you information that might be missing from the item’s description.\n\nThis feature, while not a direct line of contact with the seller, will help\nbuyers make more informed purchasing decisions and give a little bit more\nconfidence when buying an item from a complete stranger. The more you know, the\nbetter decisions one can make.\n\nParticl Desktop Settings Page\nThe Particl Desktop Settings page is a no-brainer. Currently, if you want to\nchange a configuration on your Particl Desktop client, you either have to modify\nsome config file or enter some command inside the console. This works, but since\nthe goal is to make Particl’s user experience as good as possible, it’s\ndefinitely not as user-friendly as it should be.\n\nThe Settings page is pretty much what you would expect from a…settings page. It\nallows you to change various preferences without having to go through the hassle\nof finding a tutorial on how to find and modify a config file, or find a list of\ncommands to enter in the console.\n\nMarket Management Tool\nThe Market Management tool is one of the most awaited features of the Open\nMarketplace, and rightly so. It is what’s going to make all the individual\npieces of the marketplace click together and form into a giant distributed\nnetwork of markets.\n\nSelect What Market (or Storefront) to Browse (Work-in-Progress)Market Management\nwill allow you to either create a market of your own or connect your client to a\npre-existing one. These community markets can be created by anyone and are\ncompletely independent of the main interface of the Open Marketplace. In fact,\nthey are powered by completely different sets of market keys, meaning no data\ncan be shared between the different markets. It’s like multi-wallets, but more\nadvanced and for markets.\n\nOn Particl, there are two types of markets: community markets, and storefronts.\n\nCommunity Markets: They are markets on which anyone that has access to it can\nbuy or sell goods and services. They function exactly the same as the main\ninterface of the Open Marketplace, and nobody has any special permission over\nother users. Not even the market creator. These markets, however, are not\nenabled nor visible by default. To access these markets, you need to connect\nyour Particl Desktop client to its Market ID.\n\n> Note: The main interface of the Open Marketplace is a community market that’s\nenabled and displayed by default by the Particl Desktop client.\nJoined Markets (and Storefronts) Page (Work-in-Progress)Storefronts: They are customizable community markets on which special\npermissions can be attributed to various users. In their most common sense, they\nare storefronts on which a seller can “set up a shop” in such a way that only\nhim (or the people he gives administrator rights to) can publish listings.\nAnyone with access to a storefront can only buy (or flag) the listings put on\nthere by the owner of the storefront. Storefronts can also be used by\ncommunities looking for higher standards in quality on which only vetted sellers\ncould publish listings.\n\n> Note: By default, Particl Desktop has no way to automatically find Market IDs on\nthe network. These keys need to be distributed manually by whoever wants people\nto interact with a certain market or storefront…unless these markets/storefronts\nget promoted.\nPromote a Market or Storefront (Work-in-Progress)While Particl Desktop cannot\nautomatically scan and detect community markets, it is still possible to promote\nyour market to the network, for a fee. When “promoting” your market (or\nstorefront), your Particl Desktop client broadcasts the Market ID of your market\nto the network using SMSG. It is then picked up by the other clients connected\nto the Particl network, and is added to a “market browser”. At this point, a\nmarket will act just like a listing. It will show up on the market browser for\nthe amount of time it’s been promoted. Once the promotion period ends, the\nmarket disappears from the market browser.\n\n> Note: Once a market or storefront disappears from the market browser, it is\nstill accessible to anyone with its Market ID. The only difference is that it\nwon’t be publicly accessible from the market browser itself.\nAnyone with the proper Market IDs of a market or storefront can promote it. All\nthe fees paid to bump/promote community markets are, just like the listing fees,\nredistributed to stakers.\n\nCreate a New Storefront With Logo (Work-in-Progress)Storefronts are ideal for\nsellers with an already established reputation. It allows them to guarantee to\ntheir customer base that a given market, thus all products published inside of\nit, belongs to him. This can easily be done by, for example, displaying the\nMarket ID of the storefront on the seller’s official website.\n\nAdditionally, storefronts allow for a minimal amount of customization/branding\n(logo, store description, store title) and aggregate all the listings of a\nvendor to a single point of access This makes it easier and quicker for\ncustomers to find what they’re looking for, when they need it.\n\nAdjustable Escrow Ratio\nAs it stands right now, Particl’s double deposit MAD escrow system only works\nusing a 100% ratio, meaning both parties need to deposit a security deposit\nequal to 100% of the value of the item or service being purchased. There’s\nnothing wrong with that, of course. After all, a 100% ratio does provide the\nbest game-theory for this type of escrow. There might, however, be some\ncircumstances where such an escrow system wouldn’t be ideal.\n\nTake the example of a well-known seller that’s already trusted by its customer\nbase and runs a storefront on Particl. This seller might want to move some of\nits inventory on Particl to save on fees and improve the level of privacy for\nhis business as well as his customers. But since that seller is already\nwell-known and has an established customer base, it might not be ideal for both\nthe seller and its customer to front funds in order to cover a double deposit\nMAD escrow smart-contract. There is already trust that’s been established\nbetween the two parties and, since the seller is running a Particl storefront,\nhe can prove ownership of the products being offered simply by spreading his\nMarket ID on his website or social media pages. In that situation, the required\nsecurity deposits become an unnecessary obstacle for both the seller and the\nbuyer as they do not necessarily require, or want, escrow protection for\ntransactions.\n\nWhat an adjustable escrow would mean is that vendors could set up their own\nescrow ratio preferences from 0% to 100%. In the above example of a well-known\nseller running a Particl storefront, he could just reduce his escrow ratio to\n0%, meaning no security deposit would be required from neither the buyer or the\nvendor. This, of course, means that buyers would have no recourse against a\ndishonest seller, but for those already-established sellers with an existing\ncustomer base, having the opportunity to not have to advance coins to fund the\nescrow system would make adopting Particl’s Open Marketplace much more of a\nno-brainer.\n\nInventory and Quantity Management Tool\nThis feature is self-explanatory. There is no way, currently, to manage a wide\ninventory and add quantities to your listing. Fortunately, the marketplace\nback-end currently allows for most of it, but it hasn’t been integrated into the\nOpen Marketplace just yet. Note that a relatively fair amount of development is\nstill needed around this feature and it is likely to be released after the\nMarket Management tool.\n\nThis tool, like its name implies, allows vendors to easily manage inventory\nquantities, manage multiple listings, and etc. Just like the Product Import\ntool, Inventory Management is going to make it way easier for sellers with large\ninventories to take the leap and get started selling on Particl without it being\na big hassle.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThen What?\nAll of the above-mentioned items are placed into a short to mid-term roadmap,\nmeaning they are likely to be released within the next few weeks and months,\ndepending on the feature. But wait, there’s more to it!\n\nThe Particl team is thinking ahead and has already planned and started doing\nresearch on the features that are going to be worked on once the above\nmarketplace development roadmap is completed.\n\nAlternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments\nOne of the barriers to entry for Particl’s Open Marketplace currently is that it\nonly works with PART, Particl’s native privacy coin. This, of course, is due to\nthe nature of the technology and how the marketplace has to use PART for its\nprivacy and smart-contract capabilities\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd]. If it\nwere using Bitcoin, not only would transactions take a considerably longer time\ndue to longer confirmations, but the marketplace wouldn’t be able to offer a\nprivate-by-default experience to its users. And if it were using Monero, it\nwould be okay on the privacy side of things, but then the coin couldn’t be used\nwithin smart-contracts. The PART coin is a next-generation privacy coin that\nhas\nboth a solid privacy scheme and a flexible codebase\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd] which\nallows it to be used within smart-contracts. As far as privacy coins come, it’s\npretty much getting your cake and eating it too! The good stuff…without the\nlimitations.\n\nBut in the end, people want an easy-to-use marketplace with good user\nexperience, and only accepting PART severely limits the number of new users that\ncan be onboarded (that’s because everybody uses Bitcoin, mostly). To address\nthis issue, the Particl team is going to be working on integrating alternative\nmethods of payments, like paying with Bitcoin, for example.\n\nThere are a couple of ways this can be done, either through an atomic swap\nwidget or by integrating a third-party partner. And while the Particl team would\nlike to use an atomic swap solution (research and development on the matter is\nongoing at this very moment), a third-party integration might have to be coded\nin until an atomic swap application is fully ready (and thoroughly tested) to\ngo. There are currently investigations going into this question specifically,\nand so more details will be able to be communicated in the future.\n\nIt’s important to note though that, regardless of the method chosen to accept\ndifferent payment methods, the PART coin will always be the coin that settles\nthe transaction in the end. That’s because even though Particl’s Open\nMarketplace would be accepting Bitcoin, the marketplace Dapp still needs PART to\noperate as it is the coin that gives it its privacy and smart-contract\ncapabilities. This means any non-PART payments will be automatically converted\ninto a PART transaction, in the background, on behalf of the user. The end\nresult is that the buyer pays with Bitcoin, and the Open Marketplace does all\nthe rest, transferring the Bitcoin into Particl to fuel the escrow contract.\n\nMobile Application\nAnother very important upcoming feature is a Particl Open Marketplace mobile\napplication. Indeed, most people now shop on their cellphones, which means\ndownloading a software that requires you to sync two networks (blockchain +\nSMSG) is definitely a downgrade in terms of user experience. Sure, it provides\nway better privacy and decentralization, but for most people, this is too weak\nof an argument against a lazy and fast user-experience.\n\nAnd so, to address this issue, the Particl team has scheduled the development of\na mobile application. Research is already being put into this item at this very\nmoment, although it is not a top priority for the team right now. That’s because\nthere are still some core features missing to the marketplace (the items in the\nabove roadmap) that need to be added before the team can think of wrapping\neverything within a mobile application. Once the above roadmap is complete or\nnear-complete, that’s when the Open Marketplace’s mobile application is going to\nbecome more of a focus.\n\nThis mobile application will make Particl as accessible as it will have ever\nbeen. In fact, most of the world uses cellphones and more and more people now\nspend more time on their phone than on their computer. To make sure the\napplication has good performance and setup speed, it is more than likely to be a\n“light wallet”, meaning it won’t require you to download the entire blockchain\nand SMSG network to function. In other words, this application is intended to be\nas easy to use as any traditional marketplace mobile application (i.e. Amazon’s\napplication).\n\nDeveloper SDK Tools\nWith bringing more people within the Particl ecosystem in mind, the team has\nplanned for the release of an SDK tool. This tool will be accompanied by various\ntechnical documentation that is now currently missing. This will allow outside\ndevelopers and teams to easily start contributing to the Particl network by\ndeveloping services, decentralized applications, marketplace features, and etc.\n\nBecause the Open Marketplace is still very much into a heavy development phase,\nthis SDK tool is likely to be one of the last items of this article to see the\nday. With this in mind, the SDK tool will be going live once the Particl code\ngets “stable enough” so that it makes sense to commit to a version and write\ndocumentation on it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet’s Wrap it Up\nAll of the above-mentioned features that are going to be added to Particl have\none thing in common — they are part of a bigger puzzle that’s gonna make the\nOpen Marketplace much more accessible and easy to use for everyone. They all\ncontribute to eliminate the current barriers to entry that makes adopting\nParticl more complicated for most people.\n\nOnce in place, these should take Particl to the next level, making it a much\nmore credible contender for mainstream adoption. In the meantime, Particl\npioneers such as you can still buy and sell anything for crypto, without leaving\na trace, using the current version of the Open Marketplace. And since the\nmarketplace is now live on mainnet, new features and improvements can be\nexpected to come out at an accelerated pace!\n\nParticl is now well on its way on the path towards mainstream adoption. The\ndevelopment team is now a well-oiled machine and is excited to enter this new\nphase for the Particl project. The base layer is there, now it’s all about\nputting the last pieces to the puzzle together. This is where it gets exciting\nand when it starts moving faster!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-r41YvsRXOJyeVDkN_GcTqg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"new-marketplace-development-update-roadmap\">New Marketplace Development Update &amp; Roadmap</h3><p>It has now been more than 2 weeks since the Particl Open Marketplace has launched on mainnet.

And while it isn’t that big of a deal for any seller making a few sales here and there on their listings, especially given the fact that no commission is being charged on top of sales, it can quickly add up for some of the smaller scale vendors who struggle to make sales and sellers with huge inventories (hundreds/thousands of listings).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-OLpQIvxuczEzoa_flsWpfw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Adjusting Marketplace Listing Fees on the Partyman App</figcaption></figure><p>Fortunately, you can actually contribute to making this listing fee smaller. <a href=\"https://particl.news/adjusting-listing-fees-4b676e230601\"><strong>The Particl team has published on their blog a full tutorial</strong></a> on how to instruct your staking node to broadcast a request for lower fees to the SMSG network.

This is why the new Particl Open Marketplace roadmap for the next few months includes a lot of tools that will make it easier for sellers to adopt the platform.</p><p>One such tool is the Product Import tool. This tool allows vendors to quickly import large inventories from other sources, considerably reducing the time it takes to populate the marketplace when holding custody of large inventories. Without this feature, sellers need to manually add listings one by one, which is a very time-consuming process.</p><p>With this feature in place, sellers are going to be able to import and list large inventories with only a few clicks.

More options are very likely to be added in the future.</p><h3 id=\"qa-section-ask-a-question-to-a-seller\">Q&amp;A Section — Ask a Question to a Seller</h3><p>But a two-sided marketplace being a two-sided marketplace, it also needs a good amount of buyers so that it can reach its full potential. This is where the upcoming Q&amp;A section comes into play.</p><p>This “comment section” will allow anyone to ask questions to vendors before purchasing (or flagging) a product. This isn’t unlike the very popular Q&amp;A section that Amazon has had for some time now, and it goes a great way into giving you information that might be missing from the item’s description.</p><p>This feature, while not a direct line of contact with the seller, will help buyers make more informed purchasing decisions and give a little bit more confidence when buying an item from a complete stranger. The more you know, the better decisions one can make.</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-settings-page\">Particl Desktop Settings Page</h3><p>The Particl Desktop Settings page is a no-brainer. Currently, if you want to change a configuration on your Particl Desktop client, you either have to modify some config file or enter some command inside the console. This works, but since the goal is to make Particl’s user experience as good as possible, it’s definitely not as user-friendly as it should be.</p><p>The Settings page is pretty much what you would expect from a…settings page. It allows you to change various preferences without having to go through the hassle of finding a tutorial on how to find and modify a config file, or find a list of commands to enter in the console.</p><h3 id=\"market-management-tool\">Market Management Tool</h3><p>The Market Management tool is one of the most awaited features of the Open Marketplace, and rightly so. It is what’s going to make all the individual pieces of the marketplace click together and form into a giant distributed network of markets.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-sQWfEk-U6lWzv8ijSfJBng.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Select What Market (or Storefront) to Browse (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>Market Management will allow you to either create a market of your own or connect your client to a pre-existing one. These community markets can be created by anyone and are completely independent of the main interface of the Open Marketplace. In fact, they are powered by completely different sets of market keys, meaning no data can be shared between the different markets. It’s like multi-wallets, but more advanced and for markets.</p><p>On Particl, there are two types of markets: community markets, and storefronts.</p><p><strong>Community Markets:</strong> They are markets on which anyone that has access to it can buy or sell goods and services. They function exactly the same as the main interface of the Open Marketplace, and nobody has any special permission over other users. Not even the market creator. These markets, however, are not enabled nor visible by default. To access these markets, you need to connect your Particl Desktop client to its Market ID.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> The main interface of the Open Marketplace is a community market that’s enabled and displayed by default by the Particl Desktop client.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-Gh6FqychOcQ2f49d-D_laA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Joined Markets (and Storefronts) Page (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Storefronts: </strong>They are customizable community markets on which special permissions can be attributed to various users. In their most common sense, they are storefronts on which a seller can “set up a shop” in such a way that only him (or the people he gives administrator rights to) can publish listings. Anyone with access to a storefront can only buy (or flag) the listings put on there by the owner of the storefront. Storefronts can also be used by communities looking for higher standards in quality on which only vetted sellers could publish listings.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> By default, Particl Desktop has no way to automatically find Market IDs on the network. These keys need to be distributed manually by whoever wants people to interact with a certain market or storefront…unless these markets/storefronts get promoted.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-xEOnXDjpfjoRMz-Gyasahg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Promote a Market or Storefront (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>While Particl Desktop cannot automatically scan and detect community markets, it is still possible to <strong>promote your market</strong> to the network, for a fee. When “promoting” your market (or storefront), your Particl Desktop client broadcasts the Market ID of your market to the network using SMSG. It is then picked up by the other clients connected to the Particl network, and is added to a “market browser”. At this point, a market will act just like a listing. It will show up on the market browser for the amount of time it’s been promoted. Once the promotion period ends, the market disappears from the market browser.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Once a market or storefront disappears from the market browser, it is still accessible to anyone with its Market ID. The only difference is that it won’t be publicly accessible from the market browser itself.</blockquote><p>Anyone with the proper Market IDs of a market or storefront can promote it. All the fees paid to bump/promote community markets are, just like the listing fees, redistributed to stakers.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-5utZ5LvZNv-3EOxW_ueeow.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Create a New Storefront With Logo (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>Storefronts are ideal for sellers with an already established reputation. It allows them to guarantee to their customer base that a given market, thus all products published inside of it, belongs to him. This can easily be done by, for example, displaying the Market ID of the storefront on the seller’s official website.</p><p>Additionally, storefronts allow for a minimal amount of customization/branding (logo, store description, store title) and aggregate all the listings of a vendor to a single point of access This makes it easier and quicker for customers to find what they’re looking for, when they need it.</p><h3 id=\"adjustable-escrow-ratio\">Adjustable Escrow Ratio</h3><p>As it stands right now, Particl’s double deposit MAD escrow system only works using a 100% ratio, meaning both parties need to deposit a security deposit equal to 100% of the value of the item or service being purchased. There’s nothing wrong with that, of course. After all, a 100% ratio does provide the best game-theory for this type of escrow. There might, however, be some circumstances where such an escrow system wouldn’t be ideal.</p><p>Take the example of a well-known seller that’s already trusted by its customer base and runs a storefront on Particl. This seller might want to move some of its inventory on Particl to save on fees and improve the level of privacy for his business as well as his customers. But since that seller is already well-known and has an established customer base, it might not be ideal for both the seller and its customer to front funds in order to cover a double deposit MAD escrow smart-contract. There is already trust that’s been established between the two parties and, since the seller is running a Particl storefront, he can prove ownership of the products being offered simply by spreading his Market ID on his website or social media pages. In that situation, the required security deposits become an unnecessary obstacle for both the seller and the buyer as they do not necessarily require, or want, escrow protection for transactions.</p><p>What an adjustable escrow would mean is that vendors could set up their own escrow ratio preferences from 0% to 100%. In the above example of a well-known seller running a Particl storefront, he could just reduce his escrow ratio to 0%, meaning no security deposit would be required from neither the buyer or the vendor. This, of course, means that buyers would have no recourse against a dishonest seller, but for those already-established sellers with an existing customer base, having the opportunity to not have to advance coins to fund the escrow system would make adopting Particl’s Open Marketplace much more of a no-brainer.</p><h3 id=\"inventory-and-quantity-management-tool\">Inventory and Quantity Management Tool</h3><p>This feature is self-explanatory. There is no way, currently, to manage a wide inventory and add quantities to your listing. Fortunately, the marketplace back-end currently allows for most of it, but it hasn’t been integrated into the Open Marketplace just yet. Note that a relatively fair amount of development is still needed around this feature and it is likely to be released after the Market Management tool.</p><p>This tool, like its name implies, allows vendors to easily manage inventory quantities, manage multiple listings, and etc. Just like the Product Import tool, Inventory Management is going to make it way easier for sellers with large inventories to take the leap and get started selling on Particl without it being a big hassle.</p><hr><h2 id=\"then-what\"><strong>Then What?</strong></h2><p>All of the above-mentioned items are placed into a short to mid-term roadmap, meaning they are likely to be released within the next few weeks and months, depending on the feature. But wait, there’s more to it!</p><p>The Particl team is thinking ahead and has already planned and started doing research on the features that are going to be worked on once the above marketplace development roadmap is completed.</p><h3 id=\"alternative-payment-options-bitcoin-payments\">Alternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments</h3><p>One of the barriers to entry for Particl’s Open Marketplace currently is that it only works with PART, Particl’s native privacy coin. This, of course, is due to the nature of the technology and how the marketplace has to use <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>PART for its privacy and smart-contract capabilities</strong></a>. If it were using Bitcoin, not only would transactions take a considerably longer time due to longer confirmations, but the marketplace wouldn’t be able to offer a private-by-default experience to its users. And if it were using Monero, it would be okay on the privacy side of things, but then the coin couldn’t be used within smart-contracts. The <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>PART coin is a next-generation privacy coin that has both a solid privacy scheme and a flexible codebase</strong></a> which allows it to be used within smart-contracts. As far as privacy coins come, it’s pretty much getting your cake and eating it too! The good stuff…without the limitations.</p><p>But in the end, people want an easy-to-use marketplace with good user experience, and only accepting PART severely limits the number of new users that can be onboarded (that’s because everybody uses Bitcoin, mostly). To address this issue, the Particl team is going to be working on integrating alternative methods of payments, like paying with Bitcoin, for example.</p><p>There are a couple of ways this can be done, either through an atomic swap widget or by integrating a third-party partner. And while the Particl team would like to use an atomic swap solution (research and development on the matter is ongoing at this very moment), a third-party integration might have to be coded in until an atomic swap application is fully ready (and thoroughly tested) to go. There are currently investigations going into this question specifically, and so more details will be able to be communicated in the future.</p><p>It’s important to note though that, regardless of the method chosen to accept different payment methods, the PART coin will always be the coin that settles the transaction in the end. That’s because even though Particl’s Open Marketplace would be accepting Bitcoin, the marketplace Dapp still needs PART to operate as it is the coin that gives it its privacy and smart-contract capabilities. This means any non-PART payments will be automatically converted into a PART transaction, in the background, on behalf of the user. The end result is that the buyer pays with Bitcoin, and the Open Marketplace does all the rest, transferring the Bitcoin into Particl to fuel the escrow contract.</p><h3 id=\"mobile-application\">Mobile Application</h3><p>Another very important upcoming feature is a Particl Open Marketplace mobile application. Indeed, most people now shop on their cellphones, which means downloading a software that requires you to sync two networks (blockchain + SMSG) is definitely a downgrade in terms of user experience. Sure, it provides way better privacy and decentralization, but for most people, this is too weak of an argument against a lazy and fast user-experience.</p><p>And so, to address this issue, the Particl team has scheduled the development of a mobile application. Research is already being put into this item at this very moment, although it is not a top priority for the team right now. That’s because there are still some core features missing to the marketplace (the items in the above roadmap) that need to be added before the team can think of wrapping everything within a mobile application. Once the above roadmap is complete or near-complete, that’s when the Open Marketplace’s mobile application is going to become more of a focus.</p><p>This mobile application will make Particl as accessible as it will have ever been. In fact, most of the world uses cellphones and more and more people now spend more time on their phone than on their computer. To make sure the application has good performance and setup speed, it is more than likely to be a “light wallet”, meaning it won’t require you to download the entire blockchain and SMSG network to function. In other words, this application is intended to be as easy to use as any traditional marketplace mobile application (i.e. Amazon’s application).</p><h3 id=\"developer-sdk-tools\">Developer SDK Tools</h3><p>With bringing more people within the Particl ecosystem in mind, the team has planned for the release of an SDK tool. This tool will be accompanied by various technical documentation that is now currently missing. This will allow outside developers and teams to easily start contributing to the Particl network by developing services, decentralized applications, marketplace features, and etc.</p><p>Because the Open Marketplace is still very much into a heavy development phase, this SDK tool is likely to be one of the last items of this article to see the day. With this in mind, the SDK tool will be going live once the Particl code gets “stable enough” so that it makes sense to commit to a version and write documentation on it.</p><hr><h2 id=\"let-s-wrap-it-up\">Let’s Wrap it Up</h2><p>All of the above-mentioned features that are going to be added to Particl have one thing in common — they are part of a bigger puzzle that’s gonna make the Open Marketplace much more accessible and easy to use for everyone. They all contribute to eliminate the current barriers to entry that makes adopting Particl more complicated for most people.</p><p>Once in place, these should take Particl to the next level, making it a much more credible contender for mainstream adoption. In the meantime, Particl pioneers such as you can still buy and sell anything for crypto, without leaving a trace, using the current version of the Open Marketplace. And since the marketplace is now live on mainnet, new features and improvements can be expected to come out at an accelerated pace!</p><p>Particl is now well on its way on the path towards mainstream adoption. The development team is now a well-oiled machine and is excited to enter this new phase for the Particl project. The base layer is there, now it’s all about putting the last pieces to the puzzle together. This is where it gets exciting and when it starts moving faster!</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-uAgpsfe9xDDVHe1pF6zJdg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure>","url":"http://localhost:2368/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"994d687a-0700-42af-9230-d514c67d48e9","codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5f7e4ca61a93b603e3f767b2","reading_time":16,"send_email_when_published":false,"email_subject":null,"childHtmlRehype":{"html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-r41YvsRXOJyeVDkN_GcTqg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><h3 id=\"new-marketplace-development-update-roadmap\">New Marketplace Development Update &#x26; Roadmap</h3><p>It has now been more than 2 weeks since the Particl Open Marketplace has launched on mainnet. This release has been a historic moment for the project and a huge stepping stone for the upcoming eCommerce revolution that Particl is brewing up.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-QjorfnMkAgAxEXVbGdPndw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl’s Open Marketplace Live on Mainnet ?</figcaption></figure><p>Since that time, the team has certainly not been taking it slow. No, it’s instead been carefully monitoring the community for feedback and comments regarding the overall user experience of this first live version of the marketplace and has started working on several features that are soon going to make their way onto the marketplace. It’s important to remind ourselves that this version of the Open Marketplace is an early Beta version and is in no way the “end” of anything for Particl. Quite to the contrary, it is the beginning of a great journey in disrupting one of the biggest economic sector of the world— the eCommerce sector.</p><p>It’s been mentioned in the past that, as the Open Marketplace goes live on mainnet, it would signify a gradual change of phase for the project. Whereas Particl used to be almost exclusively focused on development, getting a live product means user adoption will now play a more important role. After all, this project has always been about building a product that people could use to address <strong>real-world issues. </strong>It has always been about creating a solution that empowers individuals and enables businesses to reach their full potential. And now that the solution is here, it’s time to get people to use it and benefit from its groundbreaking technology.</p><h2 id=\"now-it-s-adoption-time-\">Now it’s Adoption Time!</h2><p>Ever since the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace, the Particl team has received a huge amount of feedback and comments about the overall user experience. And it is this user experience, the feeling you get when using the marketplace, that is critical in getting new people and businesses to use Particl. It is one of the key factors in determining the “user conversion rate”, or the number of people that become recurring users after trying out the marketplace for the first time.</p><p>Indeed, getting new people to try out the marketplace is one thing, but retaining them as users is a whole other story. Most of the time, people are more than willing to sacrifice their data and even pay higher prices if the user experience is better elsewhere. And besides, you also get one chance at first impressions.</p><p>For this reason, <strong>the new Open Marketplace development roadmap will now be heavily focused on building what needs to be done to make the user experience as good and as accessible as possible. </strong>In other words, each new marketplace feature released within the next few weeks and months will directly contribute in making the user experience better, thus increasing the user conversion rate and allowing more sellers and buyers to be onboarded.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-current-barriers-to-entry\">What are the Current Barriers to Entry</h2><p>Since the ultimate goal of the Open Marketplace is to empower individuals and businesses on a global scale, it’s important to identify what are the current barriers to entry for anyone to start using the marketplace. After that, it’s crucial to identify what can be done about it and then act on it.</p><p>By definition, a barrier to entry is an obstacle or hindrance that makes it hard to adopt a new product. This obstacle can be a technological challenge, difficult government regulations, a steep financial cost, a lack of education about a topic, and etc. In the Open Marketplace’s case, the barriers to entry are mostly <strong>technological</strong>, <strong>financial</strong>, and<strong> educational</strong>.</p><p>That much is made quite obvious when you start to go over the list of the most reported issues, comments, and feedback regarding the user experience of the marketplace since it’s been released on mainnet. When all summarized, most of it can be boiled down to a few main barriers to entry that makes it a bit challenging for buyers and sellers to adopt the platform. Some of the most reported user experience issues include:</p><ul><li>The setup process of the marketplace (it has to be manually enabled) could be improved <strong>(technological barrier)</strong></li><li>Listing fees being too high for large-scale sellers <strong>(financial barrier)</strong></li><li>The double deposit MAD escrow requires a security deposit from both sides <strong>(financial barrier)</strong></li><li>There is no branding or identification option for vendors <strong>(technological barrier)</strong></li><li>The marketplace currently only accepts the PART coin and not Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, or more traditional means of payment <strong>(technological barrier)</strong></li><li>The entire blockchain and SMSG network needs to be synced, which takes a few minutes to do<strong> (technological barrier)</strong></li><li>What needs to be done to complete a certain action isn’t always perfectly clear <strong>(educational barrier)</strong></li><li>How funds move throughout a full transaction process <strong>(educational barrier)</strong></li></ul><p>These barriers to entry are the main obstacles that make it harder for Particl to be adopted to a wider level. As such, solutions to these issues will be prioritized moving forward, and each item contained within the Open Marketplace development roadmap for the next few months is designed to increase the adoption of the Open Marketplace by improving the user experience.</p><h2 id=\"make-particl-as-accessible-as-any-other-marketplace\">Make Particl as Accessible as Any Other Marketplace</h2><p>To eliminate the barriers that make the Open Marketplace hard to adopt for most people, the Particl team has planned and started working on several improvements and features. Each of them is designed to feed off each other and directly contribute to improving Particl’s user experience for both buyers and sellers.</p><p>What follows is an estimated release timeline of the next few features that are going to make their way onto Particl’s Open Marketplace. There’s currently no date or time estimate associated with any of these features, but they’re what’s being worked on at this moment and what is planned to be released in the short to mid-term.</p><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>This development timeline is only an estimation of the order at which features will be released live on mainnet. All listed items are subject to change.</blockquote><hr><h3 id=\"what-s-coming-up-for-particl\">What’s Coming Up for Particl?</h3><ul><li><a href=\"#8c5a\"><strong>User Interface Tweaks</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"#5f27\"><strong>Lowering Marketplace Fees</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"#909d\"><strong>Product Import Tool</strong></a><strong> (1)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#3d73\"><strong>Q&#x26;A Section — Ask a Question to a Seller</strong></a><strong> (2)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#c8cb\"><strong>Particl Desktop Settings Page</strong></a><strong> (3)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#7168\"><strong>Market Management Tool</strong></a><strong> (4)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#e90f\"><strong>Adjustable Escrow Ratio</strong></a><strong> (5)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#3d2b\"><strong>Inventory and Quantity Management Tool</strong></a><strong> (6)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#5a71\"><strong>Then What?</strong></a><br><a href=\"#a7e1\">Alternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments</a><br><a href=\"#c75e\">Mobile Application</a><br><a href=\"#9733\">Developer SDK Tools</a></li></ul><hr><h3 id=\"user-interface-tweaks\">User Interface Tweaks</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-ZdZYzwxy3xJGIyMnGSbIwQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Improved Sell Orders Page (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>The lowest hanging fruit for impoving Particl’s user experience is by making several tweaks to the user interface of Particl Desktop, the client on which the Open Marketplace is hosted.

It allows you to change various preferences without having to go through the hassle of finding a tutorial on how to find and modify a config file, or find a list of commands to enter in the console.</p><h3 id=\"market-management-tool\">Market Management Tool</h3><p>The Market Management tool is one of the most awaited features of the Open Marketplace, and rightly so. It is what’s going to make all the individual pieces of the marketplace click together and form into a giant distributed network of markets.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-sQWfEk-U6lWzv8ijSfJBng.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Select What Market (or Storefront) to Browse (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>Market Management will allow you to either create a market of your own or connect your client to a pre-existing one. These community markets can be created by anyone and are completely independent of the main interface of the Open Marketplace. In fact, they are powered by completely different sets of market keys, meaning no data can be shared between the different markets. It’s like multi-wallets, but more advanced and for markets.</p><p>On Particl, there are two types of markets: community markets, and storefronts.</p><p><strong>Community Markets:</strong> They are markets on which anyone that has access to it can buy or sell goods and services. They function exactly the same as the main interface of the Open Marketplace, and nobody has any special permission over other users. Not even the market creator. These markets, however, are not enabled nor visible by default. To access these markets, you need to connect your Particl Desktop client to its Market ID.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> The main interface of the Open Marketplace is a community market that’s enabled and displayed by default by the Particl Desktop client.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-Gh6FqychOcQ2f49d-D_laA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Joined Markets (and Storefronts) Page (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Storefronts: </strong>They are customizable community markets on which special permissions can be attributed to various users. In their most common sense, they are storefronts on which a seller can “set up a shop” in such a way that only him (or the people he gives administrator rights to) can publish listings. Anyone with access to a storefront can only buy (or flag) the listings put on there by the owner of the storefront. Storefronts can also be used by communities looking for higher standards in quality on which only vetted sellers could publish listings.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> By default, Particl Desktop has no way to automatically find Market IDs on the network. These keys need to be distributed manually by whoever wants people to interact with a certain market or storefront…unless these markets/storefronts get promoted.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-xEOnXDjpfjoRMz-Gyasahg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Promote a Market or Storefront (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>While Particl Desktop cannot automatically scan and detect community markets, it is still possible to <strong>promote your market</strong> to the network, for a fee. When “promoting” your market (or storefront), your Particl Desktop client broadcasts the Market ID of your market to the network using SMSG. It is then picked up by the other clients connected to the Particl network, and is added to a “market browser”. At this point, a market will act just like a listing. It will show up on the market browser for the amount of time it’s been promoted. Once the promotion period ends, the market disappears from the market browser.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Once a market or storefront disappears from the market browser, it is still accessible to anyone with its Market ID. The only difference is that it won’t be publicly accessible from the market browser itself.</blockquote><p>Anyone with the proper Market IDs of a market or storefront can promote it. All the fees paid to bump/promote community markets are, just like the listing fees, redistributed to stakers.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-5utZ5LvZNv-3EOxW_ueeow.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Create a New Storefront With Logo (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>Storefronts are ideal for sellers with an already established reputation. It allows them to guarantee to their customer base that a given market, thus all products published inside of it, belongs to him. This can easily be done by, for example, displaying the Market ID of the storefront on the seller’s official website.</p><p>Additionally, storefronts allow for a minimal amount of customization/branding (logo, store description, store title) and aggregate all the listings of a vendor to a single point of access This makes it easier and quicker for customers to find what they’re looking for, when they need it.</p><h3 id=\"adjustable-escrow-ratio\">Adjustable Escrow Ratio</h3><p>As it stands right now, Particl’s double deposit MAD escrow system only works using a 100% ratio, meaning both parties need to deposit a security deposit equal to 100% of the value of the item or service being purchased. There’s nothing wrong with that, of course. After all, a 100% ratio does provide the best game-theory for this type of escrow. There might, however, be some circumstances where such an escrow system wouldn’t be ideal.</p><p>Take the example of a well-known seller that’s already trusted by its customer base and runs a storefront on Particl. This seller might want to move some of its inventory on Particl to save on fees and improve the level of privacy for his business as well as his customers. But since that seller is already well-known and has an established customer base, it might not be ideal for both the seller and its customer to front funds in order to cover a double deposit MAD escrow smart-contract. There is already trust that’s been established between the two parties and, since the seller is running a Particl storefront, he can prove ownership of the products being offered simply by spreading his Market ID on his website or social media pages. In that situation, the required security deposits become an unnecessary obstacle for both the seller and the buyer as they do not necessarily require, or want, escrow protection for transactions.</p><p>What an adjustable escrow would mean is that vendors could set up their own escrow ratio preferences from 0% to 100%. In the above example of a well-known seller running a Particl storefront, he could just reduce his escrow ratio to 0%, meaning no security deposit would be required from neither the buyer or the vendor. This, of course, means that buyers would have no recourse against a dishonest seller, but for those already-established sellers with an existing customer base, having the opportunity to not have to advance coins to fund the escrow system would make adopting Particl’s Open Marketplace much more of a no-brainer.</p><h3 id=\"inventory-and-quantity-management-tool\">Inventory and Quantity Management Tool</h3><p>This feature is self-explanatory. There is no way, currently, to manage a wide inventory and add quantities to your listing. Fortunately, the marketplace back-end currently allows for most of it, but it hasn’t been integrated into the Open Marketplace just yet. Note that a relatively fair amount of development is still needed around this feature and it is likely to be released after the Market Management tool.</p><p>This tool, like its name implies, allows vendors to easily manage inventory quantities, manage multiple listings, and etc. Just like the Product Import tool, Inventory Management is going to make it way easier for sellers with large inventories to take the leap and get started selling on Particl without it being a big hassle.</p><hr><h2 id=\"then-what\"><strong>Then What?</strong></h2><p>All of the above-mentioned items are placed into a short to mid-term roadmap, meaning they are likely to be released within the next few weeks and months, depending on the feature. But wait, there’s more to it!</p><p>The Particl team is thinking ahead and has already planned and started doing research on the features that are going to be worked on once the above marketplace development roadmap is completed.</p><h3 id=\"alternative-payment-options-bitcoin-payments\">Alternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments</h3><p>One of the barriers to entry for Particl’s Open Marketplace currently is that it only works with PART, Particl’s native privacy coin. This, of course, is due to the nature of the technology and how the marketplace has to use <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>PART for its privacy and smart-contract capabilities</strong></a>. If it were using Bitcoin, not only would transactions take a considerably longer time due to longer confirmations, but the marketplace wouldn’t be able to offer a private-by-default experience to its users. And if it were using Monero, it would be okay on the privacy side of things, but then the coin couldn’t be used within smart-contracts. The <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>PART coin is a next-generation privacy coin that has both a solid privacy scheme and a flexible codebase</strong></a> which allows it to be used within smart-contracts. As far as privacy coins come, it’s pretty much getting your cake and eating it too! The good stuff…without the limitations.</p><p>But in the end, people want an easy-to-use marketplace with good user experience, and only accepting PART severely limits the number of new users that can be onboarded (that’s because everybody uses Bitcoin, mostly). To address this issue, the Particl team is going to be working on integrating alternative methods of payments, like paying with Bitcoin, for example.</p><p>There are a couple of ways this can be done, either through an atomic swap widget or by integrating a third-party partner. And while the Particl team would like to use an atomic swap solution (research and development on the matter is ongoing at this very moment), a third-party integration might have to be coded in until an atomic swap application is fully ready (and thoroughly tested) to go. There are currently investigations going into this question specifically, and so more details will be able to be communicated in the future.</p><p>It’s important to note though that, regardless of the method chosen to accept different payment methods, the PART coin will always be the coin that settles the transaction in the end. That’s because even though Particl’s Open Marketplace would be accepting Bitcoin, the marketplace Dapp still needs PART to operate as it is the coin that gives it its privacy and smart-contract capabilities. This means any non-PART payments will be automatically converted into a PART transaction, in the background, on behalf of the user. The end result is that the buyer pays with Bitcoin, and the Open Marketplace does all the rest, transferring the Bitcoin into Particl to fuel the escrow contract.</p><h3 id=\"mobile-application\">Mobile Application</h3><p>Another very important upcoming feature is a Particl Open Marketplace mobile application. Indeed, most people now shop on their cellphones, which means downloading a software that requires you to sync two networks (blockchain + SMSG) is definitely a downgrade in terms of user experience. Sure, it provides way better privacy and decentralization, but for most people, this is too weak of an argument against a lazy and fast user-experience.</p><p>And so, to address this issue, the Particl team has scheduled the development of a mobile application. Research is already being put into this item at this very moment, although it is not a top priority for the team right now. That’s because there are still some core features missing to the marketplace (the items in the above roadmap) that need to be added before the team can think of wrapping everything within a mobile application. Once the above roadmap is complete or near-complete, that’s when the Open Marketplace’s mobile application is going to become more of a focus.</p><p>This mobile application will make Particl as accessible as it will have ever been. In fact, most of the world uses cellphones and more and more people now spend more time on their phone than on their computer. To make sure the application has good performance and setup speed, it is more than likely to be a “light wallet”, meaning it won’t require you to download the entire blockchain and SMSG network to function. In other words, this application is intended to be as easy to use as any traditional marketplace mobile application (i.e. Amazon’s application).</p><h3 id=\"developer-sdk-tools\">Developer SDK Tools</h3><p>With bringing more people within the Particl ecosystem in mind, the team has planned for the release of an SDK tool. This tool will be accompanied by various technical documentation that is now currently missing. This will allow outside developers and teams to easily start contributing to the Particl network by developing services, decentralized applications, marketplace features, and etc.</p><p>Because the Open Marketplace is still very much into a heavy development phase, this SDK tool is likely to be one of the last items of this article to see the day. With this in mind, the SDK tool will be going live once the Particl code gets “stable enough” so that it makes sense to commit to a version and write documentation on it.</p><hr><h2 id=\"let-s-wrap-it-up\">Let’s Wrap it Up</h2><p>All of the above-mentioned features that are going to be added to Particl have one thing in common — they are part of a bigger puzzle that’s gonna make the Open Marketplace much more accessible and easy to use for everyone. They all contribute to eliminate the current barriers to entry that makes adopting Particl more complicated for most people.</p><p>Once in place, these should take Particl to the next level, making it a much more credible contender for mainstream adoption. In the meantime, Particl pioneers such as you can still buy and sell anything for crypto, without leaving a trace, using the current version of the Open Marketplace. And since the marketplace is now live on mainnet, new features and improvements can be expected to come out at an accelerated pace!</p><p>Particl is now well on its way on the path towards mainstream adoption. The development team is now a well-oiled machine and is excited to enter this new phase for the Particl project. The base layer is there, now it’s all about putting the last pieces to the puzzle together. This is where it gets exciting and when it starts moving faster!</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-uAgpsfe9xDDVHe1pF6zJdg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":["kg-card","kg-image-card"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-r41YvsRXOJyeVDkN_GcTqg.jpeg","className":["kg-image"],"alt":""},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"new-marketplace-development-update-roadmap"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"New Marketplace Development Update & Roadmap"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"It has now been more than 2 weeks since the Particl Open Marketplace has launched on mainnet.
