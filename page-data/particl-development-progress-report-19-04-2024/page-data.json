for seamless and\npractical decentralized commerce solutions remains a driving force. Although\nthis is a self-evident use case for crypto, comprehensive solutions to use\ndecentralized money as money, without relying on heavily centralized\narchitecture, is lacking.\n\nWhile achieving this goal has proven challenging, this article explores how\nintegrating BasicSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) that offers Litecoin\npairs, into Particl Marketplace, a decentralized e-commerce platform, offers a\nsolution to overcome many user experience obstacles that have come to hinder the\nevolution of cryptocurrencies as a medium of payment.\n\nBy providing multi-currency support\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-integration-unlocking-currency-agnostic-commerce-on-particl/] \nto the decentralized e-commerce ecosystem, this upcoming integration offers a\ntangible path forward for many coins, unlocking the potential for widespread\ncryptocurrency usage in everyday retail transactions.\n\nWith this in mind, Litecoin, with its focused push as a payment currency, serves\nas the perfect candidate to illustrate this transformative potential, allowing\nanyone to use Litecoin for shopping.\n\nLitecoin; Faster and Cheaper Transactions\nLitecoin has garnered significant attention for its faster transaction times and\nlower fees compared to Bitcoin – a stark contrast to the latter's reputation for\nsluggish and costly processing. This, from the beginning, has positioned\nLitecoin as an ideal cryptocurrency for payments and commerce. Recognizing its\nstrengths in speed and affordability, the Litecoin community has been actively\npromoting its adoption as a practical and viable payment solution for years now.\n\nLitecoin MWEB and Privacy: Solidifying Litecoin as True Digital Cash\nLitecoin's MWEB (MimbleWimble Extension Blocks) introduces a significant\nimprovement to an already payment-friendly digital currency: transactional\nprivacy. This brings confidential transactions and privacy features to the\nLitecoin network, a pivotal development poised to solidify its positioning as\ntrue digital cash and a viable currency for payments.\n\nPrivacy is, of course, a crucial aspect in the realm of digital payments, as it\nsafeguards users' and businesses' financial information and promotes fungibility\n– a fundamental characteristic of sound money.\n\nParticl Marketplace: Redefining Decentralized E-Commerce\nWhile transactional privacy is paramount, it is also crucial for the platform\nfacilitating such payments to uphold privacy as well.\n\nEnvision this scenario: you send a private payment using Litecoin MWEB or even\nMonero to purchase an item online. However, you later discover that this\nplatform has been collecting user data and subsequently fell victim to a data\nbreach, exposing your shipping information, shopping history, along with\naddresses and payment details to an attacker. An absolute nightmare, even if the\ninitial payment was conducted through a private transaction.\n\nThis underscores the fact that private payments alone are insufficient to\ncompletely safeguard your shopping habits and selling history. This fact stands\nas a premise for the design of Particl Marketplace.\n\nParticl Marketplace is a decentralized, privacy-focused e-commerce platform\nbuilt using blockchain and peer-to-peer technology. Unlike traditional\ne-commerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, Etsy, or Alibaba, Particl Marketplace\noperates without intermediaries, ensuring secure and private transactions\nbetween users, free from fees or restrictions. Buyers and sellers transact\ndirectly, benefiting from a two-party escrow system that protects both parties\nand keeps all trade information private to the involved parties only.\n\nUsing Litecoin for Shopping on Particl Marketplace Soon to be AvailableWhile the\nplatform's unapologetically decentralized nature and privacy features make it an\nattractive alternative to centralized e-commerce platforms (which often face\ncensorship, data breaches, and other vulnerabilities), it is currently limited\nto using PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, as the settlement currency. This\nis due to PART’s unique technology being an integral component in enabling some\nof the marketplace's unique features in the first place.\n\nBasicSwap DEX: Enabling Multi-Currency Payments\nLitecoin MWEB Balances and Conversions Live on BasicSwap DEXLitecoin\nMimbleWimble balances and balance conversions are now live on BasicSwap DEX, a\nfirst step towards full MWEB swaps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/litecoin-mweb-balances-and-conversions-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\nBasicSwap DEX is a decentralized exchange protocol and platform powered by\natomic swaps and SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a distributed data and\nmessaging protocol (often referred to as a “mixnet”). It offers a non-custodial\nand privacy-first trading experience, enabling trustless cross-chain swaps\nbetween different cryptocurrencies across various blockchains. And just like\nParticl Marketplace, it imposes no fees, restrictions, or data collection\npractices.\n\nAnd while it has always included Litecoin since its inception, it recently\nintegrated MWEB balances, paving the way for full MWEB swaps once Litecoin's\nupcoming core update — which will detect incoming Litecoin transactions using\nonly the viewkey without requiring the spendkey — goes live.\n\nTrade Litecoin on BasicSwap DEX (Litecoin DEX)By integrating BasicSwap into\nParticl Marketplace, alternative payment options are introduced at the time of\ncheckout, allowing users to seamlessly pay for items using their preferred\ncryptocurrency, a prime candidate of which being the fast and private Litecoin\nMWEB token.\n\nThis synergy aligns perfectly with Litecoin's vision of becoming a viable and\npractical form of digital cash, providing an additional real-world use case that\nfurther solidifies its position.\n\nBuilding Bridges Between Cryptocurrencies\nThe upcoming integration of BasicSwap and Litecoin MWEB on Particl Marketplace\nexemplifies BasicSwap's broader mission of forging bridges between diverse\ncryptocurrency communities and projects through its cross-chain functionality.\nThis synergy unites our efforts toward a shared vision of building a global\neconomy that prioritizes sovereignty and interoperability - the great promise of\ncrypto.\n\nBy enabling the use of Litecoin on Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap fosters a\nsymbiotic relationship that holds immense promise. Cultivating interoperability\nbetween the two ecosystems will accelerate the adoption of Litecoin as a\npractical, decentralized, and privacy-focused payment solution, while further\npositioning Particl as an enabler of financial activities beyond simple\npeer-to-peer transactions.\n\nIf you share this vision, we invite you to join the Particl and BasicSwap\ncommunity as we build towards a sovereign future and contribute to the mission,\nwhether through code or spreading awareness within the Litecoin community\nitself. As the economy is fundamentally a social phenomenon, every contribution,\nbig or small, propels us forward.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]Following last week's release\nof the MVP for multi-net capabilities using Simplex as the first alternative\nnetwork, we've identified several Simplex-specific issues that we're currently\nworking to resolve.\n\nDue to Simplex's complex and intricate network architecture, these issues are\nproving challenging to address, requiring additional development time.
