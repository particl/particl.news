It’s safe to say, this new revamped marketplace is bound to\nimpress more than a few heads. Not only will it look much better and be a lot\neasier to use, but it’s performance will also feel like day and night for anyone\nthat has used the marketplace before.\n\nHere is the latest development report from Development Manager Henk Swardt.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProgress Report\n * As most of you are already aware now, a new version of Particl Desktop\n   (2.3.3.) was released a short while ago. This introduced a slightly updated\n   marketplace codebase in order to address a bug experienced in the buyflow\n   when using Particl Core 0.19. While the update and change went well, some\n   problems were encountered during the signing and notarizing of the Mac\n   builds, which delayed the release a little. This, unfortunately, took some\n   time to fix and get working again, but eventually got sorted and we were able\n   to release the builds.\n * The basics of the re-implementation of the listing details view (effectively\n   the modal that is displayed when clicking on a listing) into Particl Desktop\n   has been completed. We’re now using this specific modal in more places now in\n   order to provide details on a particular listing or order wherever it may be\n   necessary to do so. For example, it is now displayed during the buyflow when\n   needing to look over the details of the item ordered without having to jump\n   off the page. This is a common behaviour for most online marketplaces and\n   will now be part of Particl as well.\n * After some discussions and testing around the creation and display of product\n   templates, as well as the publishing of them into marketplace listings, there\n   was a need to modify and re-work some aspects of the way this was being done\n   in the new ‘Sell’ section of the market module in the Particl Desktop. This\n   re-work is currently in progress.\n * A new “Inventory & Products” tab in the ‘Sell’ section has been added. This\n   will act as a central place for your products in stock (which effectively\n   means splitting the Sell > Listings tab into two separate ones).\n * Due to the integration of “infinite markets” and necessary for it, you can\n   now see which inventory items are published on which markets and storefronts.\n   This will also help with Quantity Management in the future, one of Particl’s\n   current roadmap items.\n * A new batch publish feature for pushing created/imported inventory items\n   (Products) on the marketplace is currently being worked on.\n * The “Import Listings” section of Particl Desktop has now become “Import\n   Products” and has been significantly redesigned to be easier to use.\n * The interface and usability of the escrow process and Market modals for\n   pushing Orders to next their next stages (ie. Accept bid, Mark as delivered,\n   etc.) has been redesigned.\n * The Market Overview page has been redesigned to work more as a guidepost or\n   dashboard for a quick overview of the latest activity that has happened since\n   the last visit — clicking on a card will take you directly to the relevant\n   place.\n * The Questions and Answers layout has been globally redesigned and reused at\n   multiple places for easier access (i.e. directly in a Listing’s details and\n   in a dedicated Sell/Buy > Questions & Answers tab).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSneak Peeks\nTo better illustrate some of the changes currently being worked on, here are\nsome live screenshots taken from the latest internal builds. Please keep in mind\neverything showed here is still a work in progress and subject to change before\nthe release.\n\nMarket’s Overview Page\nThe Market’s Overview page will now act as a guidepost or dashboard for getting\na quick but detailed overview of all actions requiring your attention.\n\nReworked Exchange Module\nParticl Desktop’s in-app swap section has been fully isolated from other modules\nand now acts as its own independent module. Coins and exchanges displayed in\nthis screenshot are not announcements of any sort but rather a good\ndemonstration of where this module is headed UI/UX-wise.\n\nQuestions and Answers\nAs mentioned in the Progress Report of this Development Update, the Q/A\nfunctionality has now been integrated into additional pages for easier access.\nUsers will now be notified whenever they receive a new question or answer to a\nlisting and will be able to navigate to it without much hassle.\n\nMarket Settings\nThe Market Settings page allows you to manage market-related settings. As more\nfeatures and functionalities get added to the marketplace moving forward, here\nis where you’ll be able to tweak their settings as well as your preferences.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Development-Update--05-06-2020-/1-DDaMGsjP5VvVlMaj3HTYQg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>For the past few weeks, the Particl developers have been making good progress in building and improving on the marketplace as well as adding a ton of functionalities.

Here are the latest progress\nupdates, as reported by Development Manager Henk Swardt.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCore\nOur beloved Tecnovert has been hard at work, Particl Core 0.19.1.1\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#01911] \nhas been released which includes some improvements required by the Ledger team.\n\ntecnovert/particl-core\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.1.1]\nRelease Notes:\nhttps://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#01911\nHashes…github.com\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.1.1]\n\n * Merged Bitcoin 0.19.1 backports.\n * Added generatemnemonic command to particl-wallet.\n * Qt receiving addresses table displays relative paths.\n * Qt receiving addresses page can verify an address on a hardware device.\n * Path of change address is sent to ledger hardware devices\n\nDesktop\nThe new Core version was successfully tested against Particl Desktop 2.3.x and\neverything is working correctly. Thus, Particl Core 0.19.1.1 has been pushed to\nall existing Particl Desktop 2.3.2 clients and to the current work-in-progress\n(the future 2.4.x release) builds as well.\n\nGood progress has also been made to the new Particl Desktop client. The bulk of\nthe rebuilding of the listing template creation functionality is now almost\ncomplete. These changes will still need to be re-visited and updated at a later\npoint to cater for the new changes being introduced in the market codebase, but\nthat should be a minor update and quick to do.\n\nMarket\nA large portion of the refactored market codebase is in the process of being\nmade available as part of the feature branch we use for GUI integration\ndevelopment.\n\nCopay\nAs for the Copay app, we are still looking into the issue that has been causing\nblank history views. We are required to make some API changes and these proved\nto be a bit more tricky than we hoped it would be. Please bear with us as we\nwork through this.\n\nSwap Engine\nWe have added and made ready a new exchange bot and have been adding and testing\nsome additional coins to the in-app swapg engine of Particl desktop. The tests\nhave been successful, keep an eye out for new coins to be available on Particl\nDesktop once the big Infinite Markets update comes out!\n\nThis should get some more people digging around Particl and using it with their\nfavorite cryptocurrency.\n\nHardware Wallet Playground\nAn easy to setup development and test environment for hardware wallets & their\nintegration with particl-core has been set up. The goal is to make an automated\ntest suite against emulated hardware wallets. It is very much under active\ndevelopment, but PRs are appreciated.\n\nparticl/hardware-wallet-playground\n[https://github.com/particl/hardware-wallet-playground]\nThe purpose of this repository is to provide an easy to setup development &\ntest\nenvironment for hardware wallets &…github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/hardware-wallet-playground]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Development-Update--08-05-2020-/1-DDaMGsjP5VvVlMaj3HTYQg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Like mentioned in the previous <a href=\"https://particl.news/project-update-22-04-2020-1a57c0e2b5c1\"><strong>Project Update</strong></a>, Particl is now going to be posting more regular development updates to keep you informed of the latest progress behind the scenes.</p><p>Today is the first such development update!

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News.
