The spectacular\nfailures of some centralized exchanges, like the Celsius debacle or last\nwinter’s implosion of the FTX exchange where billions of dollars of customer’s\nfunds were stolen obviously does nothing to help this climate.\n\nThere is, at the heart of the CEX vs DEX dynamic, a fundamental divide; while\nbig centralized entities suit traditional market logic, and can adapt these\nprinciples to fuel their own growth, they go against the fundamental principle\nof blockchain and cryptocurrency itself: private, peer-to-peer money.\n\nA Path Ahead\nIt could be argued that atomic swaps represent the most decentralized,\npotentially most private way to exchange cryptocurrencies. They are, of course,\nextremely resilient — as long as the blockchain accepts your transaction and you\nhave a reliable, hopefully private way to communicate with the other person, you\ncan swap. This, in effect, makes them exactly as decentralized as the\nblockchains involved. It also opens the door to entirely eliminating trust from\nthe process, unlike centralized models where you have to trust entities such as\nBinance, Celsius or FTX, and give them full control of your keys.\n\nIt was the Decred team who first made this technology a practical reality\n[https://github.com/decred/atomicswap], with their implementation of the first\nHTLC-based atomic swaps. At their core, HTLC swaps are easy to understand. They\ninvolve 'Hashed Timelock Contracts', which are types of smart contracts, on both\nthe buyer and seller sides. This means that both blockchains must have Timelock\nand Hashlock capabilities.\n\nBesides this limiting requirement, the HTLC swap also lacks privacy. While it\nallows for trustless, atomic swap exchanges to exist, it also creates a new\nproblem with it: when making a swap, a secret is created, hashed out, and\ninscribed, minutes apart, in the blockchains of both participating blockchains.\nThe problem here is that while this allows the protocol to verify the\ntransaction and move through the next steps of a swap, it also makes it trivial\nfor outside observers to infer the two participants of a swap, as well as what\namount of money is being exchanged. Here, an important privacy issue must be\naddressed.\n\nPoint Time Locked Contract Swaps and Adaptor Signatures\nAn important stepping stone to making atomic swaps the trustless, decentralized\nand hyper-private powerhouse that it can be lays in adaptor signatures.\n\nAs we explored in this piece [https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/],\nthe adaptor signature atomic swap scheme, otherwise referable to as \"Point Time\nLocked Contract (PTLC) swaps, begins with Andrew Poelstra’s work on scriptless\nscripts. Poelstra’s work was born out of necessity to interact with\nMimbleWimble, an extremely rigid blockchain protocol. These scriptless scripts\nexploit the linear nature of Schnorr signatures\n[https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/introduction-schnorr-signatures]: by\nusing Schnorr signatures in clever ways that are expanded further in this\narticle [https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/], or in greater\ntechnical detail here [https://hongchao.me/scriptless-script/].\n\nPoelstra’s work, in any case, makes it possible to replicate certain smart\ncontract capabilities without needing any of the actual smart contract language\na given coin may have. The adaptor signature swap, as such, is an example of a\nscriptless script.\n\nHowever, and this is important, Bitcoin and Monero do not use Schnorr signatures\nin its cryptographic signature algorithm — instead, they use a classic Elliptic\nCurve Digital Signature Algorithm, or ECDSA. There are a lot of differences\nbetween the two that we will not get into today, but suffice to say, adaptor\nsignature swaps on blockchain protocols using ECDSA curves, like Particl's PART,\nwould fall under the category of \"semi-scriptless protocols\n[https://medium.com/crypto-garage/adaptor-signature-on-ecdsa-cac148dfa3ad]\".\n\nThere is a huge benefit here compared to HTLC swaps, other than the fact that it\nenables PART's anon transaction type and other RingCT coins such as XMR to be\natomically swapped: they do not rely on identical hashes that need to be\ninscribed on the participating blockchains.\n\nOf course, in the case of RingCT based coins, that wouldn’t be much of a problem\neven if we were able to swap them using traditional HTLC swaps — which, again,\nis not possible on ECDSA schemes — because the hashes would be completely\nhidden.\n\nBut the beautiful thing here is that adaptor signature swaps can actually apply\nto a vast number of cryptocurrencies, and at the same time, make the swaps much,\nmuch more private.\n\nPre-Signed Transactions\nAn important aspect to the adaptor signature swap scheme is the use of\npre-signed refund transactions to solve the inherent problem of incomplete\nswaps, and achieve trustless, infallible atomic swaps while operating within the\nconfines of semi-scriptless protocols.\n\nPre-signing the refund transaction, addressing the XMR-BTC unhappy path problem.\nLet’s take a look at an atomic swap where Alice tries to swap 1 BTC with Bob for\n1 XMR. The first thing they do is pre-sign the refund transactions for Bitcoin.\nThis can be compared to signing the divorce papers before you get married. This\nallows them to split amicably even if one disappears and leaves the other\nstranded. Now at that very moment in time, the refund transaction is useless\nbecause they haven't deposited any money — much like you cannot file a divorce\nif you’ve never gotten married in the first place.\n\nThis is mandatory to making adaptor signature based swaps a functional reality\nin the real world, as any widespread implementations needs to account for\nincomplete swaps, interrupted flows, and other \"unhappy\" paths.\n\nAdditional Privacy and Scalability Improvements\nDuring the implementation of adaptor signature-based swaps into the BasicSwap\nDEX, we scrutinized the code to identify possible improvements that could be\nincorporated into the technology. The creation of this novel atomic swap type\nhas been a testament to open-source collaboration, and it's only fitting that we\ncontribute back to the community.\n\nAnd so, we ended up identifying a method to boost the privacy of PTLC swaps\nfurther and decrease the transaction size by adjusting a specific code segment.\n\nOriginal logic:\n\nOP_IF\n\tOP_SHA256 <hs> OP_EQUALVERIFY\n\t2 <Ba> <Bb> 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG\nOP_ELSE\n\t<t0> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP\n\t2 <Bra> <Brb> 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG\nOP_ENDIF\n\nSource:\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap/master/whitepaper/xmr-btc.pdf\nSimplified logic:\n\n2 <Ba> <Bb> 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG\n\nWith this change, adaptor signature-based swaps now look like any other 2-of-2\nmulti-signature transaction on the blockchain.

You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\n> Note: This week has seens some particularly time-consuming upstream merges,\nnotably pertaining to modifications made to the libsecp256k1 library and the\nwallet db code. This, unfortunately, diverted time from other crucial tasks, but\nwe've successfully implemented these merges into Particl Core.\nBasicSwap ?\nUser Interface ?\nBasicSwap’s GUI 2.0.2 Now AvailableBasicSwap’s new 2.0.2 user interface is now\navailable, featuring a wide range of improvements to the user experience and UI\ncodebase.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswaps-gui-2-0-2-now-available/]Earlier this week, we\nrolled out version 2.0.2 of BasicSwap's user interface. This release contains a\nmultitude of enhancements, additions, and fixes, a significant portion of which\ncame directly from community feedback. \n\nHere is a comprehensive breakdown of the modifications introduced by this\nupdate.\n\n * Extensive enhancements to the Wallets page including an alternate display of\n   asset values in USD and BTC, improved visualization of pending balances, and\n   more accurate button labeling.\n * The order book now offers a display of rates and amounts in USD for a more\n   intuitive user experience, and also remembers your most recent filter\n   history.\n * Tooltips have been added across various locations to better explain certain\n   features.\n * New \"Accept\" button in the \"Available Bids\" section and a \"Details\" button in\n   \"Bids Received\"/\"Bids Sent\" sections for improved navigation.\n * Users now have the ability to prune offer, bid, and swap history from the\n   user interface, enabling a cleaner workspace.\n * The management of SMSG addresses has been significantly improved for better\n   user control.\n * A range of back-end improvements have been made, including code clean-ups,\n   upgraded icons, and overall GUI enhancements for a smoother user experience.\n\nNow that this update is live, our next objective, on the desktop UI front, is to\noverhaul the DEX's 'New Offer' page. This revamp will be included in our\nforthcoming GUI update, specifically version 2.0.3.\n\nBi-directional Monero Swaps ?\nWe've once again made substantial strides towards the integration of\nbi-directional Monero atomic swaps into the BasicSwap DEX, although there is\nstill no code officially merged on Github yet.\n\nWhile progress towards completion of this important feature is satisfying,\nadditional work and thorough testing are still needed before it is fully ready\nfor deployment. But since this is Particl developer Tecnovert's current main\nfocus, we expect this improved and key functionality to be ready relatively\nshortly.\n\nNew Particl Website Re-prioritized ✅\nWith version 2.0.2 of BasicSwap's user interface live, we can now divert more\nresources towards the design of the new Particl website. Consequently, this\nshould considerably speed up the completion process of this task, which has been\nin progress for some time.\n\nNew Blog Series on DEXs and Atomic Swaps ?\nThe DEX Revolution — The Evolution of Atomic SwapsMaking atomic swaps more\naccessible and private than ever before.Particl NewsCangrejo\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\nAs we progress through the open beta of the BasicSwap DEX, we've inaugurated,\nthis week, a new series focused on decentralized trading exchanges and atomic\nswaps. \n\nThis multipart series delve into the complex mechanics and intricacies of\nbuilding a privacy-first DEX, and elucidate why such platforms are increasingly\nessential today and for the foreseeable future.\n\nTo read the first installment of this new series, follow this link\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

Due to changes in the data structure of\nBasicSwap-related SMSG messages, previous instances of the DEX are not\nforward-compatible with this new version. This means that offers posted from\nupdated instances will not appear on older instances. All users must update to\nmaintain full network connectivity.\nAfter 171 commits over 164 files changed coming from 6 different contributors\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/compare/v0.14.3...v0.14.4], we are\nexcited to announce the release of a significant BasicSwap update (v0.14.4)\nalong with an update to its user interface, now at version 3.2.1.\n\nThis substantial update represents weeks of dedicated effort, incorporating\nnumerous improvements, bug fixes, new features, and significant refactors of\ndifferent core components of the system. The changes stem from extensive testing\nby both contributors and community members, resulting in a significant step\nforward for user experience and platform stability.\n\nNoteworthy Updates ?\nWhile this update is massive in scope, many changes are backend changes to\nimprove efficiency, stability, and cross-compatibility. However, several\nsignificant user experience enhancements are worth highlighting.\n\nVarious Coin Core Updates ✅\nWe've made several updates to the various coins available on BasicSwap DEX.\nWhether these updates involve new core versions or integration improvements, we\nhighly recommend updating your node versions as soon as possible.\n\nSignificant UI Refactor ?️\nA major refactoring of the user interface code has occurred over the last couple\nof weeks. While these changes primarily involve code organization and better\npractices that aren't immediately apparent to end users, we've also implemented\nnumerous UI upgrades, including:\n\n * Local reputation tracking\n * Enhanced order book formatting with additional information\n * New Bids page\n * Improved Swaps in Progress page\n * Better Offer pages\n * More responsive and dynamic page behavior\n * Better rate fetching\n * Much more...\n\nThe interface changes since our last version (v0.14.4) are substantial, and\nyou'll miss out on many new features and improvements if you don't update.\n\nClient Authentication ?\nWe've added the ability to configure your BasicSwap instance with client\nauthentication. This feature protects both the webUI and API port access with a\npassword of your choosing. \n\nThis is vital if you're running BasicSwap on a cloud server or using the\nmarket-making companion script in a network environment you don't completely\ntrust. To set up client authentication, please refer to the installation\ndocumentation.\n\nMulti-Net Support ?\nWe've pushed to master the preliminary code for upcoming multi network support\nfor BasicSwap. We've deployed the first phase of a significant infrastructure\nupdate to our networking architecture. This new feature, currently called\n\"multi-net,\" enables BasicSwap to distribute swap, offer, and bid messages\nacross multiple messaging networks beyond SMSG when the primary network\nexperiences high load.\n\nSince all messages adhere to a unified encryption and formatting standard, even\nnon-decentralized networks (such as Telegram or email) could be utilized without\ncompromising user privacy or security.\n\nThis new functionality delivers several key benefits:\n\n 1. Improved platform scalability and resilience\n 2. Greater flexibility for third-party integrations, allowing partners to use\n    their preferred compatible networks for message relay\n 3. Cross-network message compatibility, eliminating the need for users to\n    operate on the same network during swaps\n\nWhile the foundation is now in place, further development is still needed before\nthe implementation becomes fully usable. The current proof of concept using\nSimplex broadcasts messages to the entire group rather than targeting specific\nrecipients — an inefficiency we're addressing given Simplex's limitations.\n\nThe core architecture is designed to extend SMSG functionality across various\nnetworks. All messages maintain SMSG encryption and message IDs for consistency,\nalthough additional work is required to ensure full compatibility of Python SMSG\nmessages across all networks and to add convenience functions for submitting\npre-formed SMSG messages. Currently, this new system pushes to the core through\nP2P connections (for SMSG testing) but doesn't yet join the SMSG and Simplex\nnetworks.\n\nNot to be overlooked is the important advantage of this approach in its\nflexibility regarding network requirements. Since messages are (or will be)\nfully valid SMSG entities, they can be transmitted over plaintext networks like\nTelegram, Delta, or even Pastebin. Email systems supporting POP3/IMAP protocols\nare particularly well-suited for more decentralization-focused users. It's worth\nnoting that centralized options, including Simplex, may still expose some\ninformation pseudonymously about which accounts are communicating with each\nother.\n\nAcceptance Strategy Knowledge ?\nWhen publishing a new offer, the SMSG messages relaying its details to the rest\nof the network now carry information about whether the offer is set to\nautomatically accept bids. This information is also displayed on an offer's page\nbefore submitting a bid, helping you make better-informed decisions about which\noffers to bid on.\n\nPlease note that this change means previous instances of BasicSwap will not be\nable to properly resolve offer messages from up-to-date instances. Updating your\nBasicSwap instance is mandatory to receive all offers from the network. However,\noffer messages from older instances remain compatible with the new version, so\nupgrading now carries no downside.\n\nDocs ?️\nWe've migrated BasicSwap's documentation from the Particl Academy (which uses\nReadTheDocs) to a more maintainable and flexible platform (Docusaurus) at \ndocs.basicswapdex.com [https://docs.basicswapdex.com/docs/intro/]. While we'll\nmaintain the BasicSwap documentation on the Particl Academy, all new updates\nwill be provided at the new location.\n\nInstall the Latest BasicSwap Update ?️\nDue to a significant change in what data is carried in BasicSwap-related\nmessages, it is mandatory to update the DEX.

The changes stem from extensive testing by both contributors and community members, resulting in a significant step forward for user experience and platform stability.</p><h2 id=\"noteworthy-updates-\">Noteworthy Updates ?</h2><p>While this update is massive in scope, many changes are backend changes to improve efficiency, stability, and cross-compatibility. However, several significant user experience enhancements are worth highlighting.</p><h3 id=\"various-coin-core-updates-\">Various Coin Core Updates ✅</h3><p>We've made several updates to the various coins available on BasicSwap DEX. Whether these updates involve new core versions or integration improvements, we highly recommend updating your node versions as soon as possible.</p><h3 id=\"significant-ui-refactor-\">Significant UI Refactor ?️</h3><p>A major refactoring of the user interface code has occurred over the last couple of weeks. While these changes primarily involve code organization and better practices that aren't immediately apparent to end users, we've also implemented numerous UI upgrades, including:</p><ul><li>Local reputation tracking</li><li>Enhanced order book formatting with additional information</li><li>New Bids page</li><li>Improved Swaps in Progress page</li><li>Better Offer pages</li><li>More responsive and dynamic page behavior</li><li>Better rate fetching</li><li>Much more...</li></ul><p>The interface changes since our last version (v0.14.4) are substantial, and you'll miss out on many new features and improvements if you don't update.</p><h3 id=\"client-authentication-\">Client Authentication ?</h3><p>We've added the ability to configure your BasicSwap instance with client authentication. This feature protects both the webUI and API port access with a password of your choosing. </p><p>This is vital if you're running BasicSwap on a cloud server or using the market-making companion script in a network environment you don't completely trust. To set up client authentication, please refer to the installation documentation.</p><h3 id=\"multi-net-support-\">Multi-Net Support ?</h3><p>We've pushed to <code class=\"language-text\">master</code> the preliminary code for upcoming multi network support for BasicSwap. We've deployed the first phase of a significant infrastructure update to our networking architecture. This new feature, currently called \"multi-net,\" enables BasicSwap to distribute swap, offer, and bid messages across multiple messaging networks beyond SMSG when the primary network experiences high load.</p><p>Since all messages adhere to a unified encryption and formatting standard, even non-decentralized networks (such as Telegram or email) could be utilized without compromising user privacy or security.</p><p>This new functionality delivers several key benefits:</p><ol><li>Improved platform scalability and resilience</li><li>Greater flexibility for third-party integrations, allowing partners to use their preferred compatible networks for message relay</li><li>Cross-network message compatibility, eliminating the need for users to operate on the same network during swaps</li></ol><p>While the foundation is now in place, further development is still needed before the implementation becomes fully usable. The current proof of concept using Simplex broadcasts messages to the entire group rather than targeting specific recipients — an inefficiency we're addressing given Simplex's limitations.</p><p>The core architecture is designed to extend SMSG functionality across various networks. All messages maintain SMSG encryption and message IDs for consistency, although additional work is required to ensure full compatibility of Python SMSG messages across all networks and to add convenience functions for submitting pre-formed SMSG messages. Currently, this new system pushes to the core through P2P connections (for SMSG testing) but doesn't yet join the SMSG and Simplex networks.</p><p>Not to be overlooked is the important advantage of this approach in its flexibility regarding network requirements. Since messages are (or will be) fully valid SMSG entities, they can be transmitted over plaintext networks like Telegram, Delta, or even Pastebin. Email systems supporting POP3/IMAP protocols are particularly well-suited for more decentralization-focused users. It's worth noting that centralized options, including Simplex, may still expose some information pseudonymously about which accounts are communicating with each other.</p><h3 id=\"acceptance-strategy-knowledge-\">Acceptance Strategy Knowledge ?</h3><p>When publishing a new offer, the SMSG messages relaying its details to the rest of the network now carry information about whether the offer is set to automatically accept bids. This information is also displayed on an offer's page before submitting a bid, helping you make better-informed decisions about which offers to bid on.</p><p>Please note that this change means previous instances of BasicSwap will not be able to properly resolve offer messages from up-to-date instances. Updating your BasicSwap instance is mandatory to receive all offers from the network. However, offer messages from older instances remain compatible with the new version, so upgrading now carries no downside.</p><h3 id=\"docs-\">Docs ?️</h3><p>We've migrated BasicSwap's documentation from the Particl Academy (which uses ReadTheDocs) to a more maintainable and flexible platform (Docusaurus) at <a href=\"https://docs.basicswapdex.com/docs/intro/\">docs.basicswapdex.com</a>. While we'll maintain the BasicSwap documentation on the Particl Academy, all new updates will be provided at the new location.</p><h2 id=\"install-the-latest-basicswap-update-\">Install the Latest BasicSwap Update ?️</h2><p>Due to a significant change in what data is carried in BasicSwap-related messages, it is mandatory to update the DEX. Failure to do so will result in your instance not picking up messages from up-to-date instances.</p><p>To install the new update, which includes both the codebase and user interface updates, simply <a
