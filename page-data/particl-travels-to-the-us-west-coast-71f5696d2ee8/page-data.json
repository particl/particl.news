As you probably already know, the team initiated its \nParticl World Tour [https://particl.news/particl-world-tour-2019-f6e3d3c7e09c] \nby first going to the United States and attend 3 different conferences —\nMoney2020 [https://us.money2020.com/], WCC [https://worldcryptocon.com/], and \nSFBW’s Epicenter [https://sfblockchainweek.io/].\n\nIt’s safe to say that, throughout this first part of the Particl World Tour, the\nteam has made tremendous progress on all fronts and has been able to collect a\nsignificant amount of feedback, advice, contacts, and most importantly, new\nfriends taking part, just like the team, in this ambitious blockchain journey!\nAlong the way, Particl met with tech evangelists, developers, capital funds,\nbusiness owners, market makers, innovators, and was even able to scoop a new\nadvisor [https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190348538498019329], Bryan\nWoods [https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-woods-3243a1167] (Spend.com\n[https://spend.com]’s President) to assist and support the project in making the\nbest out of the many opportunities currently opening up within the payment and\neCommerce industries. The team had the blessing of being accompanied, for most\nof the trip, by Crypto PR Lab, a San Francisco-based PR firm that has grown\ncloser to the team ever since meeting for the first time at Consensus 2019.\nTheir insight, reach, and contacts within the local SF blockchain community have\nproven to be an invaluable asset for the entire duration of the trip.\n\nFor this first part of the Particl World Tour, the team split into different\ngroups and spread out on the US West Coast (San Francisco & Las Vegas) to cover\nmultiple events and maximize results. This strategy allowed to cover a lot of\nground at once and has brought very valuable connections that could then be best\nleveraged by the fact that the whole team ended up meeting as one for SFBW’s\nEpicenter. It doesn’t happen all the time that so many team members get to meet,\nin-person, and so the strategy was to optimize this precious opportunity and get\nthe most done out of it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSan Francisco\nWhile a portion of the team was in Vegas for Money2020 and WCC, another portion\nwas already in San Francisco for the start of the San Francisco Blockchain Week.\nEpicenter, the week’s main and last event, is where Particl held a booth for two\ndays as well as a 30-minute talk. But in no way was it the only event of\ninterest!\n\nThe city was literally buzzing about blockchain and the many events attracted\nthe entirety of the local, but very front running, San Francisco-based\ncryptocurrency community. It really felt home! Let’s not forget San Francisco\nand the Bay Area, in general, is the homeland of startups and the heart of the\ntech industry. People from all around the world join together with the hopes of\ncreating the next new groundbreaking technology or project. Particl fits very\nmuch within that innovation-focused and very forward-thinking mindset.\n\nSFBW’s particular type of schedule (having the main event at the very end of the\nweek) proved to be an excellent opportunity for the team to initiate the first\npoints of contact with multiple key people by attending many of the side-events\nand evening receptions organized all throughout the week. Then, during the two\ndays of Epicenter, came the opportunities to capitalize on these contacts made\nduring the week by demonstrating the marketplace and have more quality time with\nthese people.\n\nBefore Epicenter, the Particl team attended CESC, the San Francisco Blockchain\nWeek’s kickoff event where it set up a table at the location to improvise a\nquick Particl booth with a couple of computers running the Open Marketplace. As\nis now usual, the marketplace really impressed and gained great reactions and\ninterest which brought new pairs of eyes on Particl and made new friends around,\nlike the stand-up guys over at Cracking Crypto\n[https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto],\n[https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto] for example.\n\nDr. Kap Giving an Interview to the Cracking Crypto ShowThe team also attended\nmore than a dozen side-events (most of the time, many a night…who needs sleep?)\nall throughout the week such as receptions organized by Polychain Capital,\nPantera Capital, Outliers Ventures, Starfish Network, eToro, Huobi, OceanEx, and\nmore. The connections established at all these events really did set the state\nfor when everybody would be crossing paths again later at Epicenter.\n\nLas Vegas\nAnd so while a portion of the team was in San Francisco for the start of SFBW,\nJoe Fisher and Cryptoguard were in Las Vegas, to attend Money2020\n[https://us.money2020.com/] and the World Crypto Conference (WCC)\n[https://worldcryptocon.com/].\n\nParticl Welcomes Bryan Woods, Spend.com’s President, as New AdvisorAt Money2020 [https://us.money2020.com/], a Fintech conference focused on\ninnovations within the payment industry, the focus was entirely on sealing the\ndeal with a new advisor, Bryan Woods, President at Spend.com. Spend.com is a\nteam that has been growing closer to the Particl team ever since meeting at the\nConsensus 2019 booth in New York City.\n\nThe Particl team spent 2 full days working at Spend.com’s booth (one of the big\nsponsors of Money2020) to discuss and work on various strategies moving into\n2020. This is a direct follow-up to another in-person trip the team made earlier\nin October 2019 to meet up with Spend.com. Meeting once again, at Money2020,\nallowed both teams to initiate and walk the first steps of a long-term\nrelationship together. More details will follow this coming Thursday in a blog\npost published on Particl.news. Definitely stay tuned!\n\nSpecial shoutout to Nicholas Merten [https://twitter.com/Nicholas_Merten], aka \nDataDash [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCatR7nWbYrkVXdxXb4cGXw], which the\nteam had the pleasure to cross paths with at Money2020. His focus, dedication,\nand projects to help cryptocurrencies move further along the path to mainstream\nadoption really impressed!\n\nNicholas Merten, aka Datadash, hanging out with ParticlThen, after Money2020,\nCryptoguard flew to join the rest of the team in San Francisco while Joe Fisher\nstayed an additional day in Vegas to take part in the WCC conference\n[https://worldcryptocon.com/].\n\nWCC was the perfect occasion to meet with some of the people the team had been\nlooking forward to meetup with again and yet another quality event to make the\nfirst points of contact with various people. Indeed, just like SFBW, WCC\nattracted a quality crowd as well as many leaders within the blockchain\nindustry, some of which couldn’t make it to SFBW. In that scenario, splitting\nthe team into two different cities really reaped a lot of benefits for Particl.\n\nJoe Fisher and Masha Prusakova at WCC 2019Epicenter — SFBW’s Main Event\nAnd then came Epicenter [https://sfblockchainweek.io/], the main event of the\nSan Francisco Blockchain Week. The Particl team all met as one the day before\nand came to the conference as a gold sponsor, had a booth right next to the main\nentrance, and gave a 30-minute talk on the Industry Stage.\n\nParticl Team Showing Off the Open Marketplace at SFBW’s EpicenterJust like\nthroughout the first part of the week, the reactions at the booth were\noverwhelmingly good and, maybe strangely enough, people still looked surprised\nthat a fully decentralized and no compromise blockchain project is already live\nand looking so good, even to this day. This is the typical feedback Particl has\nbeen receiving ever since it started going to more events this year.\n\nEpicenter’s crowd was definitely smaller than Consensus, but it was much more\nfocused and in “business mode”. The reason for this is actually important to\nunderstand. The people who still remain in blockchain after a more than\ntwo-year-long bear market and keep attending these kinds of events are the true\npioneers that will propel the next blockchain wave. They are the people fighting\nin the trenches, against all odds, to make sure the blockchain revolution will\none day catch up on the mainstream level.\n\nAnd in San Francisco, of all places, a place renowned for how many tech\ninnovations it generates every year. The people attending these conferences\ndon’t look at the industry with a narrow-minded view. No, they instead know the\nlong-term potential of these groundbreaking technologies and are the ones that\nare making it happen.\n\nThis is actually the main reason Particl wanted to attend SFBW. The team knew\nthe potential of this local blockchain community, thanks in part to attending\nthe SF-based Bitcoin2019\n[https://particl.news/particl-in-san-francisco-bitcoin2019-571fe31fe396] \nconference earlier in the year, and knew it would be a perfectly receptive and\nexcited crowd.\n\n, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman at Blockchain Research InstituteAnd the team\nwas right! Particl had the opportunity to spend some high-quality time with\nthought leaders and experts from many different industries and received many\nadvice and resources. For example, the Particl team had the chance to meet with \nDon Tapscott, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman at Blockchain Research Institute\n[https://www.blockchainresearchinstitute.org/], and earn 30 minutes of his time\njust before flying out to Europe.\n\nIndeed, just like with Don Tapscott, many similar breakout meetings, sit-downs,\nand evening-long discussions happened with several key people working on pushing\nblockchain forward. The team met with media, capital firms, lawyers, developers,\nbusiness developers, the inventor of eGift cards, and even a guy that can solve\na Rubics cube blindfolded, but more importantly, made many new friends on the\nway that are as passionate and dedicated to see cryptocurrencies succeed.\n\nThe team also had a 30-minute speaking slot on the Industry Stage and sent Dr.\nKap on stage. Some of the people the team has met throughout the week attended\nthe talk which further helped them understand the project’s vision and\nintentions. The official presentation video will be published within a few days\nby the SFBW organizers. In the meantime, you can check out Dr. Kap’s\npresentation on Particl’s Youtube channel.\n\n> The upload originally is a Periscope\n[https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB] \n[https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB]video\n[https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB] taken by Particl’s Community\nManager, Guillaume Benayoun. You can check out more video of the team in San\nFrancisco by browsing Ben’s Periscope uploads here: \nhttps://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1jMJgwZoNjWJL?t=1s\nThe team used the exposure and momentum provided by a full week of intensive\nnetworking to announce to major pieces of news that will help propel the project\nforward —an in-wallet integration of a Bitcoin exchange module\n[https://particl.news/particl-announces-bitcoin-exchange-integration-into-particl-desktop-e7c0940c0b4d] \nand the official beginning of an intimate and long-term relationship with\nSpend.com [https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190348538498019329]. Bryan\nWoods, Spend.com’s President, was announced at the same time as a new advisor to\nthe project.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTakeaways\nThink of this whole US West Coast trip as a giant, never-ending brainstorming\nsession with not only team members, but advisors, leaders, and experts from many\ndifferent industries hungry to see any solid blockchain tech succeed.\n\nThe Particl Team Debriefing Post-SFBWThe people the team met get it. They get\nthe potential of blockchain and Particl both. They want to see the industry\nsucceed and the products powered by blockchain land in the hands of everyday\npeople.\n\nWhile the team already knew about the quality of the Particl platform, it is now\ncrystal clear from all the feedback received that the Particl ecosystem and its\nOpen Marketplace is very advanced in terms of tech compared to almost any other\nend-user-focused blockchain product. The vision, mission, and disruptive\npotential of such a platform is also a shared feeling within all of the people\nmet during this trip.\n\nBut getting this product into people’s hands is equally important, if not more. \nThe best product in the world serves no purpose if it is not being used by\nanyone. This trip provided the team with a lot of resources, connections, and\noffers that will help Particl jump in with two feet into this new\nadoption-focused phase the project is headed to.\n\nThe team has been able to discuss, in detail and with valuable outside\nperspectives, the next steps moving into 2020. What’s coming next in 2020 will\nbe very methodical and carefully planned, and it’s all about getting that\nadoption going. Thanks to this US West Coast trip, the team is now equipped with\nthe best resources it could have hoped for at the best time imaginable. Let’s do\nthis! ?\n\nWhat’s Next?\nThe development team has been focused on the next few items, as identified a\nwhile ago\n[https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b]\n, required before aggressive adoption strategies can start getting a worthy\nconversion rate. Indeed, the Open Marketplace and Particl Desktop still lack a\nfew features the team would like to have before actively trying to drive users\nto the marketplace.\n\nIn the meantime, the communications and strategy team is now embarking in a new\nphase to start the onboarding of users as soon as the platform is ready for\nadoption. The team will be taking part in various internal workshops in Berlin\nin the coming weeks along with key connections and advisors made throughout the\npast two weeks. That’s to craft strategies related to the user adoption of the\nOpen Marketplace and the Particl network in general and help the project pivot\ntowards a a more “business” focused phase in the most efficient manner possible.\n\nIt is very clear, the team is coming back from this US West Coast trip extremely\nmotivated and hungry for success. A lot of doors are opening up, on all fronts,\ndirectly to Particl and also to the blockchain industry itself. The world is\nreceptive to the idea of blockchain technology but cautious due to this\nnow-very-long bear market. It is why the next steps of the way need to be very\nmethodological to seize the most of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\n\nParticl Team After Epicenter’s ClosureAs you might start to understand simply by\nreading this post, this trip marks the beginning of brand new objectives,\nchallenges, and goals for the project. Think of it as the “war room phase”, the\nmoment where strategies are made and carefully, methodically set in motion.\n\nNext Locations of the Particl World Tour\nWith that in mind, the team is going to be attending, in a smaller capacity, two\nadditional events and then conclude it’s already very worthy Particl World Tour.\n\nIndeed, you’ll be able to find Particl at Blockshow Asia\n[https://blockshow.com/], in Singapore, and Slush Helsinki\n[https://www.slush.org/events/helsinki/], in Finland.\n\nAt Blockshow Asia, the same boots-on-the-grounds approach as used during SFBW’s\nside-events and WCC will be applied. It will be all about establishing the first\npoints of contact and reconvening with key people within the Asian market to get\nas much insight as possible. Don’t forget, as mentioned in a previous blog post\n[https://particl.news/particl-in-singapore-consensus-asia-a3be041d315e] on\nParticl.news, Singapore is a place of interest for Particl because of new tax\nregulations being proposed which would make any sale paid for with\ncryptocurrencies a tax-free event. It is a direct use-case for buying and\nselling using cryptocurrencies and a great opportunity for Particl to shine\nbrightly. This is, quite simply, crypto having a clear shot at going mainstream\nin Singapore…\n\nAt Slush Helsinki, a tech startup/founder focused conference, the team will be\noperating a booth and meeting up with various advisors and mentors specifically\ngoing to the event to help out motivated, young entrepreneurs. The team will\nconsist of Juha Kovanen (Marketplace Lead Developer), Gerlof van Ek (Lead\nDesigner, Developer), Dr. Kapil Amarasinghe (UK Particl Ambassador), and Gloria\n(Particl’s Communications & Strategy Team).\n\nBoth these events will allow Particl to receive even more feedback, advice, and\nresources as it jumps right into its next phase. The timing of it all couldn’t\nbe better!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou, Too, Can Be a Part of it!\nThe best connections happen face-to-face, this is simply how things happen in\nthe space. The people you meet, in-person, by going to conferences and their\nrelated side-events are not the same crypto people you meet online. These are\nthe active and focused people working day and night on the blockchain\nrevolution. They are the ones that make it all happen!\n\nFor this reason, the Particl team very strongly encourages you to go out there\nand attend your local blockchain events. Crypto is not dead, it’s alive and\nkicking in a way that might surprise you! The bear market is making innovators\nmore motivated and hungry for success, a feeling that is not always shared by\nthe “online crypto community”. Go out there, meet people face-to-face, and be\nright in the middle of the biggest revolution of our times (with no hyperbole\nadded here ?).\n\nAfter all, meeting other crypto fans and innovators to change the world is just\none part of why you should attend these events. The other part is…well, it is so\nmuch FUN! Dare try it just once and you’ll be hooked!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStay tuned for more news about Spend.com’s relationship with Particl this coming\nThursday, the 14th of November. Then, on the 21st of November, Particl will be\nhaving another surprise announcement!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-fg-rxBVAgcC3I7WZpZR3dA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"recap-dr-kap-s-own-video-recap-of-the-events-\">Recap + Dr. Kap’s Own Video Recap of the Events ?</h3><p>The Particl team is finally back home from its US West Coast trip and hot damn was it an eventful week!

The team met with media, capital firms, lawyers, developers, business developers, the inventor of eGift cards, and even a guy that can solve a Rubics cube blindfolded, but more importantly, made many new friends on the way that are as passionate and dedicated to see cryptocurrencies succeed.</p><p>The team also had a 30-minute speaking slot on the Industry Stage and sent Dr. Kap on stage.

This trip provided the team with a lot of resources, connections, and offers that will help Particl jump in with two feet into this new adoption-focused phase the project is headed to.</p><p>The team has been able to discuss, in detail and with valuable outside perspectives, the next steps moving into 2020. What’s coming next in 2020 will be very methodical and carefully planned, and it’s all about getting that adoption going. Thanks to this US West Coast trip, the team is now equipped with the best resources it could have hoped for at the best time imaginable. Let’s do this! ?</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s Next?</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-SB2ytltBLugFKL1rJVhF_Q.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>The development team has been focused on the next few items, <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b\">as identified a while ago</a>, required before aggressive adoption strategies can start getting a worthy conversion rate. Indeed, the Open Marketplace and Particl Desktop still lack a few features the team would like to have before actively trying to drive users to the marketplace.</p><p>In the meantime, <strong>the communications and strategy team is now embarking in a new phase</strong> to start the onboarding of users as soon as the platform is ready for adoption. The team will be taking part in various internal workshops in Berlin in the coming weeks along with key connections and advisors made throughout the past two weeks. That’s to craft strategies related to the user adoption of the Open Marketplace and the Particl network in general and help the project pivot towards a a more “business” focused phase in the most efficient manner possible.</p><p>It is very clear, <strong>the team is coming back from this US West Coast trip extremely motivated and hungry for success</strong>. A lot of doors are opening up, on all fronts, directly to Particl and also to the blockchain industry itself. The world is receptive to the idea of blockchain technology but cautious due to this now-very-long bear market. It is why the next steps of the way need to be very methodological to seize the most of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-Gbg9aHfYJ9bhiThjAvvKwQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl Team After Epicenter’s Closure</figcaption></figure><p>As you might start to understand simply by reading this post, <strong>this trip marks the beginning of brand new objectives, challenges, and goals for the project.</strong> Think of it as the “war room phase”, the moment where strategies are made and carefully, methodically set in motion.</p><h3 id=\"next-locations-of-the-particl-world-tour\">Next Locations of the Particl World Tour</h3><p>With that in mind, the team is going to be attending, in a smaller capacity, two additional events and then conclude it’s already very worthy Particl World Tour.</p><p>Indeed, you’ll be able to find Particl at <a href=\"https://blockshow.com/\"><strong>Blockshow Asia</strong></a>, in Singapore, and <a href=\"https://www.slush.org/events/helsinki/\"><strong>Slush Helsinki</strong></a>, in Finland.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-cWDe1_sIGidEmR1cFeidDw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>At Blockshow Asia, the same boots-on-the-grounds approach as used during SFBW’s side-events and WCC will be applied. It will be all about establishing the first points of contact and reconvening with key people within the Asian market to get as much insight as possible. Don’t forget, as mentioned in a <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-in-singapore-consensus-asia-a3be041d315e\"><strong>previous blog post</strong></a> on Particl.news, <strong>Singapore is a place of interest for Particl because of new tax regulations being proposed which would make any sale paid for with cryptocurrencies a tax-free event.</strong> It is a direct use-case for buying and selling using cryptocurrencies and a great opportunity for Particl to shine brightly. This is, quite simply, crypto having a clear shot at going mainstream in Singapore…</p><p>At Slush Helsinki, a tech startup/founder focused conference, the team will be operating a booth and meeting up with various advisors and mentors specifically going to the event to help out motivated, young entrepreneurs. The team will consist of Juha Kovanen (Marketplace Lead Developer), Gerlof van Ek (Lead Designer, Developer), Dr. Kapil Amarasinghe (UK Particl Ambassador), and Gloria (Particl’s Communications &amp; Strategy Team).</p><p>Both these events will allow Particl to receive even more feedback, advice, and resources as it jumps right into its next phase. The timing of it all couldn’t be better!</p><hr><h2 id=\"you-too-can-be-a-part-of-it-\">You, Too, Can Be a Part of it!</h2><p>The best connections happen face-to-face, this is simply how things happen in the space. The people you meet, in-person, by going to conferences and their related side-events are not the same crypto people you meet online. These are the active and focused people working day and night on the blockchain revolution. They are the ones that make it all happen!</p><p><strong>For this reason, the Particl team very strongly encourages you to go out there and attend your local blockchain events.</strong> Crypto is not dead, it’s alive and kicking in a way that might surprise you! The bear market is making innovators more motivated and hungry for success, a feeling that is not always shared by the “online crypto community”. Go out there, meet people face-to-face, and be right in the middle of the biggest revolution of our times (with no hyperbole added here ?).</p><p>After all, meeting other crypto fans and innovators to change the world is just one part of why you should attend these events. The other part is…well, it is so much FUN! Dare try it just once and you’ll be hooked!</p><hr><p>Stay tuned for <strong>more news about Spend.com’s relationship with Particl this coming Thursday, the 14th of November</strong>.

As you probably already know, the team initiated its <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-world-tour-2019-f6e3d3c7e09c\"><strong>Particl World Tour</strong></a> by first going to the United States and attend 3 different conferences —<a href=\"https://us.money2020.com/\"><strong> Money2020</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://worldcryptocon.com/\"><strong>WCC</strong></a>, and<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://sfblockchainweek.io/\"><strong>SFBW’s Epicenter</strong></a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fB1yf5CaXHI\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>It’s safe to say that, throughout this first part of the Particl World Tour, the team has made tremendous progress on all fronts and has been able to collect a significant amount of feedback, advice, contacts, and most importantly, new friends taking part, just like the team, in this ambitious blockchain journey! Along the way, Particl met with tech evangelists, developers, capital funds, business owners, market makers, innovators, and was even able to scoop a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190348538498019329\"><strong>new advisor</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-woods-3243a1167\"><strong>Bryan Woods</strong></a> (<a href=\"https://spend.com\"><strong>Spend.com</strong></a>’s President) to assist and support the project in making the best out of the many opportunities currently opening up within the payment and eCommerce industries. <strong>The team had the blessing of being accompanied, for most of the trip, by Crypto PR Lab, a San Francisco-based PR firm</strong> that has grown closer to the team ever since meeting for the first time at Consensus 2019. Their insight, reach, and contacts within the local SF blockchain community have proven to be an invaluable asset for the entire duration of the trip.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JXnJg_HTXI8?feature=oembed\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>For this first part of the Particl World Tour, <strong>the team split into different groups and spread out on the US West Coast</strong> (San Francisco &#x26; Las Vegas) to cover multiple events and maximize results. This strategy allowed to cover a lot of ground at once and has brought very valuable connections that could then be best leveraged by the fact that the whole team ended up meeting as one for SFBW’s Epicenter. It doesn’t happen all the time that so many team members get to meet, in-person, and so the strategy was to optimize this precious opportunity and get the most done out of it.</p><hr><h2 id=\"san-francisco\">San Francisco</h2><p>While a portion of the team was in Vegas for Money2020 and WCC, another portion was already in San Francisco for the start of the San Francisco Blockchain Week. Epicenter, the week’s main and last event, is where Particl held a booth for two days as well as a 30-minute talk. But in no way was it the only event of interest!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-AQI1srPnv0aVadXpHrS-YQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>The city was literally buzzing about blockchain and the many events attracted the entirety of the local, but very front running, San Francisco-based cryptocurrency community. It really felt home! Let’s not forget San Francisco and the Bay Area, in general, is the homeland of startups and the heart of the tech industry. People from all around the world join together with the hopes of creating the next new groundbreaking technology or project. Particl fits very much within that innovation-focused and very forward-thinking mindset.</p><p>SFBW’s particular type of schedule (having the main event at the very end of the week) proved to be an excellent opportunity for the team to initiate the first points of contact with multiple key people by attending many of the side-events and evening receptions organized all throughout the week. Then, during the two days of Epicenter, came the opportunities to capitalize on these contacts made during the week by demonstrating the marketplace and have more quality time with these people.</p><p>Before Epicenter, the Particl team attended CESC, the San Francisco Blockchain Week’s kickoff event where it set up a table at the location to improvise a quick Particl booth with a couple of computers running the Open Marketplace. As is now usual, the marketplace really impressed and gained great reactions and interest which brought new pairs of eyes on Particl and made new friends around, like the stand-up guys over at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto\"><strong>Cracking Crypto</strong></a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto\">,</a> for example.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-1s_bWqb9sJ0nOJzAx_jmyA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Dr. Kap Giving an Interview to the Cracking Crypto Show</figcaption></figure><p>The team also attended more than a dozen side-events (most of the time, many a night…who needs sleep?) all throughout the week such as receptions organized by Polychain Capital, Pantera Capital, Outliers Ventures, Starfish Network, eToro, Huobi, OceanEx, and more. The connections established at all these events really did set the state for when everybody would be crossing paths again later at Epicenter.</p><h2 id=\"las-vegas\">Las Vegas</h2><p>And so while a portion of the team was in San Francisco for the start of SFBW, Joe Fisher and Cryptoguard were in Las Vegas, to attend <a href=\"https://us.money2020.com/\"><strong>Money2020</strong></a> and the <a href=\"https://worldcryptocon.com/\"><strong>World Crypto Conference (WCC)</strong></a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-0D0gVZM4ldY_H1DLZBPlyw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl Welcomes Bryan Woods, Spend.com’s President, as New Advisor</figcaption></figure><p>At <a href=\"https://us.money2020.com/\">Money2020</a>, a Fintech conference focused on innovations within the payment industry, the focus was entirely on <strong>sealing the deal with a new advisor, Bryan Woods, President at Spend.com.</strong> Spend.com is a team that has been growing closer to the Particl team ever since meeting at the Consensus 2019 booth in New York City.</p><p><strong>The Particl team spent 2 full days working at Spend.com’s booth</strong> (one of the big sponsors of Money2020) to discuss and work on various strategies moving into 2020. <strong>This is a direct follow-up to another in-person trip the team made earlier in October 2019 to meet up with Spend.com.</strong> Meeting once again, at Money2020, allowed both teams to initiate and walk the first steps of a long-term relationship together.

What’s coming next in 2020 will be very methodical and carefully planned, and it’s all about getting that adoption going. Thanks to this US West Coast trip, the team is now equipped with the best resources it could have hoped for at the best time imaginable. Let’s do this! ?</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s Next?</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-SB2ytltBLugFKL1rJVhF_Q.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>The development team has been focused on the next few items, <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b\">as identified a while ago</a>, required before aggressive adoption strategies can start getting a worthy conversion rate. Indeed, the Open Marketplace and Particl Desktop still lack a few features the team would like to have before actively trying to drive users to the marketplace.</p><p>In the meantime, <strong>the communications and strategy team is now embarking in a new phase</strong> to start the onboarding of users as soon as the platform is ready for adoption. The team will be taking part in various internal workshops in Berlin in the coming weeks along with key connections and advisors made throughout the past two weeks. That’s to craft strategies related to the user adoption of the Open Marketplace and the Particl network in general and help the project pivot towards a a more “business” focused phase in the most efficient manner possible.</p><p>It is very clear, <strong>the team is coming back from this US West Coast trip extremely motivated and hungry for success</strong>. A lot of doors are opening up, on all fronts, directly to Particl and also to the blockchain industry itself. The world is receptive to the idea of blockchain technology but cautious due to this now-very-long bear market. It is why the next steps of the way need to be very methodological to seize the most of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-Gbg9aHfYJ9bhiThjAvvKwQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl Team After Epicenter’s Closure</figcaption></figure><p>As you might start to understand simply by reading this post, <strong>this trip marks the beginning of brand new objectives, challenges, and goals for the project.</strong> Think of it as the “war room phase”, the moment where strategies are made and carefully, methodically set in motion.</p><h3 id=\"next-locations-of-the-particl-world-tour\">Next Locations of the Particl World Tour</h3><p>With that in mind, the team is going to be attending, in a smaller capacity, two additional events and then conclude it’s already very worthy Particl World Tour.</p><p>Indeed, you’ll be able to find Particl at <a href=\"https://blockshow.com/\"><strong>Blockshow Asia</strong></a>, in Singapore, and <a href=\"https://www.slush.org/events/helsinki/\"><strong>Slush Helsinki</strong></a>, in Finland.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-cWDe1_sIGidEmR1cFeidDw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>At Blockshow Asia, the same boots-on-the-grounds approach as used during SFBW’s side-events and WCC will be applied. It will be all about establishing the first points of contact and reconvening with key people within the Asian market to get as much insight as possible. Don’t forget, as mentioned in a <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-in-singapore-consensus-asia-a3be041d315e\"><strong>previous blog post</strong></a> on Particl.news, <strong>Singapore is a place of interest for Particl because of new tax regulations being proposed which would make any sale paid for with cryptocurrencies a tax-free event.</strong> It is a direct use-case for buying and selling using cryptocurrencies and a great opportunity for Particl to shine brightly. This is, quite simply, crypto having a clear shot at going mainstream in Singapore…</p><p>At Slush Helsinki, a tech startup/founder focused conference, the team will be operating a booth and meeting up with various advisors and mentors specifically going to the event to help out motivated, young entrepreneurs. The team will consist of Juha Kovanen (Marketplace Lead Developer), Gerlof van Ek (Lead Designer, Developer), Dr. Kapil Amarasinghe (UK Particl Ambassador), and Gloria (Particl’s Communications &#x26; Strategy Team).</p><p>Both these events will allow Particl to receive even more feedback, advice, and resources as it jumps right into its next phase. The timing of it all couldn’t be better!</p><hr><h2 id=\"you-too-can-be-a-part-of-it-\">You, Too, Can Be a Part of it!</h2><p>The best connections happen face-to-face, this is simply how things happen in the space. The people you meet, in-person, by going to conferences and their related side-events are not the same crypto people you meet online. These are the active and focused people working day and night on the blockchain revolution. They are the ones that make it all happen!</p><p><strong>For this reason, the Particl team very strongly encourages you to go out there and attend your local blockchain events.</strong> Crypto is not dead, it’s alive and kicking in a way that might surprise you! The bear market is making innovators more motivated and hungry for success, a feeling that is not always shared by the “online crypto community”. Go out there, meet people face-to-face, and be right in the middle of the biggest revolution of our times (with no hyperbole added here ?).</p><p>After all, meeting other crypto fans and innovators to change the world is just one part of why you should attend these events. The other part is…well, it is so much FUN! Dare try it just once and you’ll be hooked!</p><hr><p>Stay tuned for <strong>more news about Spend.com’s relationship with Particl this coming Thursday, the 14th of November</strong>.

Initially mentioned\n[https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190359593550901248] last Friday by\nDr. Kapil Amarasinghe during his 30-minute talk at SFBW’s Epicenter\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZAmMXEvkPc], this new payment option will\nallow users to easily use Bitcoin as a form of payment on the Open Marketplace.\nThis news is directly in line with Particl’s current focus on adoption (in this\nparticular case, focused on the cryptocurrency crowd) and makes the Open\nMarketplace more accessible than ever, especially to people not currently part\nof the Particl community.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBitcoin Payment Integration\nHow the integration of this new feature will look like is as a separate,\nstandalone BTC-PART exchange module within Particl Desktop. The module will\ninteract with the checkout process but will not be directly integrated as part\nof the full buy flow. It will instead be displayed as a separate page within\nParticl Desktop.\n\nThe reason for this is simple — once BTC is transferred for PART, the received\nPART is always, at least initially, received on a public balance. As you\nprobably already know, the Open Marketplace funds stored on anon balances to be\nable to purchase products and services. And because converting funds from a\npublic balance to an anon one takes 12 confirmations, on top of which more\nconfirmations are added as a result of the exchange’s own confirmations\n(incoming Bitcoin confirmations, for example), the integration, as it currently\nstands, cannot be integrated as a core component of the buy flow in a\nuser-friendly and practical way.\n\nExchange Module…as a Separate Page\nWIP, Interface Subject to Change (Testnet Only Shows PART to PART Exchange, BTC\non Mainnet Only)How the integration of this BTC-PART module will look like is a\nsimple and convenient Exchange accessible right from the left sidebar of Particl\nDesktop! If you recall, on Particl Desktop, the Wallet section of the menu\ncurrently has these four pages: Send/Convert, Receive, History, and Address\nBook. This update will introduce fifth section, Exchange, to the Wallet section\nof the sidebar. This page will also be accessible from any regular wallet,\nmeaning the exchange feature won’t need to be manually activated by the user.\n\nPutting the Exchange page as a standalone page on any type of wallet means\nBitcoin users will be able to fund their wallets with PART using Bitcoin,\nallowing them to use any of the Particl Desktop features that requires a fee to\nbe paid (privacy transaction, community proposals, flagging items, etc).\n\nExchange Module…as Part of the Checkout Process\nWhile the exchange module will be a standalone application, at least for the\nforeseeable future, it will still be integrated into the checkout process and\ninteract with it. The process is simple — simply go through the same process of\npurchasing an item to your cart as you always do. Add an item to your cart,\nconfirm the cart’s content, enter your shipping information, and then land on\nthe order confirmation page. Right at that moment, you will be met with two\nbuttons — one to confirm your order, and the other to be redirected to the\nexchange module. If you do not have enough funds to place your order, then the\n“Confirm Order” button will be greyed out while the Exchange button will\nredirect you to the exchange module.\n\nOnce there, the module will automatically fill up the number of PART necessary\nto pay for your order and tell you exactly how many BTC are required to acquire\nthat many PART coins. You will then be able to send Bitcoin to the exchange\nmodule and receive PART in exchange. Once the exchange is completed, you’ll be\nable to easily come back to the confirmation section of the checkout process and\nsuccessfully place your order.\n\nSo while Bitcoin won’t directly be a “payment option” per se, the exchange\nmodule will still interact with your cart in a way that makes it easier and\nuser-friendly for everyone to get the right amount of PART using BTC.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThis BTC-PART exchange module will not be using atomic swaps of any sort of\ndecentralized exchange method, at least not for its initial integration.\nInstead, it will be plugged into a non-custodial exchange that doesn’t require\nKYC or personal information —SimpleSwap [https://simpleswap.io/].\n\nWIP, Interface Subject to Change (Testnet Only Shows PART to PART Exchange, BTC\non Mainnet Only)The module uses SMSG to relay messages between Particl and the\nSimpleSwap engine. The key part to understand is that this exchange module has\nbeen built using SMSG in a very generic matter, and it could eventually be used\nas the base layers to deploy all sorts of services on Particl (i.e. price\npegging, chat module, etc). This module is likely to be included in the incoming\nParticl SDK which is probably going to see the day somewhere in 2020.\n\nA “per transaction” limit function has also been integrated into the module as\nwell, making sure users exchange a number of coins that’s in between the minimum\nand maximum range allowed by the exchange. Most of the information that is\nusually displayed when making a transaction on [https://simpleswap.io/]\nSimpleSwap [https://simpleswap.io/] will also all be displayed right from\nParticl Desktop.\n\nAdditionally, the exchange module will also include an “auto-anonymizer” feature\nwhich will allow you to automatically receive your PART on anon balances. This\nadditional privacy feature included in Particl Desktop’s exchange module isn’t\navailable when simply going on [https://simpleswap.io/]SimpleSwap\n[https://simpleswap.io/]’s website. That RingCT exchange perk feature may, or\nmay not, be part of the first iteration of the exchange module, but it is\nalready in development and should follow very shortly after the first release if\nnot immediately ready. Fingers crossed!\n\nFinally, the exchange module is not designed or hardcoded to work only using \n[https://simpleswap.io/]SimpleSwap [https://simpleswap.io/]. That particualr\nexchange was chosen as the initial service provider because of the lack of KYC\nrequirements and the relatively low friction involved in trades. Should new\nexchanges that provide similar benefits list PART, they could be added to the\nmodule, giving users even more options.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll About Adoption and Speed\nThis integration of a BTC-PART payment module is directly in line with the\nteam’s current focus on eliminating the barriers to entry and kickstarting the\nadoption of the Particl network. It significantly increases the potential amount\nof users that can use the Particl ecosystem and makes getting PART as easy as it\nhas ever been.\n\nWIP, Interface Subject to Change (Testnet Only Shows PART to PART Exchange, BTC\non Mainnet Only)While the feature itself is not entirely ready as of the time of\nthis writing, the team has completed the back-end code as well as the testing\nand is currently finalizing the GUI integration. That should be completed within\na few days, and then more testing will be required to make sure its integration\ninto Particl Desktop hasn’t highlighted any new issue. While a definitive\nrelease date cannot be committed to at this moment, we are getting pretty close\nfor the feature to be fully ready. The exchange module will be released as part\nof Particl Desktop 2.3.0.\n\nNote: Particl Desktop 2.2.0 is currently being tested on testnet and should be\nreleased within just a few days. Aside from the new Global Settings feature, it\nwill mostly include bug fixes, flow optimizations, and UI/UX improvements.\nParticl Desktop 2.2.0 and Particl Desktop 2.3.0 are estimated to be released in\nvery close proximity.\n\nThe Pieces are Falling Into Place\nThe Particl team is full steam ahead and working tirelessly on kickstarting the\nadoption of the Particl platform. Stay alert as you can expect some exciting\nnews to be published soon on Particl.news. Suffice to say, the future of Particl\nis looking brighter every day as the pieces of the puzzle are starting to fall\ninto place at a very interesting pace.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Announces-Bitcoin-Exchange-Integration-Into-Particl-Desktop/1-kqXnceUmmgRlUGrFYGulPw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Announces-Bitcoin-Exchange-Integration-Into-Particl-Desktop/1-SvvDdJMh8rUGGY0sr516iQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>WIP, Interface Subject to Change (Testnet Only Shows PART to PART Exchange, BTC on Mainnet Only)</figcaption></figure><p>Today we’re excited to officially announce more details about Particl’s integration of a Bitcoin exchange module into the Particl Desktop client.

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively targeting transformation into hard money.</strong></p><p>At present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget generated by:</p><ul><li>Network transaction fees</li><li>New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).</li></ul><p>Staking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active circulation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new tokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens minted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases - rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by<br>new token issuance (supply inflation).</p><p>In many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism of asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes that we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token for yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked will either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network grows.</p><p>Staking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not actively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity. Staking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value of circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however paradoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are essentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity that brings intrinsic value<br>to the network.</p><p>So if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed towards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully transform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?</p><p>Simple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the frequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively reducing new token issuance.</p><p>Fortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key applications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:</p><h3 id=\"basicswapdex-bsx-\">BasicSwapDex (BSX)</h3><ul><li>Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​</li><li>​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third party<br>integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap) with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</h3><ul><li>Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds utilised in purchasing goods and services.​</li><li>​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.</li></ul><p><strong>In any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development team and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl network otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time.</strong> They are effectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual supply inflation reward decreases.</p><p>I note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation rate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that result in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft currency.</p><p><strong>It is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus on increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability</strong> to create an L1 system whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to adequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful in that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with additional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money<br>than traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other cryptocurrencies currently traded today.</p><p>Regardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community is active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to further propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to 0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency funded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that satisfies my definition of “hard money”.</p><h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2><ul><li>Voting opens: Est.

This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively targeting transformation into hard money.</strong></p><p>At present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget generated by:</p><ul><li>Network transaction fees</li><li>New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).</li></ul><p>Staking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active circulation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new tokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens minted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases - rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by<br>new token issuance (supply inflation).</p><p>In many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism of asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes that we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token for yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked will either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network grows.</p><p>Staking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not actively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity. Staking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value of circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however paradoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are essentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity that brings intrinsic value<br>to the network.</p><p>So if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed towards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully transform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?</p><p>Simple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the frequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively reducing new token issuance.</p><p>Fortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key applications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:</p><h3 id=\"basicswapdex-bsx-\">BasicSwapDex (BSX)</h3><ul><li>Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​</li><li>​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third party<br>integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap) with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</h3><ul><li>Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds utilised in purchasing goods and services.​</li><li>​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.</li></ul><p><strong>In any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development team and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl network otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time.</strong> They are effectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual supply inflation reward decreases.</p><p>I note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation rate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that result in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft currency.</p><p><strong>It is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus on increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability</strong> to create an L1 system whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to adequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful in that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with additional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money<br>than traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other cryptocurrencies currently traded today.</p><p>Regardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community is active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to further propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to 0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency funded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that satisfies my definition of “hard money”.</p><h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2><ul><li>Voting opens: Est.
