only because it’s\nParticl’s second anniversary. No, there is indeed some very exciting news that\nis now ready to be shared. Are you ready to unwrap that intel gift?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Open Marketplace Updates\nAll of the bugs that have been identified during the last testnet run (with\nblinded escrow) have been fixed. As it stands right now, we would feel 100%\nconfident to release, on mainnet, the Open Marketplace with blinded escrows. The\nproduct is stable, secure, and runs very smoothly.\n\nAll there is left to do, now, is to finish the integration of the RingCT\nprotocol into the escrow system of the marketplace so that all transactions can\nbe completely untraceable.\n\nNew Marketplace Testnet Build Releases Next Week\nAs you probably are well aware by now, the 16th of July hardfork has been\nsuccessfully completed, meaning both the RingCT and Bulletproofs protocols are\nnow available on mainnet.\n\nAnd because the OMP Library had initially been coded with RingCT in the first\nplace, the integration of this privacy protocol into the escrow system has been\npretty quick to go through. Of course, it was necessary for Quarkslab to\ncomplete its audit of MLSAG and Bulletproofs before integrating these two\nprotocols into a live version of the marketplace, but as the results were\npublished on the 5th of July (with the actual report being received by the\nParticl team a few days prior), it took just a few days for the Particl\ndevelopers to bake in the integration into the back-end.\n\nThe team is currently running tests and making a few tweaks that are required to\nensure the integration is as stable as the blinded escrow system was. We are\nestimating that these tweaks will only take a few days to complete, which would\nbring the next testnet build of the Open Marketplace, with full anon (RingCT)\nescrow, to somewhere within the next week. As always, this isn’t a hard\ndeadline, but this is what we are targeting and feeling confident about at this\nmoment.\n\nThis build will contain fixes for all the bugs and issues identified last week\nas well as the new RingCT-powered escrow system. This new testing round will\nallow you to see how the marketplace will look like once it hits mainnet, but it\nwill also allow you to earn a few PART!\n\nTwo Bug Bounties\nAt the same moment as the release of the new testnet build, two bug bounties\nwill officially start —one for the testnet marketplace build, and the other as a\npermanent, general bug bounty for mainnet.\n\nThe testnet bug bounty is pretty self-explanatory: earn PART for finding bugs\nthat remain in the latest version of the testnet build. This bug bounty, which \nwill run for two weeks, is put in place specifically to ensure that the first\nmainnet release of the Open Marketplace is as smooth as possible and that the\ncode is entirely secure. Note that, as bugs and issues are identified, it is\nlikely that there will be more than one build posted throughout the duration of\nthe bug bounty.\n\nThe second bounty, the permanent one, is a mainnet bounty that’s going to stay\nposted on Particl’s official website [http://particl.io]. This bounty is\ndedicated to incentivizing people to find bugs, vulnerabilities, or issues, and\nproperly disclose them to the Particl team in exchange for compensation for\ntheir work and contribution. More information about the bounty will be given\nwhen it is published on particl.io [http://particl.io], which is going to be on\nthe same day as the release of the next testnet marketplace build.\n\nGenerating Market Keys (Advanced Users can Start TODAY)\nAs the back-end code of the marketplace is now ready for launch, with RingCT\nescrow now baked in, it is now possible for anyone to start generating their\nvery own market keys using the repository (and its README.md file) linked just\nbelow.\n\nparticl/particl-market [https://github.com/particl/particl-market]\nParticl Marketplace. Contribute to particl/particl-market development by\ncreating an account on GitHub. [https://github.com/particl/particl-market]\ngithub.com [https://github.com/particl/particl-market]\n\n> Note: The Particl team has been building testnet and mainnet builds for\nconferences and community/internal testing using this repository, but they\nhaven’t been fully anon until after the hardfork.\nA market key, or Market ID, is a unique stream of characters and numbers which\ngives you access to a marketplace. These are, in reality, “private markets” that\nanyone can create. These markets can only be accessed by those who possess the\nkey, after which they gain full permissions over it (purchase products, list\nitems, flag undesirable content, etc).\n\nBootstrapping the Public Interface of the Open Marketplace\nGenerating a market key is important as the Particl team itself isn’t going to\nlaunch the marketplace. In fact, the Particl team is giving the opportunity for\nanyone in the community to create their own market key, push it on Github, and\nhave it be selected as the default key for the public interface of the\nmarketplace. In other words, the default key for the marketplace is going to be\n100% community-powered.\n\nYou see, on Particl, there is no difference between a private and a public\nmarket. The public interface of the Open Marketplace is merely a private market\nwhich has its key set as the default key on the Particl Desktop client. Any\nprivate market could be set as the default market, and this is the opportunity\nthat you will have as a community member.\n\nDon’t worry, there is no risk associated with integrating a community’s market\nkey as the default market. This is nothing like a trusted setup, and the market\nkey’s creator won’t have any sort of special access or permission over the\nmarketplace once the generated key gets merged. It’s not a master key.\n\nFor the next few days, it will be up to the more advanced users to figure out\nhow to generate market keys for themselves (following the instructions of the\nREADME.md file and the folder structure should give you enough hints on how to\ndo it). Then, in a few days, we’ll be giving out more details on how to do it so\nthat more people can join the fun.\n\nParticl Desktop 2.0 Releases on August 12, 2019\nOn the 12th of August, if everything goes well and no critical or significant\nbug is found on next week’s fully anon marketplace testnet build, Particl\nDesktop 2.0 will be released on mainnet.\n\nParticl Desktop 2.0, as it’s version number implies, is a pretty big milestone\nfor the project. Not only will it contain many new features (i.e. multi-wallets,\ncommunity proposals, etc) and UI/UX improvements that have been on testnet ever\nsince, but it will also be fully compatible with the Particl Open Marketplace,\non mainnet.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is it! This is the final burst to the finish line.\n\nWhat is tremendously exciting is that this isn’t actually the end by any means,\nbut rather the beginning of a new phase for Particl.\n\nWith the Particl Open Marketplace on mainnet fostering private, decentralized,\nand permissionless eCommerce, we are excited to see how vendors and buyers alike\nwill use the available features.\n\nSo get ready! The months of July and August will be ones to remember for a very\nlong time!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Second-Anniversary/1-3aInZ5BQOBAdR3s0ESIbig.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"let-s-celebrate-\">Let’s celebrate! ??</h3><p>Today is Particl’s second anniversary, and there are plenty of good reasons to take a moment and celebrate.</p><p>This blog post is definitely a celebratory one.

No, <strong>there is indeed some very exciting news that is now ready to be shared</strong>. Are you ready to unwrap that intel gift?</p><hr><h2 id=\"particl-open-marketplace-updates\">Particl Open Marketplace Updates</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Second-Anniversary/1-S_fPVIak-t6K7ukw7LoCDA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>All of the bugs that have been identified during the last testnet run (with blinded escrow) have been fixed. As it stands right now, <strong>we would feel 100% confident to release, on mainnet, the Open Marketplace with blinded escrows</strong>. The product is stable, secure, and runs very smoothly.</p><p>All there is left to do, now, is to finish the integration of the RingCT protocol into the escrow system of the marketplace so that all transactions can be completely untraceable.</p><h3 id=\"new-marketplace-testnet-build-releases-next-week\">New Marketplace Testnet Build Releases Next Week</h3><p>As you probably are well aware by now, the 16th of July hardfork has been successfully completed, meaning both the RingCT and Bulletproofs protocols are now available on mainnet.</p><p>And because the OMP Library had initially been coded with RingCT in the first place, the integration of this privacy protocol into the escrow system has been pretty quick to go through. Of course, it was necessary for Quarkslab to complete its audit of MLSAG and Bulletproofs before integrating these two protocols into a live version of the marketplace, but as the results were published on the 5th of July (with the actual report being received by the Particl team a few days prior), it took just a few days for the Particl developers to bake in the integration into the back-end.</p><p>The team is currently running tests and making a few tweaks that are required to ensure the integration is as stable as the blinded escrow system was. We are estimating that these tweaks will only take a few days to complete, which would bring the next testnet build of the Open Marketplace, with full anon (RingCT) escrow, to somewhere within the next week. As always, this isn’t a hard deadline, but this is what we are targeting and feeling confident about at this moment.</p><p>This build will contain fixes for all the bugs and issues identified last week as well as the new RingCT-powered escrow system. This new testing round will allow you to see how the marketplace will look like once it hits mainnet, but it will also allow you to earn a few PART!</p><h3 id=\"two-bug-bounties\">Two Bug Bounties</h3><p>At the same moment as the release of the new testnet build, two bug bounties will officially start — <strong>one for the testnet marketplace build, and the other as a permanent, general bug bounty for mainnet</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>testnet bug bounty</strong> is pretty self-explanatory: earn PART for finding bugs that remain in the latest version of the testnet build. This bug bounty, which <strong>will run for two weeks</strong>, is put in place specifically to ensure that the first mainnet release of the Open Marketplace is as smooth as possible and that the code is entirely secure. Note that, as bugs and issues are identified, it is likely that there will be more than one build posted throughout the duration of the bug bounty.</p><p>The second bounty, the permanent one, is a <strong>mainnet bounty</strong> that’s going to stay posted on <a href=\"http://particl.io\">Particl’s official website</a>. This bounty is dedicated to incentivizing people to find bugs, vulnerabilities, or issues, and properly disclose them to the Particl team in exchange for compensation for their work and contribution. More information about the bounty will be given when it is published on <a href=\"http://particl.io\">particl.io</a>, which is going to be on the same day as the release of the next testnet marketplace build.</p><h3 id=\"generating-market-keys-advanced-users-can-start-today-\">Generating Market Keys (Advanced Users can Start TODAY)</h3><p>As the back-end code of the marketplace is now ready for launch, with RingCT escrow now baked in, it is now possible for anyone to start generating their very own market keys using the repository (and its README.md file) linked just below.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-market\"><strong>particl/particl-market</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-market\"><em>Particl Marketplace. Contribute to particl/particl-market development by creating an account on GitHub.</em></a><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-market\">github.com</a></p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> The Particl team has been building testnet and mainnet builds for conferences and community/internal testing using this repository, but they haven’t been fully anon until after the hardfork.</blockquote><p>A market key, or Market ID, is a unique stream of characters and numbers which gives you access to a marketplace. These are, in reality, “private markets” that anyone can create. These markets can only be accessed by those who possess the key, after which they gain full permissions over it (purchase products, list items, flag undesirable content, etc).</p><h3 id=\"bootstrapping-the-public-interface-of-the-open-marketplace\">Bootstrapping the Public Interface of the Open Marketplace</h3><p>Generating a market key is important as the Particl team itself isn’t going to launch the marketplace. In fact, the Particl team is giving the opportunity for anyone in the community to create their own market key, push it on Github, and have it be selected as the default key for the public interface of the marketplace. In other words, the default key for the marketplace is going to be 100% community-powered.</p><p>You see, on Particl, there is no difference between a private and a public market. The public interface of the Open Marketplace is merely a private market which has its key set as the default key on the Particl Desktop client. Any private market could be set as the default market, and this is the opportunity that you will have as a community member.</p><p>Don’t worry, there is no risk associated with integrating a community’s market key as the default market. This is nothing like a trusted setup, and the market key’s creator won’t have any sort of special access or permission over the marketplace once the generated key gets merged. It’s not a master key.</p><p>For the next few days, it will be up to the more advanced users to figure out how to generate market keys for themselves (following the instructions of the README.md file and the folder structure should give you enough hints on how to do it). Then, in a few days, we’ll be giving out more details on how to do it so that more people can join the fun.</p><h2 id=\"particl-desktop-2-0-releases-on-august-12-2019\">Particl Desktop 2.0 Releases on August 12, 2019</h2><p>On the 12th of August, if everything goes well and no critical or significant bug is found on next week’s fully anon marketplace testnet build, Particl Desktop 2.0 will be released on mainnet.</p><p>Particl Desktop 2.0, as it’s version number implies, is a pretty big milestone for the project. Not only will it contain many new features (i.e. multi-wallets, community proposals, etc) and UI/UX improvements that have been on testnet ever since, but it will also be fully compatible with the Particl Open Marketplace, on mainnet.</p><hr><p>This is it! This is the final burst to the finish line.</p><p>What is tremendously exciting is that this isn’t actually the end by any means, but rather the beginning of a new phase for Particl.</p><p>With the Particl Open Marketplace on mainnet fostering private, decentralized, and permissionless eCommerce, we are excited to see how vendors and buyers alike will use the available features.</p><p><strong>So get ready! The months of July and August will be ones to remember for a very long time!</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Second-Anniversary/1-fJlNhXY7IcQiUzAyqmbTGA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":["kg-card","kg-image-card"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Second-Anniversary/1-3aInZ5BQOBAdR3s0ESIbig.jpeg","className":["kg-image"],"alt":""},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"let-s-celebrate-"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Let’s celebrate! ??"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Today is Particl’s second anniversary, and there are plenty of good reasons to take a moment and celebrate."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This blog post is definitely a celebratory one.

Devices, apps,\nnetworks, and retailers are becoming increasingly talkative with each other, and\nit just so happens that the topic of conversation is, well, you.\n\nSwimming in an Ocean of Data\nIf you look closely, there’s a common thread between your phone and that\nseemingly innocuous browser ad plugging Nike shoes the day after you visited a\nNike shop. Your live data runs straight into the clutches of the data-harvesting\napps populating your devices, manifesting itself later on in the form of eerily\naccurate ads and suggestions.\n\nAs life becomes increasingly digital, you’re leaving a virtual trail with each\nmove. Every moment of every day, your devices log your actions, save the data,\nand sell it to the highest bidder. Your hour-long stop at Whole Foods grocery\nstore after work, the route you took to get there, the Spotify playlist you\nlistened to on the drive, the Amazon Prime purchase you made — none of it goes\nunrecorded, and all of it is sold by the very apps, networks, and devices you\ntrust.\n\nYour data forms countless streams that funnel into an invisible ocean of data.\nThat is true for anyone who regularly accesses the internet, uses apps, or owns\na smartphone. While some of it can’t be readily interpreted just yet (such as\nyour Instagram photos and voice messages), the technology for mining it is\nrapidly maturing.\n\nIt’s All in the Fine Print — Or, Is It?\nThe obvious question to ask is — who wants this data, and why?\n\nFor retailers, governments, and social networks, getting to know you is a\nlucrative business. Your raw personal data translates directly into money and \npower for internet giants like Facebook, who benefit immensely from doing\nsketchy things like recording your conversations and phone calls.\n\nAs the world’s leading data broker, Acxiom buys data wholesale and unloads it to\nother businesses for consumer targeting. After clearing over $1 billion in sales\nlast year, Acxiom sold their company for $2 billion. All of that profit is built\nfrom data you generated — your personal experience, whether on the web or\notherwise, is no longer yours because you don’t own it.\n\nSome argue that because of the fine print in the terms and conditions when you\ncreate app accounts, all of this is known. However, did you agree to the box\nthat said Facebook would sell your data to a company using it to interfere in\nelections throughout the world? Of course not, because that box wasn’t an\noption. That didn’t stop Facebook from selling the personal data of 87 million\nusers to Cambridge Analytica, a company directly implicated in using it to\ninfluence the outcome of the 2016 US election.\n\nCan You Really Control What Happens of Your Data?\nAmazon, the world’s largest online retailer, allows third-party sellers on its\nplatform. Over 30% of those sellers are China-based and use payment platforms\nsuch as LianLian. Payment processors have direct access to a seller’s account\nand can, therefore, collect buyer data as well. With a massive share of the\nworld’s largest retail network, Chinese payment processors have every incentive\nto harvest and sell your data for additional revenue.\n\nQuora, Uber, Equifax, eBay, Google, T-Mobile, Microsoft, and countless other\napps, services, and platforms used worldwide are all cashing in on the big data\nbusiness that is worth, all told, an estimated $250 billion a year.\n\nWhen your data is sold, it isn’t tagged or tracked. It flows down the bottomless\nrabbit holes of the internet, and where it ends up is anyone’s guess. One\ncompany may use your data for micro-targeting while another uses it to fuel its\npredictive analytics.\n\nThe moment you do anything that can be digitally represented, that action is\ntransmuted into data and immediately trades hands.\n\n> …your personal experience, whether on the web or otherwise, is no longer yours\nbecause you don’t own it.\nTo make matters even worse, companies all along the data-mining supply chain are\noften targeted by hackers. Since data storage is a relatively recent phenomenon,\nit’s also very loosely regulated and lacks guidelines for the protection of\nsensitive information. When a breach occurs, stolen data that includes your\nbanking details, home address, text messages, phone numbers, transactions,\nlocation history, and more is at risk of being used against you.\n\nAs the scandals surrounding data have grown in scale, so too has the push to\nmake each of us the rightful owners of our data.\n\nAre Decentralized Marketplaces a Better Way?\nData-mining is by and large done with the specific intention of getting better\nat selling you things. The more retailers know about what you want, the better\nthey can hone in on you and convince you to spend. This is specifically why the\neCommerce sector has become so keen on data mining.\n\nThanks to Satoshi and the blockchain, a new form of marketplace has risen over\nthe last few years. Did you know Satoshi had begun working on a decentralized\nmarketplace\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/5253d1ab77fab1995ede03fb934edd67f1359ba8]\n, entirely built on Bitcoin, before disappearing?\n\nDecentralized marketplaces look and feel like their centralized counterparts,\nbut they’re intended to give you full control over your data and, therefore,\ncomplete privacy. However, do they really improve upon the problem they’re\nsupposed to fix — or do they make it worse?\n\nDecentralized marketplaces run on public blockchains. The key word here is \npublic— meaning that your valuable information can be tracked and harvested by\nanyone with access to a block explorer. Complicating the situation are\nblockchain analytics firms that have become sophisticated enough to track down\nyour full transaction history, IP address, and personal details.\n\nDubious blockchain analytics startups are being bought out en masse by\nexchanges\nlike Coinbase\n[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3bn5e/coinbase-neutrino-former-hacking-team-members?utm_source=reddit.com] \nwhile others breeze through high-dollar funding rounds. Data-mining has already\nproven to be extremely lucrative in the traditional e-commerce world, and\nblockchain has shown itself a worthy of replacing traditional networks. If you\nput two and two together, the reason for the current blockchain analytics gold\nrush is clear as day.\n\nToday’s blockchain analytics firms are tomorrow’s big data-harvesting\ncenters — and decentralized marketplaces without privacy measures in place won’t\nbe safe.\n\nTowards a Decentralized AND Private Marketplace\nInspired by the decentralized marketplace forebearers such as OpenBazaar, it\nseems that the only answer to the assault on our privacy is to take the\nblockchain marketplace model a step further and make it private by default.\n\nParticl [https://particl.io] is a blockchain analysis-resistant marketplace that\nis both decentralized and private. Your transaction details and identity are\nkept entirely anonymous — no one, no matter how hard they try, can collect your\ndata when you use the Particl platform.\n\nThat means your data is yours— it’ll never end up as runoff trickling into a\nmurky data silo someplace. Sure, we’ve heard critics claim that if you’ve got\nnothing to hide, then there’s no use for privacy. Unfortunately, such arguments\nmiss the point.\n\nBy hiding your data when buying or selling online, you aren’t implicitly\nadmitting to shady activity. You’re reclaiming the value inherent in your data\nand strengthening your digital autonomy. In the physical world, you wouldn’t\nstand for being followed or robbed — so why let those things happen to your\ndigital self?\n\nIn the digital era, data ownership is a fundamental human right, but we need the\ntools and resources for exercising that right. Particl Open Marketplace is just\nsuch a resource, and by using it, you stand up for not only your data but also\nthat of your peers.","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Privacy-in-eCommerce---The-Need-to-Own-Your-Data/1-WppvYxW6cEpVySkXEJRezQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>The world is an interconnected, nay, <em>hyper-connected</em> place.

While online vendors should be rejoicing about such an\napparently prosperous state of affairs, many are wringing their hands and\nwondering about tomorrow.\n\nOnline retail is a notoriously competitive industry due to retail titans going\ntoe-to-toe with small vendors. Amazon, eBay, Alibaba, Rakuten, and others\nharvest sales data before interpreting it with algorithms. This helps them\nidentify the most in-demand products, who is likely to buy them, and what\nproducts offer the best return on investments. Once those products are\ndetermined, this is where it gets ugly.\n\nAmazon’s Data-Driven Monopoly\nAmazon currently hosts upwards of 5 million vendors on their marketplace. You’d\nthink that with numbers like that, they’d be happy to collect a percentage of\nthe roughly $100 billion earned by those sellers in 2018. However, billions in\nprofit year on year and federal tax waivers aren’t enough to satisfy the\ngiant — Amazon wants your fees, your business, and you out of the game.\n\nAs a vendor, finding the right niche for your range of products is your bread\nand butter. All of the legwork it takes to find that niche means countless hours\nspent doing market research, outreach, and honing your business through trial\nand error. Amazon, on the other hand, is already three steps ahead of you. Their\nultra-fast algorithms perpetually scan billions of datasets floating across the\ninternet to identify trends. Predictive analysis techniques derived from their\nmillions of daily users give them a vast trove of information used to identify\nemerging trends.\n\nAll told, Amazon’s market momentum is built-in — they know what a buyer is going\nto buy before the buyer does, and the ship keeps sailing right along. Amazon’s\ncompounding centralization of retail power is their bottomless bags of\nmoney — they can afford to spare no expense in gathering the brightest minds to\nbuild their data analysis and AI tools. The result is a classic vicious cycle,\nas described by Kai-Fu Lee, an AI specialist:\n\n> “The more data you have, the better your product; the better your product, the\nmore data you can collect; the more data you can collect, the more talent you\ncan attract; the more talent you can attract, the better your product.” —\nKai-Fu Lee\n[https://www.feedbackexpress.com/amazon-1029528-new-sellers-year-plus-stats/]\nThe Blueprint of How Amazon Destroys Businesses\nAmazon, among other marketplaces, possesses all the data it needs to become the\nmost successful online vendor. It uses its sheer power to manufacture copies of\nthe best selling or most profitable items under its brand. It also accurately\ntargets shoppers with ads and product suggestions of the copied product. And,\nperhaps the most effective and nastiest of practices, it takes the listing of\nthe vendor it copied the product from and puts it way down in the list of\nresults. You were a successful vendor with an item rocking the top section of\nthe first page? Well, no more! Enjoy page 5 or 6. All of these practices ensure\nAmazon gets the cake and eat it too while severely undercutting the success of\nits own vendors.\n\nWhile using giant retail platforms may be convenient, they’re culling your vital\nbusiness data and using it to compete directly against you — all while you’re\npaying their high seller fees. Let’s get that clear here, vendors not only get\ntheir ideas and inventions stolen from them, they actually pay Amazon to do all\nthe research and market penetration testing for them.\n\nMarket efficiency is one thing, but market dictatorship is another. Amazon’s\ndata-driven monopoly is like a black hole at the center of the eCommerce\nuniverse — nothing escapes its pull. With no real competition, Amazon is left\nunrivaled to dictate trends and run circles around your business.\n\nKnocking Independent Retailers Out\nAmazon has unlimited access to both vendor and buyer analytics despite making\nvery few mentions of data collection in their terms and conditions. Imagine you\nhad access to an untold wealth of information regarding the exact product you’re\nputting on the market. With the who, what, when, and where sorted out, you’d be\nwell off. With the additional ability to instantly take the competition out of\nthe game, you’d then be an omniscient retail god — like Amazon.\n\nEvery time you make a sale, all of the data associated with it is bundled and\nparsed for actionable information. Amazon looks at both micro and macro trends\nsuch as how products are performing over time and what are their estimated\nrevenue. Remember, all of these calculations are automated by way of algorithms\nand use relevant, real-time customer spending habits and competitor data. These\nbits of information paint a picture of your items that lets Amazon know whether\nor not your particular product is ripe for copying.\n\nThe odds of your product being singled out increase the more popular your\nproduct is. While that in itself would normally make a retailer jump for joy,\nit’s become a cause for concern instead. Having a successful product means it’s\nalmost certain that your product will reappear at a lower price under the Amazon\nBasics brand — a benign-sounding name that belies the bane it’s become to\nvendors.\n\nDecentralizing the Global Marketplace\nThe issue mentioned in this article not only speaks about the lack of privacy in\ntraditional eCommerce but also about the problems introduced by omnipotent\ncentral authorities.\n\nBlockchain has given the world a new way to exchange value and conduct business\nwithout relying on any intermediary at all. It is nothing short of an economic\nparadigm shift. The significance of this shift has everything to do with\nempowering you with your original autonomy. In a centralized financial paradigm,\nyou have no choice but to rely on the myriad institutions built to give you one\noption — use them.\n\nThe decentralized paradigm made possible by blockchain is the opposite. You’re\nthe sovereign actor in your own financial universe. The blockchain is a thread\nconnecting you directly to your peers — rendering the middleman useless in the\nprocess. Clearly, blockchain is the perfect vehicle for launching a global\nmarketplace that is at once decentralized and entirely trustworthy. Sound a bit\ntoo good to be true? Well, that’s because it is.\n\nThe problem is also what makes blockchain so great for other applications: it’s\na publicly viewable ledger that permanently records all transaction data going\nthrough its system. In a public ledger, all of your transactions are on display,\nas if under the sun on a clear day. A marketplace using a public blockchain\nwould be \nhttps://www.technologyreview.com/s/611425/its-time-to-rein-in-the-data-barons/ 2\ndoing Amazon and other blue-chip retailers a massive favor — they’ll get a\nsharper view of the retail sector and get even more data.\n\nMoreover, like sharks that smell blood from miles away, data miners have begun\nallocating resources to the blockchain, forming analysis groups that are raking\nin big venture capital dollars (along with a few government contracts for good\nmeasure). Blockchain analysis groups specialize in matching ledger data to user\nidentities or trends. As compliance regulations surrounding cryptocurrency\nevolve, blockchain analysis firms will play a key role in harvesting and\nanalyzing your data.\n\nSo to very briefly summarize, centralized eCommerce platforms like Amazon and\ndecentralized marketplaces have enough serious issues that, as a vendor, you may\nbe feeling hopeless. However, fret not — there’s a new eCommerce platform that\nprotects your data, your products, and your livelihood.\n\nParticl’s Open Marketplace — Privacy by Default & True Decentralization\nParticl’s Open Marketplace — 100% decentralized and privateTo put an end to the\nmisuse of data once and for all, the Particl team banded together to build a\nfully decentralized and private marketplace. Decentralization is the way to go,\nbut it needs a key ingredient to really thrive for eCommerce\napplications — privacy.\n\nParticl boasts the many benefits associated with blockchain but adds something\nthat no other marketplace can claim: private-by-default transactions and zero\ndata trail. Private-by-default transactions mean that only you know what you\nsell. No longer will your precious data be harvested and used to undercut you\nfurther down the road. No longer do you have to worry that an all-seeing AI is\nmonitoring your account and waiting for you to do market research.\n\nParticl gives you the leverage and the freedom necessary to finally be the\nvendor you set out to be. Selling products online on Particl’s Open Marketplace\nis just like making in-person sales paid for with cash. You’re free to connect\nwith a community on a peer-to-peer basis and you’re free to do it in full\nconfidentiality. This is what marketplaces used to be and should revert back\nto — a common place where people come together and exchange to the benefit of\nall.\n\nWe didn’t set out to create the next monopoly — we set out to render the current\nones obsolete.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Privacy-in-eCommerce---Protect-Your-Business/1-kbwaBKaJ_UL20cGDzGkkrA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"how-privacy-can-help-you-keep-your-business-alive\">How Privacy Can Help You Keep Your Business Alive</h3><p>For online vendors, eCommerce has entered an unparalleled golden age.

I’ve had the\nchance to have several back and forths with him, and have asked him a few\nquestions to let you all know a bit more about our new fellow Particl family\nmember! You can follow him on the following platforms:\n\nGithub: https://github.com/spazzymoto\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-edwards-82464992/\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCould you give a small resume of your professional journey?\n> After school, I’ve started working for a company that does process\ninstrumentation. I was mainly coding front ends that interfaced with the\ndevices. I worked there for around 2 years and then took my “gap year” where I\nwent sailing in the med and the carribean for about 2 years.When I got back to\nSouth Africa, I was chatting to Ryno who told me to come for an interview at the\ncompany he was currently working at, which did financial based software. I got\nthe job there and that is where I spent my last 9 years.\n\nSo where did you meet Ryno initially?\n> I met Ryno years ago, I went to a house party with some friends when we were\nstill in school. Turns out it was at Ryno’s house. We’ve been friends since\nthen.\nWhere does the Spazzymoto username come from?\n> Growing up, I did a lot of sailing with my dad and I think he came up with\nSpazzymoto as the name for one of our boats. I latched on to it as it’s a\nusername no one else uses that I’ve seen, so it makes registering at new\nwebsites really easy.\nHas Particl been your introduction to blockchain development?\n> It has been. I did a course or two at my old company to see how we could\npotentially use blockchain, but these were very high-level overviews.\nWere you personally involved/interested in some way in cryptocurrencies before\nParticl then?\n> Besides owning some cryptocurrencies and following a few, mainly Particl & Nano,\nI wasn’t really involved although it is an area that has always interested me. I\nthink it has massive potential and I can’t wait to see what’s to come.\nWhat do you see as the biggest challenge for cryptocurrencies’ mainstream (or\nwider) adoption?\n> I think the biggest problems I see, in my opinion, are:1) I could explain to my\nparents how to buy Particl, for example. I think massive improvements have been\nmade to make this process easier, but I think we as a community can do better!\n2) I think another issue is convincing people to actually use their crypto on\nthe marketplace instead of just “hodling”. I guess no one wants to spend today\nwhat could be worth a lot more in the future. I think this will get better as\nthe crypto prices stabilize though.\n\nHow did you get to join Particl?\n> After 9 years at my previous company, I felt like Iwas in a bit of a rut/comfort\nzone, that I wasn’t really challenging myself anymore. I therefore took the\nplunge and registered on a South African tech job site to see what was out there\nand if there were any jobs were I felt that I could challenge myself. Low and\nbehold, Ryno found me there and the rest is history as they say.\nWhat makes you the most excited about Particl?\n> I think Particl’s vision, it has a great team of people guiding and working on\nit. I think the marketplace is a great example of the dedication of this team to\ndrive innovation in the crypto space.\nWhat is your fresh/outside perspective on Particl?\n> The thing I love most about Particl compared to, say Bitcoin, is that I see it\nas a green cryptocurrency. The amount of energy being consumed to mine bitcoin\nis outrageous. That, and I feel like Particl consistently pushes the boundaries,\nI can’t wait for the marketplace to hit mainnet.\nDo you plan on personally use it? What would you like to sell or buy the most?\n> I am definitely going to use it, I will have to go see what I can sell, although\nI’m not really sure I’d have anything to sell at this point, but you never know!\nAs for buying, anything that means one less trip to a shopping center! I hate\nshopping centers.\nWhat is your specific role in Particl Desktop? In other words, what is a typical\nday for you working for Particl.\n> My role is to turn coffee into code! I think compared to my previous job, I get\nto actually code a lot more as opposed to all the design & estimation meetings\nthat I was used to. I am new to the project, but I’m hoping I can dig in and\nhelp share the load with the rest of the guys.\nWhat item or part of Particl will you be working on? I’ve heard you were going\nto start on Copay. What updates are you making to it?\n> My first task has been to update the Particl Copay app to the latest version\nfrom Bitpay. This was quite a few commits behind and required some updates to\nthe supporting bitcore wallet service and supporting libraries.Following updates\nwill be: An iOS version, notifications, support for Particl, but also Bitcoin &\nBitcoin Cash wallets, and cold staking.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDue to the team’s almost exclusive focus on marketplace development as of late,\nthe Particl Copay mobile app had been put on the backburner for some time. It’s\ndefinitely going to be refreshing to see all these updates take place for\nParticl’s mobile app, especially the long-awaited iOS version and cold staking\nfeatures.

There is a very simple reason behind it: it’s one of the first\ntime people can actually gain full control over their own money and transact\nwith anyone in the world without requiring the assistance or oversight of any\nthird-party or authority figure. In other words, Bitcoin gives us, the people,\nfinancial and economic freedom like never before.\n\nAs great as it sounds, Bitcoin is still unfortunately pretty dependent on\ncentralized infrastructure, and thus, is having a hard time realizing its\nvision. When you think about it, the moment you want to spend your coins, what\ndo you do? Maybe you transfer them to an exchange, trade them against fiat\ncurrencies, make a withdraw into your bank account, and then, finally, visit an\neCommerce platform to make a purchase. Or maybe you have found some service\ncompany that will accept your coins and buy products on the web on your behalf.\nThat is, in both cases, quite costly in terms of fees, time spent navigating\nthrough all these hoops and, most importantly, still pretty much centralized.\nNot only does this practice goes against everything Bitcoin was created for,\nnamely the vision of a new economy, one that is independent of centralized\nauthorities and third-parties, but it also makes Bitcoin’s adoption as a\ncurrency a dud.\n\nSo how do we fix that problem? How can we fill the gap to adoption and place the\nfinal piece of the puzzle, so to speak? How can we get to the point where we\nwon’t have to exit crypto anymore because spending Bitcoin and other coins will\nbe easier than switching back to the old global fiat economy?\n\nBitcoin’s Missing Piece to its Grand Puzzle\nBitcoin is almost everything a currency should be, but there appears to be\nsomething missing for a true crypto-based economy to flourish and thrive. Of\ncourse, some merchants do accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly and\nwithout intermediary, but they are few and far in between and usually difficult\nto find within all the noise. Because most people value convenience so much,\nthey would rather spend more money and “exit” the crypto ecosystem rather than\ngoing through the hassle of finding these vendors.\n\nThe end result is that, as it stands today, Bitcoin is used for mostly three\nthings: trading/speculation, remittance payments, and store of value. It is\ncertainly debatable how much it is used for actual spending, but one thing is\ncertain: spending Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for products and services\nis, at the moment, considerably more of a hassle than simply using fiat\ncurrencies. This makes cryptocurrencies simply unattractive to most people\noutside the relatively small cryptocurrency community and is one of the main\nreasons it is still not recognized as a serious currency.\n\nWhen we, cryptocurrency enthusiasts, dream about mainstream adoption, we have to\nfirst recognize the challenges we still face to this day. Without Bitcoin and\nother cryptocurrencies being at least as easily, affordably, and conveniently\nspendable as traditional currencies, the cryptocurrency ecosystem is likely to\nremain stuck within its own bubble. The path to mainstream adoption of the\nBitcoin decentralized currency and the independent economy it seeks to create\ncannot rely on the centralized infrastructure of the old global fiat economy.\n\n> The path to mainstream adoption of the Bitcoin decentralized currency and the\nindependent economy it seeks to create cannot rely on the centralized\ninfrastructure of the old global fiat economy.\nWith the Bitcoin cryptocurrency ecosystem and community quickly growing within\nthe last few years, it seems the final roadblock in the path to mainstream\nadoption and the realization of crypto as a truly independent economy is the\nability to be able to easily spend coins without third-party and have it be as\nconvenient and affordable as it would be when spending traditional currencies\nwithin the global fiat economy.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Day Has Come for Crypto to Claim its Independence\nUp until now, and even after all these years, there hasn’t been any clear\nsolution to the issue of not being able to spend Bitcoin and other\ncryptocurrencies with the same freedom and convenience you can transact them.\nMany companies and websites have tried to claim they were allowing people to\neasily spend their coins, but in the end, it always required you to trust that\nentity and pay fees on top of it. Far from ideal!\n\nThere is, however, a project presenting itself as a solid and completely\ntrustless solution to the now decade-old coin spending problem, and could very\nwell help Bitcoin’s adoption as an actual currency. Let’s dive right into what\nmakes this project such a good candidate to be that missing piece of the\nBitcoin’s puzzle.\n\nParticl’s Open Marketplace\nBuilt on the most recent Bitcoin codebase, Particl’s Open Marketplace is a\ndecentralized, fully trustless marketplace specifically designed to work with\nyour favorite cryptocurrency. Imagine a platform similar to eBay, but with no\nintermediary whatsoever, the possibility to use your favorite coin (including\nBitcoin), built with privacy at its core, and with barely any fee. All the good\nstuff from eBay…without the bad stuff! Too good to be true? Absolutely not!\n\nThe absence of any intermediary, just like Bitcoin, allows the Open Marketplace\nto run very effectively without any bias and at a bare minimal cost. The\nbuilt-in privacy features included with the Particl network (RingCT on Bitcoin\ncodebase) and the lack of any sort of data mining also insures that no party,\nsuch as a platform operator or payment processor, can access your personal\ninformation. The only data ever shared with another party is your shipping\naddress to the vendors you’re buying products from.\n\nBuilt on the Bitcoin Codebase\nParticl Open Marketplace is built on the latest Bitcoin codebase, meaning it has\nall the latest features brought forth by the most recent updates to Bitcoin,\nincluding a default integration of Segwit, Lightning Network\n[http://lightning.network]-readiness, as well as being compatible with most of\nthe Bitcoin products out there (i.e. Bitpay’s Copay Bitcoin mobile wallet is\nnamed Particl Copay on the Particl blockchain).\n\nIt is important to note, however, that Particl is not an ICO, not an\nEthereum-token, and runs its very own blockchain in order to have full control\nover its ecosystem. The blockchain was launched in a very fair way years ago and\nis developed by a team of mostly Bitcoin fanatics [http://particl.io/about-us] \nthat have been working in crypto for quite some time and have made names for\nthemselves. Particl’s Github page [http://github.com/particl] is one of the most\nactive one in the entire blockchain industry, and the amount of work being done\non it is tremendous, especially in comparison to other cryptocurrency projects,\nalways ranking in among the top coins in Darpal’s Github Audit Reports\n[https://medium.com/@DPRating].\n\nUse Your Favorite Coin\nStraying away from the counter-productive “tribalism” currently plaguing the\ncrypto industry, Particl Open Marketplace’s underlying protocol is designed to\nwork with your favorite cryptocurrency. While initial versions of the\nmarketplace might only work with PART to begin with, it has been coded in such a\nway that integrating almost any coin to its platform is made trivial. Of course,\nBitcoin is planned to be the first coin introduced to the platform.\n\nTribalism, or the bad habit many people in the crypto industry adopt when\nfighting over “who has the best coin or platform”, is not a philosophy endorsed\nby the Particl team. Contrary to many ICOs and “new” blockchain projects, \nParticl is free for almost any crypto community to use and does not discriminate\nin favor of its native currency. Forcing users to use a native currency is a\nmistake we see way too often now in the industry and a gimmick that is highly\nunappealing to most people. Particl’s Open Marketplace is designed to benefit\nthe entire crypto ecosystem and add utility to all coins!\n\nPrivate-by-Design\nUsing some of the latest privacy technologies in the industry, the Open\nMarketplace is private-by-design, meaning that all purchases and sales made from\nwithin its platform are private by default, regardless of the coin used to make\nthe purchase.\n\nIn fact, Particl has been the first project to integrate RingCT, the privacy\nprotocol made popular by Monero, on the Bitcoin codebase (or any other codebase\nother than Cryptonote, for that matter). Moreover, the entire platform is built\nwith privacy at its core, meaning no data can ever leak out of the platform or\nbe recorded in a publicly auditable fashion on the blockchain, protecting its\nusers from abusive data analysis and industry copycats. Content is stripped of\nall its metadata (i.e. listing pictures) and every aspect of the marketplace is\ndesigned to make transactions and user identities indistinguishable.\nAdditionally, you can start your own private market (currently called “bubbles”)\nand make products available only to those who you send the access key to, making\nthe entire process even more private and completely away from the eyes of\ncompetitors.\n\nRidiculously Low Fees\nParticl’s Initial Fee Schedule (Will Decrease Over Time)What would be the use of\nsuch a marketplace if fees were high? The whole point of this article was to, in\npart, point out how expensive shopping with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies\ncan get because you are forced to use third-parties which, among the many\ndisadvantages they cause, charge users with fees that make spending coins not a\ncost-effective activity. For the crypto economy to really become a viable\noption, fees need to be kept at a minimum, which is exactly the case on\nParticl’s Open Marketplace.\n\nWhile Particl is already very low on fees at this current moment in time, it\nwill ultimately reach its vision and be fully integrated with both scalable and\nentirely trustless solutions which will make it a near-zero fee platform.\nProtocols such as atomic swaps\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atomic-swaps.asp] (already live on mainnet\nsince October 2017), Lightning Network [http://lightning.network], Segwit, and\nothers will make using Particl extremely affordable and as convenient and fast\nas traditional eCommerce platforms.\n\nGenerally speaking, charging vendors with barely any fee, especially when they\nare used to be being abused by traditional platforms, means they will be able to\neither make more profit-per-sale or lower their prices to gain an advantage over\ntheir competitors and get bigger sales volume. The end result for the customer\nis likely to be more affordable products than anywhere else on the web. Fees on\ntraditional eCommerce platforms are outrageous, the new crypto economy is a fair\none that is centered around its users, not the platform’s operator!\n\nNo Intermediary At All\nNo, you are not dreaming. All of this is indeed available without the use of any\nthird-party or central authority whatsoever. Every feature available on the Open\nMarketplace comes from 100% trustless protocols. For example, atomic swaps is\nthe protocol used to enable you to use your favorite coin. The escrow is managed\nthrough a mechanism using a smart-contract and security deposits and is based on\nthe MAD game-theory. The governance (or moderation) of the marketplace’s content\nis entirely controlled by the community.\n\nThere is absolutely no intermediary on Particl, just like there is no\nintermediary involved when transacting Bitcoin from person-to-person. In other\nwords, everything that Bitcoin has which made its cryptocurrency great, Particl\noffers the same but to the eCommerce industry. No intermediary means anything\nyou do within the platform is perfectly secure and untraceable, that your data\nisn’t collected or shared with anyone, and that the platform can be used at a\nbare minimal cost.\n\nAs mentioned earlier in this article, the path to mainstream adoption of the\nBitcoin decentralized currency and the independent economy it seeks to create\ncannot rely on the centralized infrastructure of the old global fiat economy.\n\nEarn Cryptocurrencies While You Sleep\nAnother important aspect of an “economy” is to be able to earn transferable\nvalue (currency) directly within it. This is precisely what Particl makes\npossible.\n\nIn fact, not only can you sell products and services online to earn\ncryptocurrencies without requiring any intermediary, but you also receive the\nentirety of the fees generated by the Particl platform as a coin holder. This\naspect of the platform constitutes a great source of passive income and is\nexpected to get exponentially profitable as the marketplace sees more sales\nvolume per day. This passive income mechanism also applies to all future paid\n(but optional) features of the marketplace such as featured listing spots, for\nexample.\n\nThe Power of Community\nWith Particl’s Open Marketplace, you can expect convenience like never seen\nbefore when looking for vendors that accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nBecause Particl presents itself as a common ground for both vendors and buyers,\nit makes it very easy to find the product or service you are looking for or to\nget the exposure you deserve as a vendor accepting crypto. Looking for\nsomething? Just type what you wish to purchase in the search bar, and be exposed\nto a multitude of vendors selling what you need. Selling stuff? Just list your\nproducts on the Open Marketplace and instantly get the exposure you deserve in\nfront of the right target audience. Gone are the days spent digging through\nsearch engines and advertising your business on obscure cryptocurrency forums,\nthe world is now at your fingertips and is available at minimum effort!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Building Blocks of the New Economy\nBitcoin and Particl’s Open Marketplace are entirely complementary and made to\nlive side-by-side. If we were to compare the new, independent economy made\npossible by Bitcoin and Particl to a house, Bitcoin would be its cornerstone (or\nits foundation) while Particl would the support beams. Bitcoin is what started\nit all (the cornerstone), but without its support beams, the house would not be\nable to stand ground for much longer, let alone withstand severe storms of FUD\nand speculation-led bear markets.\n\nBe Part of the Solution\nThe mainnet release of Particl Open Marketplace is rapidly approaching, and the\ndays where Bitcoin was stuck within its own bubble caused by the inconvenience\nof spending coins are now coming to an end. With a super convenient, affordable,\neye-candy, and trustless solution to spend coins about to see the day, now is\nthe time to get involved!\n\nParticl Open Marketplace is currently undergoing heavy testing on public testnet\nand is nearing its Beta release, and we need you now more than ever! Come to\njoin our community, connect with other pioneers of the new, independent economy,\nand spread the word around. We now stand at the forefront of one of the biggest\nfinancial revolution to ever see the day: the birth of the first truly global\nand independent economy powered by Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Bitcoin---Particl--Building-an-Independent-Economy-Together/1-LejDfDLZGzsWcTxixmLHzA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Bitcoin is often considered the most important technological breakthrough since the internet.

Of course, some merchants do accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly and without intermediary, but they are few and far in between and usually difficult to find within all the noise.

It is certainly debatable how much it is used for actual spending, but one thing is certain: spending Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for products and services is, at the moment, considerably more of a hassle than simply using fiat currencies. This makes cryptocurrencies simply unattractive to most people outside the relatively small cryptocurrency community and is one of the main reasons it is still not recognized as a serious currency.</p><p>When we, cryptocurrency enthusiasts, dream about mainstream adoption, we have to first recognize the challenges we still face to this day. Without Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies being at least as easily, affordably, and conveniently spendable as traditional currencies, the cryptocurrency ecosystem is likely to remain stuck within its own bubble.

All the good stuff from eBay…without the bad stuff! Too good to be true? Absolutely not!</p><p>The absence of any intermediary, just like Bitcoin, allows the Open Marketplace to run very effectively without any bias and at a bare minimal cost. The built-in privacy features included with the Particl network (RingCT on Bitcoin codebase) and the lack of any sort of data mining also insures that <strong>no party</strong>, such as a platform operator or payment processor, <strong>can access your personal information</strong>. The only data ever shared with another party is your shipping address to the vendors you’re buying products from.</p><h3 id=\"built-on-the-bitcoin-codebase\"><strong>Built on the Bitcoin Codebase</strong></h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Bitcoin---Particl--Building-an-Independent-Economy-Together/1-t2vpHIAhhHL09kj6CLmGjg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Particl Open Marketplace is built on the latest Bitcoin codebase, meaning it has all the latest features brought forth by the most recent updates to Bitcoin, including a default integration of Segwit, <a href=\"http://lightning.network\"><strong>Lightning Network</strong></a>-readiness, as well as being compatible with most of the Bitcoin products out there (i.e. Bitpay’s Copay Bitcoin mobile wallet is named Particl Copay on the Particl blockchain).</p><p>It is important to note, however, that Particl is <strong>not an ICO</strong>, <strong>not an Ethereum-token</strong>, and runs its very own blockchain in order to have full control over its ecosystem.

Of course, Bitcoin is planned to be the first coin introduced to the platform.</p><p>Tribalism, or the bad habit many people in the crypto industry adopt when fighting over “who has the best coin or platform”, is not a philosophy endorsed by the Particl team. Contrary to many ICOs and “new” blockchain projects, <strong>Particl is free for almost any crypto community to use and does not discriminate in favor of its native currency</strong>. Forcing users to use a native currency is a mistake we see way too often now in the industry and a gimmick that is highly unappealing to most people.

Content is stripped of all its metadata (i.e. listing pictures) and every aspect of the marketplace is designed to make transactions and user identities indistinguishable.

Kewde, who used to assume that role, has\nbeen moved over to Particl Core to work together with Tecnovert on some\ncryptography and core related tasks.\n\nMore widely known as zaSmilingIdiot [https://github.com/zaSmilingIdiot] within\nthe community, as per Arnold’s Github username, he has impressed quite a few\npeople by his development methodologies and insightful Github posts. Following\non lots of requests from the community, I’ve sat down earlier this week with\nArnold to run a small interview and give him the opportunity to introduce\nhimself to the community.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCould you give a small resume of your professional journey?\n> I started out doing what essentially would be IT Support for a couple of months\nbefore moving on to a more technical role with some development work, to\neventually doing full-time dev work. I cut my teeth with Java, and then jumped\nship to Python when the product I was involved with at the time started making\nthe move to becoming a Javascript-based platform instead. At the time I had no\nlove or want of involvement in JS. How things change…Interestingly, the company\nI had migrated to were doing some decent work with putting together their UI’s,\nand my interest piqued and I figured that javascript couldn’t be so bad after\nall (although, to clarify, I believe I might have had a tainted perspective\ngiven my previous exposure to Java). So I started becoming more actively\ninvolved in that side of things. Fast forward a few years, and while getting\nsome exposure to Ruby and Golang along the way, I’ve been pretty much involved\nin JS projects the entire time.\nFor the most part, I’ve always worked in smaller companies, although most have\nhad business/involvement with some more well-known international brands. Its\nbeen pretty amazing to know that some of what I’ve been involved with is being\nused/promoted by some larger companies and, in some cases, had a direct impact\non them. I’ve picked up some great insight into multiple industries along the\nway, from project management, IT security, mining, gambling/entertainment,\ninfrastructure management spaces, and now in the blockchain space.\n…and here we are today :)\n\nHow did you get to join Particl?\n> My brother-in-law knows Ryno, and he mentioned that he was involved with a\nnumber of projects, and that I could always apply and try to find work there if\nI wanted. I didn’t really give it much thought until Ryno got in touch with me.\nWe chatted, I had an interview and then got an offer :) In all honesty, I almost\nnever accepted, but then saw the error of my ways and quickly changed my answer!\nWhat makes you the most excited about Particl?\n> The privacy aspect is definitely a very strong contender, and I think having a\nfocus on privacy is a great baseline. We also have a great team that is skilled\nin bringing the current vision to life. So, generally, I think there is are some\nexciting times ahead already.However, in my opinion, the future potential use\ncases for Particl is what I’m most excited about. I personally see a couple of\napplications for it in the future, and it’s going to be exciting to see what\nsuggestions and integrations come through.\n\nObligatory question: Where does your ZaSmilingIdiot Github username come from?\n> Its actually a name I’ve used in gaming circles: I don’t play too much but when\nI do I’m purely in it for the fun of it. So it’s more about laughing at my own\n(usual) noobiness. Its also probably closer to being the antithesis of how I\nfeel I really am… so there’s that as well! But mostly, it’s about just having\nfun and not caring what others think of me.\nWhat is the biggest challenge you foresee with Particl?\n> I see two (my own, very likely uninformed, opinions).Firstly, in the general\ncrypto space, on-boarding users to make use of the various applications and\nproducts is the one I’m most concerned about at the moment. In terms of Particl\nand the marketplace, this translates to the idea that the average user wanting\nto purchase something online can quickly and conveniently sign in/up to a\nregular online store, and complete a purchase in a few minutes using the fiat\ncurrency already available to them. On the crypto side of the fence, unless the\nuser is already holding a certain amount of the coin of choice and has the app\nalready synced, it requires that the user follow a more complicated process.\nThis means the average mainstream buyer is likely to, at least at first, stick\nwith their current online store purchases due to convenience and ease of\ncompleting the process. A lack of buyers is also not encouraging for sellers to\nuse the platform, and so slow uptake from both sides from more mainstream users\nis likely going to slow the adoption speed.

Built With Privacy in Mind from the Ground Up!\nUnlike all of its competition, Particl is built from the ground up to be\nentirely private/anonymous, following the true crypto roots. To accomplish this\ndifficult prowess, it uses several methods to keep its users within an optimal\nprivacy environment, such as the RingCT and CT privacy protocols, metadata\nstripping, IP address anonymization through Tor (and many more protocols in the\nfuture, including Dandelion++ [https://particl.community/t/what-is-dandelion/78]\n), private escrow system with no intermediate, encrypted and private messaging\n(using SMSG\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/smsg.html] and\neventually more scalable and leading-edge DSNs\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/overview.html] \nsuch as Loopix\n[https://particl.community/t/the-loopix-anonymity-system-a-new-potential-dsn-for-particl/181]\n, IPFS [https://ipfs.io/], and etc), and much more. With all the data leaks and\nhacks, privacy is becoming more and more mainstream\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f] \n(link to case for privacy)\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f].\n\nFurthermore, we all see that the government and big companies have developed\nvery effective blockchain tracking software that makes tracking public\ncryptocurrency transactions quite trivial\n[https://bitcoinist.com/yes-your-bitcoin-transactions-can-be-tracked-and-here-are-the-companies-that-are-doing-it/]\n. Indeed, it may be just as bad in terms of privacy to use a public blockchain\nthan say, a bank or payment processor. This is why having a product built with\nprivacy in mind right from the start (vs patching privacy into a non-private\nblockchain) is extremely important. Every day, the “if you have nothing to hide,\nyou don’t really need privacy” kind of thinking is becoming obsolete as people\nrealize just how much privacy is important even for “good behaving” people.\nPlus, there is definitely some kind of people that do require a more private\nenvironment, which they’ll want to use a solution that’s been designed with this\nas a prime aspect.\n\nBut why does that even matter?\nAs broken down in an earlier article of mine\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f],\nprivacy is becoming a hot subject in the mainstream world. Gone are the days\nwhere privacy was associated to people who had “things to hide”.\n\n> In light of the recent and now too regular cyber attacks on tech giants like \nEquifax\n[https://www.business2community.com/cybersecurity/a-year-after-the-equifax-data-breach-what-if-nothing-changes-02062051]\n, Facebook\n[http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/facebook-data-sharing-privacy-mobile-companies-mark-zuckerberg-cambridge-analytica-5208703/]\n, Deloitte [http://fortune.com/2017/09/25/deloitte-hack/], Yahoo\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ireland-dataprotection-yahoo/yahoos-eu-regulator-orders-privacy-changes-over-data-breach-idUSKCN1J32JX]\n, FedEx\n[https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3026819/thousands-of-fedex-customers-private-information-exposed-in-legacy-server-data-breach]\n, Uber [http://fortune.com/2018/04/12/uber-data-breach-security/], Under Armour\n[https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/another-fitness-app-exposes-users-data-a-11055] \nor even Pizza Hut\n[http://www.information-age.com/pizza-hut-suffers-data-breach-123469137/], the\npoor communication and, even in some cases, cover-up of the unfortunate facts,\nthe public confidence towards the tech industry has been severely eroded within\nthe last couple of years.\nThe Case for Privacy in the Tech Industry\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f]\nNowadays, the tech industry has its users seeking for solutions they can trust\nwith their personal data. In light of…particl.news\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f]\n\nBreaches of personal data are becoming far too common, and a good solution to\nfight this issue is to stop sharing your data with big companies that do not\nrespect your private life. However, opting for blockchains instead can be just\nas bad, if not worse, than relying on trusting a big corporation. Why you ask?\nBecause blockchains are usually open for all to see by default. Indeed,\ntransactions on public blockchains are getting easier to track by the day, and\nfor vendors and buyers alike, this isn’t good. Buyers obviously don’t want\neveryone to know what they’re buying and just how many coins they hold,\ninformation that could be obtained simply by analyzing a decentralized\nmarketplace based on a public blockchain. Vendors, on the other hand, do not\nwant anyone to analyze their sales data, statistics, and revenues.\n\nParticl is built as a private-by-default marketplace, meaning that users do not\nneed to go through several steps to protect their personal data. Everything\nhappens automatically, under the hood, and as smoothly as you would expect from\na public blockchain.\n\nBuilt as a 100% Decentralized & Trustless Solution\nAnother advantage is that the Particl Marketplace is designed as a 100%\ndecentralized and trustless solution, which most of its competitors aren’t. Just\nas an example, Syscoin’s Blockmarket interface is closed-source and moderated by\nSyscoin staff. Escrows on Syscoin are arbitrated, meaning there needs to be\nsomeone acting as escrow agent in case a deal turns sour. This can quickly lead\nto bias, collusion, or other similar types of issue born from the simple fact\nthat a third-party basically has full power over the settlement of a dispute.\nTalking to various vendors, this quickly becomes an issue for vendors on eBay,\nfor example, because eBay/Paypal will most of the time side with the buyer, even\nwhen it shouldn’t.\n\nOn Particl Marketplace, there is literally no counter-party at play. The escrow\nis based on smart-contract functionalities and uses the MAD game-theory to keep\nboth parties honest, no moderator required to settle disputes. The marketplace\nitself will be entirely governed by the community, making sure no person or\ngroup of person is held liable for the content published on it or collude with\neither vendors or buyers. This is much closer, in my personal opinion, to the\noriginal, crypto-anarchist vision and reason of why Bitcoin was created in the\nfirst place.\n\nFun fact, did you know that Satoshi Nakamoto had started working on a 100%\ntrustless and decentralized marketplace and that there was even some code about\nit in some Bitcoin’s repository?\n\nMuch Better & Intuitive User Interface\nParticl has a beautiful UI/UX that is built with accessibility and ease-of-use\nin mind. This top of the line wallet looks modern, slick, and is very easy to\nunderstand as well as being very smooth and responsive. The same can’t be said\nof most wallets in the crypto sphere, most of them being far too geeky or\nbarebone to be used by mainstream, non-crypto users.\n\nAdditionally, Particl plans on developing a web & mobile interface at some point\nin the future, which they already have a good idea of how they would go about\nit. In order to break into the mainstream, the marketplace will need to be as\neasy to use as any other online eCommerce platform, therefore a web and mobile\ninterface are absolutely required. While this isn’t currently part of the\nroadmap, it certainly is a milestone the team plans on tackling after the\nmainnet release of Particl Marketplace.\n\nParticl Marketplace AlphaDownload Particl Marketplace Alpha here: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.0-market-alpha\n\nMore recent builds are available from time to time in our #testing channel: \nhttps://discord.gg/Xf8Yyc\n\nParticl is Much More Than a Decentralized Marketplace\nIn the end, Particl is actually much more than just a marketplace, it is a\nfull-blown privacy-focused dApp platform. Indeed, the team has put in its\nroadmap the release of a developer SDK toolkit which will allow any developer\nout there to easily build their own application on Particl. Whether it be a\nsocial media/Twitter-like application, a decentralized gambling Dapp, or even\nthe addition of a penny auction section to Particl Marketplace, the SDK will\ntruly allow the network to grow into much more than just a decentralized\nmarketplace.\n\nThe goal here is not to directly compete with other smart-contract platforms\nlike Ethereum, it’s more about being a decentralized platform where dApps can\nall be interacted with directly from the wallet in order to create something\nakin to perhaps an operating system. Imagine the wallet (Particl Desktop) as an\nAndroid OS and each Particl dApps as Android applications. The Particl Desktop\nwallet is kind of like the wrapper which contains the dApps that make the\nParticl decentralized economy, and these applications are designed to fit right\ninto it in a very intuitive and user-friendly fashion (in contrast to other Dapp\nplatforms which are generally pretty barebone).\n\nOne of Particl’s goal is to take crypto a step further by not only\ndecentralizing currency but also to decentralize the entire infrastructure\nsurrounding said currency (and that, obviously, includes the eCommerce\ninfrastructure on which the coin can be spent).\n\nTop-Tier Development Team\nThe Particl development team is definitely a top-tier team. They are indeed\nranked 6th in one of the most thorough code quality review (\nhttps://medium.com/darpalrating/darpalrating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-march-2018-3c6b839abdaa\n[https://medium.com/dprating/dprating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-june-2018-who-is-still-coding-in-the-bear-283c89735cbe]\n) that did review up to 200 coins (in comparison, Syscoin is currently ranked\n36th, BitBay is 192nd, Safex is not even active enough to be ranked). The code\nquality review takes a lot of things into account, and disregards community and\nmarketing, solely focusing on the code itself. This is something the Particl\nteam is extremely proud of! Indeed, the Particl team was the first reach\naccomplish many achievements such as true cold staking, hardware cold staking\n(Ledger + cold staking), first blockchain to be natively implemented with\nSegwit, first to implement the RingCT and CT protocols on top of the Bitcoin\ncodebase, and always the first to update it’s codebase (currently on 0.16.0.2\nwith 0.17 ready on testnet) to the latest Bitcoin Core version (after Bitcoin\nitself, of course). They have had a lot of other accomplishments as well, though\nthey were not the first to execute them. It is, overall, a very talented team\nthat is not afraid to push the limit while never sacrificing privacy, security\nand decentralization.\n\nTo see the incredible development work made over time, watch the Github\nvisualization videos included in this blog post: \nhttps://particl.news/particl-development-timeline-video-520d8f9c0513\n\nMany Decentralized Marketplaces Could and Probably Will Co-Exist\nAs we are seeing with privacy coins right now, a lot of them are identical or\nalmost identical, yet each of these coins has their own dedicated community.\nSame thing with eCommerce platforms. We have Amazon, Alibaba, eBay, Etsy, and\netc…all co-existing and making profits within their own community or niche. I\nthink we’ll see the same happen with decentralized marketplaces. Wise vendors\nwon’t limit their business to one platform, as that would end up limiting their\npotential customer base. Instead, I see many decentralized marketplaces all\nco-existing and all sharing a share of the decentralized marketplace industry.\nThis is not a winner take all kind of scenario, as long as a marketplace can\noffer good features, good UI/UX, low or no fees, and of course, products for\nsale AND customers, these platforms stand a chance to survive even though they\nare not alone in this space.\n\nWhat I do find very interesting in Particl compared to other decentralized\nmarketplaces is how its native coin is designed to be scarce and in high demand.\nAs such, even a small volume of marketplace transactions could increase the\nvalue of Particl considerably. That is because:\n\n * Users will generate demand for the coin when making purchases (even if they\n   use another coin)\n * More coins get locked up for a certain period of time in escrow. In reality, \n   up to three times the value of an item can end up locked up in escrow as the\n   buyer needs to pay for the item + make a security deposit while the vendor\n   also has to put a security deposit. Escrow lockups can last from minutes, to\n   hours to days and weeks, depending on the specific context and use-case.\n * A great portion of the coins are locked up in staking (can be transferred out\n   at any time, but while they are staking they are effectively out of\n   circulation) as the passive income gained from the process becomes very\n   interesting when the marketplace gets transactions volume since stakers get\n   100% of the listings fees and other Dapp revenues. Currently, around 36.6% of\n   the entire supply is out of circulation and being staked. Many in the\n   community expects this amount to increase as the marketplace gets traction.\n   Note that there is no minimum amount of PART required for staking, thus\n   anyone can stake and receive rewards. That is even more true with the coming\n   staking pool currently under development that will allow even the smallest of\n   holders to stake their funds and receive smaller but more recurrent rewards.\n * Users are not forced to use PART, they can use their favorite cryptocurrency.\n   Ultimately, non-PART transactions are still settled in PART in the\n   background, generating demand for the coin. Particl indeed aims at attracting\n   other communities to its platform and offer a use-case to any coin. It\n   doesn’t mean its native coin PART cannot be positively impacted from this!\n\nThe four points above are why I believe that, even though many decentralized\nmarketplaces will most probably end up all splitting shares of the same pie,\neven a low volume of transactions on Particl would probably end up naturally\nincrease the price of the coin. No speculation needed when it takes off! This is\none of the biggest reason I got into Particl instead of its competitors (their\ncoins don’t have such good economics, not that I know of at least).\n\nThird-Party Building on the Particl Protocol (Mubiz)\nAnother big thing about Particl too is that Mubiz [https://mubiz.com/], a\ndecentralized marketplace aggregator and web gateway, is actually working on\nimplementing the marketplace. What this means is that Mubiz will render the\nmarketplace available on the web only a few days after its initial release and\nwill offer its customers a whole array of services not readily available on\nParticl Desktop. These services include escrow management on behalf of the user\n(read…no need to deal with the escrow, all in the background and the user\nexperience is no different than eBay), customer support & product returns,\nshipping management (vendors can ship their products to Mubiz), traditional\nmeans of payments (credit/banking cards, eventually Paypal and other fiat\npayment methods), reviews, SEO for listings, and etc.\n\nMubiz currently only operates with OpenBazaar, and Particl will be the second\nmarketplace they’ll be hosting on their platform. They mentioned in an interview\nI conducted with Albin, Mubiz’s Founder, that they had identified issues with\nOpenBazaar (since it’s the first decentralized marketplace ever, it does have\nflaws that can be improved upon) that were not present or that were fixed with\nParticl, hence why they’ve decided to integrate the marketplace into its\nplatform.\n\nInterview with Albin from Mubiz, a Web Interface & Suite of Services Designed\nfor Particl…\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-albin-from-mubiz-a-web-interface-suite-of-services-designed-for-particl-decb9a56ecbe]\nA few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to interview Albin Cauderlier, Founder\nof\nMubiz, a decentralized marketplace…particl.news\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-albin-from-mubiz-a-web-interface-suite-of-services-designed-for-particl-decb9a56ecbe]\n\nMubiz is, in my opinion, going to provide a crucial set of services that will\nmake Particl as easy to use as eBay or Amazon. The only difference? Vendors will\nbe making more money (they will make 100% of the sales proceeds), in turn\nallowing them to lower their prices to score more sales and outplay their\ncompetitors. The end result is more profits for the vendor, more sales, and\ncheaper prices for the customer. Surely this should be an attractive solution\nfor most?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the end, I think the current bear market in the cryptocurrency scene will\nmake people realize the importance of intrinsic value. What if you take\nspeculation out of the equation? Does that make your favorite coin or token\nworthless or not?\n\nThis is what makes me so positive about Particl’s future. Its coin has great\neconomics, the technology is top of the line within the crypto industry, and the\nproject is securely funded for quite some time, with a second funding round that\nshould occur next year. Could Particl end up being in a perfect storm scenario\nat some point in the future?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not intended to be a source of\nadvice or credit analysis with respect to the material presented, and the\ninformation and/or documents contained in this blog post do not constitute\ninvestment advice.

Indeed, the team has put in its roadmap the release of a developer SDK toolkit which will allow any developer out there to easily build their own application on Particl. Whether it be a social media/Twitter-like application, a decentralized gambling Dapp, or even the addition of a penny auction section to Particl Marketplace, the SDK will truly allow the network to grow into much more than just a decentralized marketplace.</p><p>The goal here is not to directly compete with other smart-contract platforms like Ethereum, it’s more about being a decentralized platform where dApps can all be interacted with directly from the wallet in order to create something akin to perhaps an operating system. Imagine the wallet (Particl Desktop) as an Android OS and each Particl dApps as Android applications. The Particl Desktop wallet is kind of like the wrapper which contains the dApps that make the Particl decentralized economy, and these applications are designed to fit right into it in a very intuitive and user-friendly fashion (in contrast to other Dapp platforms which are generally pretty barebone).</p><p>One of Particl’s goal is to take crypto a step further by not only decentralizing currency but also to decentralize the entire infrastructure surrounding said currency (and that, obviously, includes the eCommerce infrastructure on which the coin can be spent).</p><h2 id=\"top-tier-development-team\">Top-Tier Development Team</h2><p>The Particl development team is definitely a top-tier team. They are indeed ranked 6th in one of the most thorough code quality review (<a href=\"https://medium.com/dprating/dprating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-june-2018-who-is-still-coding-in-the-bear-283c89735cbe\"><strong>https://medium.com/darpalrating/darpalrating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-march-2018-3c6b839abdaa</strong></a>) that did review up to 200 coins (in comparison, Syscoin is currently ranked 36th, BitBay is 192nd, Safex is not even active enough to be ranked). The code quality review takes a lot of things into account, and disregards community and marketing, solely focusing on the code itself. This is something the Particl team is extremely proud of! Indeed, the Particl team was the first reach accomplish many achievements such as true cold staking, hardware cold staking (Ledger + cold staking), first blockchain to be natively implemented with Segwit, first to implement the RingCT and CT protocols on top of the Bitcoin codebase, and always the first to update it’s codebase (currently on 0.16.0.2 with 0.17 ready on testnet) to the latest Bitcoin Core version (after Bitcoin itself, of course). They have had a lot of other accomplishments as well, though they were not the first to execute them. It is, overall, a very talented team that is not afraid to push the limit while never sacrificing privacy, security and decentralization.</p><p>To see the incredible development work made over time, watch the Github visualization videos included in this blog post: <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-development-timeline-video-520d8f9c0513\">https://particl.news/particl-development-timeline-video-520d8f9c0513</a></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qfhGfmuLjo8?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id=\"many-decentralized-marketplaces-could-and-probably-will-co-exist\">Many Decentralized Marketplaces Could and Probably Will Co-Exist</h2><p>As we are seeing with privacy coins right now, a lot of them are identical or almost identical, yet each of these coins has their own dedicated community. Same thing with eCommerce platforms. We have Amazon, Alibaba, eBay, Etsy, and etc…all co-existing and making profits within their own community or niche. I think we’ll see the same happen with decentralized marketplaces. Wise vendors won’t limit their business to one platform, as that would end up limiting their potential customer base. Instead, I see many decentralized marketplaces all co-existing and all sharing a share of the decentralized marketplace industry. This is not a winner take all kind of scenario, as long as a marketplace can offer good features, good UI/UX, low or no fees, and of course, products for sale AND customers, these platforms stand a chance to survive even though they are not alone in this space.</p><p>What I do find very interesting in Particl compared to other decentralized marketplaces is how its native coin is designed to be scarce and in high demand. As such, even a small volume of marketplace transactions could increase the value of Particl considerably. That is because:</p><ul><li>Users will generate demand for the coin when making purchases (even if they use another coin)</li><li>More coins get locked up for a certain period of time in escrow. In reality, <strong>up to three times the value of an item can end up locked up in escrow</strong> as the buyer needs to pay for the item + make a security deposit while the vendor also has to put a security deposit. Escrow lockups can last from minutes, to hours to days and weeks, depending on the specific context and use-case.</li><li>A great portion of the coins are locked up in staking (can be transferred out at any time, but while they are staking they are effectively out of circulation) as the passive income gained from the process becomes very interesting when the marketplace gets transactions volume since stakers get 100% of the listings fees and other Dapp revenues. Currently, around 36.6% of the entire supply is out of circulation and being staked. Many in the community expects this amount to increase as the marketplace gets traction. Note that there is no minimum amount of PART required for staking, thus anyone can stake and receive rewards. That is even more true with the coming staking pool currently under development that will allow even the smallest of holders to stake their funds and receive smaller but more recurrent rewards.</li><li>Users are not forced to use PART, they can use their favorite cryptocurrency. Ultimately, non-PART transactions are still settled in PART in the background, generating demand for the coin. Particl indeed aims at attracting other communities to its platform and offer a use-case to any coin. It doesn’t mean its native coin PART cannot be positively impacted from this!</li></ul><p>The four points above are why I believe that, even though many decentralized marketplaces will most probably end up all splitting shares of the same pie, even a low volume of transactions on Particl would probably end up naturally increase the price of the coin. No speculation needed when it takes off! This is one of the biggest reason I got into Particl instead of its competitors (their coins don’t have such good economics, not that I know of at least).</p><h2 id=\"third-party-building-on-the-particl-protocol-mubiz-\">Third-Party Building on the Particl Protocol (Mubiz)</h2><p>Another big thing about Particl too is that <a href=\"https://mubiz.com/\">Mubiz</a>, a decentralized marketplace aggregator and web gateway, is actually working on implementing the marketplace. What this means is that Mubiz will render the marketplace available on the web only a few days after its initial release and will offer its customers a whole array of services not readily available on Particl Desktop. These services include escrow management on behalf of the user (read…no need to deal with the escrow, all in the background and the user experience is no different than eBay), customer support &amp; product returns, shipping management (vendors can ship their products to Mubiz), traditional means of payments (credit/banking cards, eventually Paypal and other fiat payment methods), reviews, SEO for listings, and etc.</p><p>Mubiz currently only operates with OpenBazaar, and Particl will be the second marketplace they’ll be hosting on their platform. They mentioned in an interview I conducted with Albin, Mubiz’s Founder, that they had identified issues with OpenBazaar (since it’s the first decentralized marketplace ever, it does have flaws that can be improved upon) that were not present or that were fixed with Particl, hence why they’ve decided to integrate the marketplace into its platform.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-albin-from-mubiz-a-web-interface-suite-of-services-designed-for-particl-decb9a56ecbe\"><strong>Interview with Albin from Mubiz, a Web Interface &amp; Suite of Services Designed for Particl…</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-albin-from-mubiz-a-web-interface-suite-of-services-designed-for-particl-decb9a56ecbe\"><em>A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to interview Albin Cauderlier, Founder of Mubiz, a decentralized marketplace…</em>particl.news</a></p><p>Mubiz is, in my opinion, going to provide a crucial set of services that will make Particl as easy to use as eBay or Amazon. The only difference? Vendors will be making more money (they will make 100% of the sales proceeds), in turn allowing them to lower their prices to score more sales and outplay their competitors. The end result is more profits for the vendor, more sales, and cheaper prices for the customer.

Its coin has great economics, the technology is top of the line within the crypto industry, and the project is securely funded for quite some time, with a second funding round that should occur next year.

Built With Privacy in Mind from the Ground Up!</h2><p>Unlike all of its competition, Particl is built from the ground up to be entirely private/anonymous, following the true crypto roots. To accomplish this difficult prowess, it uses several methods to keep its users within an optimal privacy environment, such as the RingCT and CT privacy protocols, metadata stripping, IP address anonymization through Tor (and many more protocols in the future, including <a href=\"https://particl.community/t/what-is-dandelion/78\">Dandelion++</a>), private escrow system with no intermediate, encrypted and private messaging (using <a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/smsg.html\">SMSG</a> and eventually more scalable and leading-edge <a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/overview.html\">DSNs</a> such as <a href=\"https://particl.community/t/the-loopix-anonymity-system-a-new-potential-dsn-for-particl/181\">Loopix</a>, <a href=\"https://ipfs.io/\">IPFS</a>, and etc), and much more. <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f\">With all the data leaks and hacks, privacy is becoming more and more mainstream</a> <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f\">(link to case for privacy)</a>.</p><p>Furthermore, we all see that the government and big companies have developed very effective blockchain tracking software<a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/yes-your-bitcoin-transactions-can-be-tracked-and-here-are-the-companies-that-are-doing-it/\"> that makes tracking public cryptocurrency transactions quite trivial</a>. Indeed, it may be just as bad in terms of privacy to use a public blockchain than say, a bank or payment processor. This is why having a product built with privacy in mind right from the start (vs patching privacy into a non-private blockchain) is extremely important. Every day, the <em>“if</em> <em>you have nothing to hide, you don’t really need privacy”</em> kind of thinking is becoming obsolete as people realize just how much privacy is important even for “good behaving” people. Plus, there is definitely some kind of people that do require a more private environment, which they’ll want to use a solution that’s been designed with this as a prime aspect.</p><h3 id=\"but-why-does-that-even-matter\">But why does that even matter?</h3><p>As broken down <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f\">in an earlier article of mine</a>, privacy is becoming a hot subject in the mainstream world. Gone are the days where privacy was associated to people who had “things to hide”.</p><blockquote><em>In light of the recent and now too regular cyber attacks on tech giants like </em><a href=\"https://www.business2community.com/cybersecurity/a-year-after-the-equifax-data-breach-what-if-nothing-changes-02062051\"><em>Equifax</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/facebook-data-sharing-privacy-mobile-companies-mark-zuckerberg-cambridge-analytica-5208703/\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/09/25/deloitte-hack/\"><em>Deloitte</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ireland-dataprotection-yahoo/yahoos-eu-regulator-orders-privacy-changes-over-data-breach-idUSKCN1J32JX\"><em>Yahoo</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3026819/thousands-of-fedex-customers-private-information-exposed-in-legacy-server-data-breach\"><em>FedEx</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2018/04/12/uber-data-breach-security/\"><em>Uber</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/another-fitness-app-exposes-users-data-a-11055\"><em>Under Armour</em></a><em> or even </em><a href=\"http://www.information-age.com/pizza-hut-suffers-data-breach-123469137/\"><em>Pizza Hut</em></a><em>, the poor communication and, even in some cases, cover-up of the unfortunate facts, the public confidence towards the tech industry has been severely eroded within the last couple of years.</em></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f\"><strong>The Case for Privacy in the Tech Industry</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f\"><em>Nowadays, the tech industry has its users seeking for solutions they can trust with their personal data. In light of…</em>particl.news</a></p><p>Breaches of personal data are becoming far too common, and a good solution to fight this issue is to stop sharing your data with big companies that do not respect your private life. However, opting for blockchains instead can be just as bad, if not worse, than relying on trusting a big corporation. Why you ask? Because blockchains are usually open for all to see by default. Indeed, transactions on public blockchains are getting easier to track by the day, and for vendors and buyers alike, this isn’t good. Buyers obviously don’t want everyone to know what they’re buying and just how many coins they hold, information that could be obtained simply by analyzing a decentralized marketplace based on a public blockchain. Vendors, on the other hand, do not want anyone to analyze their sales data, statistics, and revenues.</p><p>Particl is built as a private-by-default marketplace, meaning that users do not need to go through several steps to protect their personal data. Everything happens automatically, under the hood, and as smoothly as you would expect from a public blockchain.</p><h2 id=\"built-as-a-100-decentralized-trustless-solution\">Built as a 100% Decentralized &#x26; Trustless Solution</h2><p>Another advantage is that the Particl Marketplace is designed as a 100% decentralized and trustless solution, which most of its competitors aren’t. Just as an example, Syscoin’s Blockmarket interface is closed-source and moderated by Syscoin staff. Escrows on Syscoin are arbitrated, meaning there needs to be someone acting as escrow agent in case a deal turns sour. This can quickly lead to bias, collusion, or other similar types of issue born from the simple fact that a third-party basically has full power over the settlement of a dispute. Talking to various vendors, this quickly becomes an issue for vendors on eBay, for example, because eBay/Paypal will most of the time side with the buyer, even when it shouldn’t.</p><p>On Particl Marketplace, there is literally no counter-party at play. The escrow is based on smart-contract functionalities and uses the MAD game-theory to keep both parties honest, no moderator required to settle disputes. The marketplace itself will be entirely governed by the community, making sure no person or group of person is held liable for the content published on it or collude with either vendors or buyers. This is much closer, in my personal opinion, to the original, crypto-anarchist vision and reason of why Bitcoin was created in the first place.</p><p>Fun fact, did you know that Satoshi Nakamoto had started working on a 100% trustless and decentralized marketplace and that there was even some code about it in some Bitcoin’s repository?</p><h2 id=\"much-better-intuitive-user-interface\">Much Better &#x26; Intuitive User Interface</h2><p>Particl has a beautiful UI/UX that is built with accessibility and ease-of-use in mind.

The future of the tech industry lies in its ability to\nbuild trust with its users, but is trust really enough to keep data truly\nprivate?\n\nOne of the likeliest security points of failure for any internet user is with\nwhom they share their data. Internet connections are now much more secure than\nthey ever were, but tech giants somehow always find the way to leak, lose or get\nour data breached. One of the main reason why that is is that they have\nspecifically identified data mining and reselling as one of the most profitable\npractices in the industry and have engaged in aggressive strategies to make\nmoney out of our private life, most of the time in complete disregard of the\nvery people being affected by such actions. In fact, once our private data exit\nthe servers of a company to which we’ve agreed to their privacy policies over to\nanother company which we haven’t agreed to anything, it becomes extremely hard\nto keep track of who’s using our data, with whom they are sharing it and for\nwhat purpose.\n\nWhy Does It Even Matter?\n“(Personal) data is the new oil”. Tech companies have indeed systematically\ncommodified data in order to make millions of dollars off of it but the users\nfrom whom they’re taking it from are very rarely compensated or even notified\nabout it. How can large and very popular tech companies offer their platform for\nfree while staying perfectly sustainable? Is it only through ads? Nothing is\nfree on the internet, companies exist for the sole purpose of making profits and\nhuge websites have huge maintenance costs. When a platform appears as free, it\nis most likely because you are making “personal data payments”.\n\n * “Data is the new oil” — Jonathan Taplin, director emeritus of the USC\n   Annenberg Innovation Lab and the author of Move Fast and Break Things: How\n   Google, Facebook, and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy.\n\nOn one hand, this “data economy” is good for partner companies that can then\nmake their products and platforms arguably better for their users. The ability\nfor them to know who exactly is using their platform allows them to make a much\nmore customized and personal experience. But on the other hand, things can get\nugly quickly.\n\nMaking money off your back\nThe most common and recurring concern from the public when it comes to personal\ndata sharing is the fact that companies are making millions if not billions\nreselling every single detail of our private lives to whoever is willing to pay\nfor it. Very rarely are users, the very people from whom this data is taken\nfrom, compensated or even notified about it. This creates an environment where\nit is quite difficult for the public to trust tech companies as they are mostly\nkept in the dark even though it affects them directly.\n\nNo consent\nAs it becomes very difficult and even unpractical to track and limit what\nhappens to our personal data once we share it with a company that in turn shares\nit with another one, the user loses any power of consent as to how their\npersonal data is used. The best example to illustrate how this can directly\naffect anybody is with the #DeleteFacebook\n[https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23DeleteFacebook] scandal. In that particular\nscenario, Facebook shared, without their users’ consent, personal data to a data\nanalytics company (Cambridge Analytica) that later strategically advised the\nRepublican campaign during the 2016 US Presidential Elections. In other words,\nevery Facebook users, even those who despise the Republican party, helped their\npolitical rival win the elections by providing strategical data to it and did so\nunwillingly and with no consent whatsoever. This is only one example that has\ngone public, but rest assured that this isn’t an isolated case, it is the crude\nreality of the data economy. Your own data can and will be used against you,\nwith or without your consent or knowledge.\n\nIn the wrong hands\nWhen you decide to trust a company with your personal data, you need to not only\ntrust that they will not abuse or misuse it but also that they will keep it\nsecure. As data has become the new oil, it has positioned itself as a very\nvaluable target for hackers all around the world. As evidenced by the\nexponentially rising number of data breaches, hackers have identified personal\ndata as one of the top loot they can get. Whether it be to steal your credit\ncard numbers, identity, email or any other type of private data, criminals\nconstantly try to exploit and breach servers every day. As a general rule of\nthumb, the bigger a tech company becomes, the more data it will have mined from\nits users thus the bigger of a target it becomes. Trusting a company mean that\nyou are trusting their honesty as well as their technical ability to sustain\ncontinuous hack attempts. On a long enough timeline, the risk of your data being\nbreached is quite high, especially as companies will share your data with other\ncompanies.\n\nKeeping your private life private\nOne of the often overlooked arguments against data mining is simply the fact\nthat privacy is, simply put, a human right. People should always have the choice\nto keep their private life private and share their data only if they feel like\nit. With the current trend in tech, finding solutions that provide a quality\nservice without mining your data is proving harder to accomplish.\n\n> “Arguing that you don’t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing\nto hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you\nhave nothing to say.” - Edward Snowden\nThe GDPR, A Step in the Good Direction But Is It Enough?\nA couple of weeks ago, more than two years’ worth of anticipation concluded when\nthe European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) finally came into\neffect. This new EU privacy and personal data protection regulation addresses\nthe sharing of personal data outside the EU and EEA and aims primarily to give\ncontrol to citizens and residents over their personal data within a simplified\nand stricter regulatory framework. In short, the GDPR demands that companies\nclearly notify their users of what data they will collect and what exactly they\nwill do with it. It also commands that they use a more responsible approach as\nto how they share their users’ data and adopt better strategies to keep it\nsecure. While it is refreshing to see such a strong legal stance in favor of the\nprotection of personal data, it is unfortunately not enough.\n\nDo we really have a choice?\nIn the first place, a lot of users don’t really have the choice to accept the\nnew terms and conditions or not. After all, most of the time, rejecting new\nterms and conditions results in a user’s services being denied and canceled. In\nsome cases, users may have to go through the hassle of finding alternative\nservices that will share (or not) their data in a way they deem responsible, an\nundertaking that can prove extremely difficult. It can also mean these users\ncould lose accumulated loyalty points, saved data, statistics, progress or even\ncontact with certain people (i.e. Facebook). Some people may even be forced to\naccept terms and conditions because they absolutely need to use a specific piece\nof software for work. As the vast majority of the popular internet services are\nnow owned by a handful of tech companies (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft or\nApple) that aggressively acquire any new emerging platform, opting out of their\nwide range of services because of how they treat our data can prove to be a\nrather difficult task which can also lead to a considerably inferior\nuser-experience. After it is all said and done, the great majority of people\nwill accept any new terms and conditions and forfeit their personal information\nto the data economy because of the lack of alternatives.\n\nYou still need to trust them!\nSecondly, the GDPR doesn’t tackle the issue related to trust, misbehavior or\nincompetence. While companies can be sued and forced to pay a big fee should\nthey misuse personal data, it doesn’t offer a complete guarantee that it will\nnever happen, as was evidenced by the #DeleteFacebook\n[https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23DeleteFacebook] scandal in which Facebook\nseemed to go against its own privacy policy in order to sell users’ personal\ndata. The GDPR also doesn’t fully guarantee users that companies will not get\nhacked anymore. Trusting an entity with your personal data goes far beyond their\nterms and conditions and into their ability to secure said data. In fact, data\ntheft has become one of the most lucrative forms of cybercrime and no amount of\nregulation will stop criminals from relentlessly trying (and in many cases,\nsucceed) to get your data. Criminals do not follow the law.\n\nThe Need To Do Away With Trusting Strangers\nIn the tech industry just like in life, every new problem presents an\nopportunity waiting to be taken. Digital privacy and data security have only\nvery recently started to become a mainstream discussion topic, thus new\ntechnologies and practices are set to gain grounds. As pointed in the previous\nsection, the main problem with tech companies has all to do with trust. Will the\ncompany behave honestly? Will it really be able to secure and protect your\npersonal data against attacks? Could there be a way to completely eliminate the\nneed to trust a third-party? There actually is!\n\nBlockchain technology allows two or more users to directly exchange data without\nthe use of any third-party to facilitate the data transaction. Its most popular\nuse-case today is to be used as the foundation for cryptocurrencies such as\nBitcoin and Ethereum where that exchangeable data has a monetary value attached\nto it. These cryptocurrencies allow people to directly transfer money to anyone\nin the world and do so without the need for a third-party such as a bank, a\npayment processor or a company.\n\nHowever, this groundbreaking technology can be used to do much more than virtual\ncurrencies. As it allows users to send almost any kind of data, it can indeed be\nused to build entire applications on the blockchain, usually called\ndecentralized applications (dApps), on which users can directly interact with\neach other without any third-party or company running the software. It is\npossible, for example, to build a decentralized marketplace where users could\nbuy, sell or trade between each other without requiring to trust a big company\nlike Amazon, eBay or Alibaba with their personal data. Think P2P torrents, but\ntaken a step further.\n\nIs Blockchain Technology Really Better at Keeping Your Private Data Private?\nYes and no. Blockchain technology is great for connecting people around the\nworld in an almost unlimited number of use-cases, but there definitely is some\ndrawback when it comes to personal data protection. In fact, blockchains are \npublic and permanent data ledgers, meaning that data stored on them will forever\nbe publicly visible. One of the biggest misconceptions about blockchain\ntechnology, in general, is the fact that it is perceived as anonymous when it is\nnot. Most blockchains are pseudonymous rather than anonymous, meaning that while\ntransactions are not linked to a clear identity (they are instead linked to\ncryptographic “pseudonyms”), they can be tracked with relative easiness and user\nidentities can be revealed.\n\nThe case that private data may be safer on some company server rather than being\nstored on a public blockchain could certainly be debated. After all, blockchain\nanalysis and tracking is already becoming easy as cake as major companies and\ngovernmental agencies have invested millions in companies that are working on\ntracking crypto transactions such as the partnership between the United State’s\nDepartment of Homeland Security and Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defense\n(military) contractor, in as early as 2016\n(https://www.coindesk.com/us-government-lockheed-martin-bitcoin-analysis-tool/).\nThis, coupled with the fact that any data stored on a blockchain is publicly\nvisible until the end of times, makes it extremely likely that all public\ntransactions will one day be fully tracked back in their entirety by future or\npresent analysis technologies analyzing past data in retrospect. Do we really\nwant our data out in the open and waiting to be revealed to the literally anyone\ninterested in it? Once blockchain analysis technologies and services become\npowerful and accessible enough, it will be considerably easier to obtain\nsomeone’s private data stored on the blockchain than it will be to breach a tech\ngiant like Amazon.\n\nTaking Blockchain Technologies to the Next Level\nThe blockchain technology is definitely a breakthrough in how users can directly\nshare data between each other, but as stated above, they are not the ideal in\nterms of personal data protection. What if this technology could be improved and\nmade private-by-design, and what if its privacy could be dramatically improved\nif combined with other decentralized P2P technologies?\n\nPrivacy-focused blockchains are good…\nThe first step for a more private solution is to make data transfers\nuntraceable. The biggest drawback with regular blockchains is that data\ntransactions are publicly auditable. Fortunately, there are some new and\ngroundbreaking developments happening in blockchain technology today where\ntransactions can be made untraceable by hiding transactions amounts,\nparticipants, or both. The main two such technologies are RingCT and\nzero-knowledge proofs, both attacking this privacy issue from different angles.\nNote that “transactions”, as referred here, not only relates to currency\ntransactions but any type of data transaction made on a blockchain.\n\nPrivate-by-design blockchains are even better!\nTo be as effective as they can possibly be, private transactions should be\nmandatory. For example, a decentralized application (i.e. a marketplace) with an\nopt-in privacy protocol is much less effective than if it was mandatory. Having\nopt-in privacy dramatically reduces the number of private transactions made,\nthus making them theoretically easier to track and even potentially more\nsuspect.\n\nNot everything needs to be stored on-chain\nBlockchain technology is a great way to transact data, but another thing it’s\nnot ideal for is to store large pieces of data (i.e. pictures, videos, sound\nfiles, etc). As mentioned above, everything stored on a blockchain is stored in\nthere permanently. Anyone looking to run a node then needs to download the\nentire ledger in order to be able to use it, thus making on-chain data storage\nboth a scaling and security nightmare.\n\nIt is possible for blockchain networks to run alongside other P2P networks that\nuse the same nodes. These native P2P networks can then be connected to their\naccompanying blockchain and used for data storage. What’s even better is that\nthese P2P aren’t blockchains, meaning they can have different properties not\nentirely possible with blockchains such as amnesia. Taking again the example of\na decentralized and trust-less marketplace, a relatively separate decentralized\nstorage network could run on the same nodes where its blockchain is hosted. It\ncould then be used to store listing pictures, videos or even digital items and\nbe configured in a way that it permanently forgets/delete data after\npre-determined conditions (time, context, user-triggered, etc), hence the\n“amnesic” properties.\n\nIt’s not only about transactions and uploaded data!\nAnother security and privacy aspect that cannot be overlooked when it comes to\nprotecting your personal data and privacy is your network connection. In fact,\nmost blockchains allow their users to connect to them through a Tor routed\nconnection. This effectively makes users’ IP addresses hidden to other peers,\nmaking it almost impossible to identify users based on their connection\ninformation.\n\nAgain, as with private blockchain transactions, this IP address anonymizing\nbecomes all the more effective when it’s enabled by design. In fact, if only a\nsmall portion of users obfuscate their IP addresses, they may end up looking\nsuspicious or deemed to be “of interest” by various parties. “Together we’re\nstronger”!\n\nThe Particl Project Is Making That Vision a Reality\nWith the mission to give users willing to protect their personal data a viable\noption, Particl is building a private-by-design decentralized application\nplatform where dApps can be built and used with optimal security and privacy\nparameters. It is a blockchain/P2P hybrid network and as technology evolves\nquite rapidly, is designed in such a way that it can work using almost any\ncurrency and integrate any P2P decentralized storage network (such as IPFS,\nBlockstack, etc).\n\nThe project just released the alpha version of their first private-by-design\ndecentralized application, an eBay-like marketplace for products and services,\nand is working on a developer SDK to make building other decentralized\napplications very user-friendly. The project is built on the foundation of\nprivacy and security, and as such is having its breakthrough privacy protocol\n(RingCT on the Bitcoin codebase) reviewed for any flaw by the NJIT Department of\nTechnology.\n\nParticl aims at decentralizing popular web services as well as the\ncryptocurrency ecosystem and making them private-by-default, heralding a new,\nsecure, private and trust-less way for people to use the internet while keeping\ntheir private life provably private.","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Case-for-Privacy-in-the-Tech-Industry/1-kjhAZ5nvH9SnqAZGsTCyrQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Nowadays, the tech industry has its users seeking for solutions they can trust with their personal data.

Its most popular use-case today is to be used as the foundation for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum where that exchangeable data has a monetary value attached to it. These cryptocurrencies allow people to directly transfer money to anyone in the world and do so without the need for a third-party such as a bank, a payment processor or a company.</p><p>However, this groundbreaking technology can be used to do much more than virtual currencies. As it allows users to send almost any kind of data, it can indeed be used to build entire applications on the blockchain, usually called decentralized applications (dApps), on which users can directly interact with each other without any third-party or company running the software. It is possible, for example, to build a decentralized marketplace where users could buy, sell or trade between each other without requiring to trust a big company like Amazon, eBay or Alibaba with their personal data. Think P2P torrents, but taken a step further.</p><h2 id=\"is-blockchain-technology-really-better-at-keeping-your-private-data-private\">Is Blockchain Technology Really Better at Keeping Your Private Data Private?</h2><p>Yes and no. Blockchain technology is great for connecting people around the world in an almost unlimited number of use-cases, but there definitely is some drawback when it comes to personal data protection. In fact, blockchains are <strong>public</strong> and <strong>permanent</strong> data ledgers, meaning that data stored on them will forever be publicly visible. One of the biggest misconceptions about blockchain technology, in general, is the fact that it is perceived as anonymous when it is not. Most blockchains are pseudonymous rather than anonymous, meaning that while transactions are not linked to a clear identity (they are instead linked to cryptographic “pseudonyms”), they can be tracked with relative easiness and user identities can be revealed.</p><p>The case that private data may be safer on some company server rather than being stored on a public blockchain could certainly be debated. After all, blockchain analysis and tracking is already becoming easy as cake as major companies and governmental agencies have invested millions in companies that are working on tracking crypto transactions such as the partnership between the United State’s Department of Homeland Security and Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defense (military) contractor, in as early as 2016 (https://www.coindesk.com/us-government-lockheed-martin-bitcoin-analysis-tool/). This, coupled with the fact that any data stored on a blockchain is publicly visible until the end of times, makes it extremely likely that all public transactions will one day be fully tracked back in their entirety by future or present analysis technologies analyzing past data in retrospect. Do we really want our data out in the open and waiting to be revealed to the literally anyone interested in it? Once blockchain analysis technologies and services become powerful and accessible enough, it will be considerably easier to obtain someone’s private data stored on the blockchain than it will be to breach a tech giant like Amazon.</p><h2 id=\"taking-blockchain-technologies-to-the-next-level\">Taking Blockchain Technologies to the Next Level</h2><p>The blockchain technology is definitely a breakthrough in how users can directly share data between each other, but as stated above, they are not the ideal in terms of personal data protection. What if this technology could be improved and made <strong>private-by-design</strong>, and what if its privacy could be dramatically improved if combined with other decentralized P2P technologies?</p><h3 id=\"privacy-focused-blockchains-are-good-\"><strong>Privacy-focused blockchains are good…</strong></h3><p>The first step for a more private solution is to make data transfers untraceable. The biggest drawback with regular blockchains is that data transactions are publicly auditable. Fortunately, there are some new and groundbreaking developments happening in blockchain technology today where transactions can be made untraceable by hiding transactions amounts, participants, or both. The main two such technologies are RingCT and zero-knowledge proofs, both attacking this privacy issue from different angles. Note that “transactions”, as referred here, not only relates to currency transactions but any type of data transaction made on a blockchain.</p><h3 id=\"private-by-design-blockchains-are-even-better-\"><strong>Private-by-design blockchains are even better!</strong></h3><p>To be as effective as they can possibly be, private transactions should be mandatory. For example, a decentralized application (i.e. a marketplace) with an opt-in privacy protocol is much less effective than if it was mandatory. Having opt-in privacy dramatically reduces the number of private transactions made, thus making them theoretically easier to track and even potentially more suspect.</p><h3 id=\"not-everything-needs-to-be-stored-on-chain\"><strong>Not everything needs to be stored on-chain</strong></h3><p>Blockchain technology is a great way to transact data, but another thing it’s not ideal for is to store large pieces of data (i.e. pictures, videos, sound files, etc). As mentioned above, everything stored on a blockchain is stored in there permanently. Anyone looking to run a node then needs to download the entire ledger in order to be able to use it, thus making on-chain data storage both a scaling and security nightmare.</p><p>It is possible for blockchain networks to run alongside other P2P networks that use the same nodes. These native P2P networks can then be connected to their accompanying blockchain and used for data storage. What’s even better is that these P2P aren’t blockchains, meaning they can have different properties not entirely possible with blockchains such as amnesia. Taking again the example of a decentralized and trust-less marketplace, a relatively separate decentralized storage network could run on the same nodes where its blockchain is hosted. It could then be used to store listing pictures, videos or even digital items and be configured in a way that it permanently forgets/delete data after pre-determined conditions (time, context, user-triggered, etc), hence the “amnesic” properties.</p><h3 id=\"it-s-not-only-about-transactions-and-uploaded-data-\"><strong>It’s not only about transactions and uploaded data!</strong></h3><p>Another security and privacy aspect that cannot be overlooked when it comes to protecting your personal data and privacy is your network connection. In fact, most blockchains allow their users to connect to them through a Tor routed connection. This effectively makes users’ IP addresses hidden to other peers, making it almost impossible to identify users based on their connection information.</p><p>Again, as with private blockchain transactions, this IP address anonymizing becomes all the more effective when it’s enabled by design. In fact, if only a small portion of users obfuscate their IP addresses, they may end up looking suspicious or deemed to be “of interest” by various parties. “Together we’re stronger”!</p><h2 id=\"the-particl-project-is-making-that-vision-a-reality\">The Particl Project Is Making That Vision a Reality</h2><p>With the mission to give users willing to protect their personal data a viable option, Particl is building a private-by-design decentralized application platform where dApps can be built and used with optimal security and privacy parameters. It is a blockchain/P2P hybrid network and as technology evolves quite rapidly, is designed in such a way that it can work using almost any currency and integrate any P2P decentralized storage network (such as IPFS, Blockstack, etc).</p><p>The project just released the alpha version of their first private-by-design decentralized application, an eBay-like marketplace for products and services, and is working on a developer SDK to make building other decentralized applications very user-friendly.

The future of the tech industry lies in its ability to build trust with its users, but is trust really enough to keep data truly private?</p><p>One of the likeliest security points of failure for any internet user is with whom they share their data. Internet connections are now much more secure than they ever were, but tech giants somehow always find the way to leak, lose or get our data breached. One of the main reason why that is is that they have specifically identified data mining and reselling as one of the most profitable practices in the industry and have engaged in aggressive strategies to make money out of our private life, most of the time in complete disregard of the very people being affected by such actions. In fact, once our private data exit the servers of a company to which we’ve agreed to their privacy policies over to another company which we haven’t agreed to anything, it becomes extremely hard to keep track of who’s using our data, with whom they are sharing it and for what purpose.</p><h2 id=\"why-does-it-even-matter\">Why Does It Even Matter?</h2><p>“(Personal) data is the new oil”. Tech companies have indeed systematically commodified data in order to make millions of dollars off of it but the users from whom they’re taking it from are very rarely compensated or even notified about it. How can large and very popular tech companies offer their platform for free while staying perfectly sustainable? Is it only through ads? Nothing is free on the internet, companies exist for the sole purpose of making profits and huge websites have huge maintenance costs. When a platform appears as free, it is most likely because you are making “personal data payments”.</p><ul><li><em>“Data is the new oil” — Jonathan Taplin, director emeritus of the USC Annenberg Innovation Lab and the author of Move Fast and Break Things: How Google, Facebook, and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy.</em></li></ul><p>On one hand, this “data economy” is good for partner companies that can then make their products and platforms arguably better for their users. The ability for them to know who exactly is using their platform allows them to make a much more customized and personal experience. But on the other hand, things can get ugly quickly.</p><h3 id=\"making-money-off-your-back\"><strong>Making money off your back</strong></h3><p>The most common and recurring concern from the public when it comes to personal data sharing is the fact that companies are making millions if not billions reselling every single detail of our private lives to whoever is willing to pay for it. Very rarely are users, the very people from whom this data is taken from, compensated or even notified about it. This creates an environment where it is quite difficult for the public to trust tech companies as they are mostly kept in the dark even though it affects them directly.</p><h3 id=\"no-consent\"><strong>No consent</strong></h3><p>As it becomes very difficult and even unpractical to track and limit what happens to our personal data once we share it with a company that in turn shares it with another one, the user loses any power of consent as to how their personal data is used. The best example to illustrate how this can directly affect anybody is with the <a href=\"https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23DeleteFacebook\">#DeleteFacebook</a> scandal. In that particular scenario, Facebook shared, without their users’ consent, personal data to a data analytics company (Cambridge Analytica) that later strategically advised the Republican campaign during the 2016 US Presidential Elections. In other words, every Facebook users, even those who despise the Republican party, helped their political rival win the elections by providing strategical data to it and did so unwillingly and with no consent whatsoever. This is only one example that has gone public, but rest assured that this isn’t an isolated case, it is the crude reality of the data economy. Your own data can and will be used against you, with or without your consent or knowledge.</p><h3 id=\"in-the-wrong-hands\"><strong>In the wrong hands</strong></h3><p>When you decide to trust a company with your personal data, you need to not only trust that they will not abuse or misuse it but also that they will keep it secure. As data has become the new oil, it has positioned itself as a very valuable target for hackers all around the world. As evidenced by the exponentially rising number of data breaches, hackers have identified personal data as one of the top loot they can get. Whether it be to steal your credit card numbers, identity, email or any other type of private data, criminals constantly try to exploit and breach servers every day. As a general rule of thumb, the bigger a tech company becomes, the more data it will have mined from its users thus the bigger of a target it becomes. Trusting a company mean that you are trusting their honesty as well as their technical ability to sustain continuous hack attempts. On a long enough timeline, the risk of your data being breached is quite high, especially as companies will share your data with other companies.</p><h3 id=\"keeping-your-private-life-private\"><strong>Keeping your private life private</strong></h3><p>One of the often overlooked arguments against data mining is simply the fact that privacy is, simply put, a human right. People should always have the choice to keep their private life private and share their data only if they feel like it. With the current trend in tech, finding solutions that provide a quality service without mining your data is proving harder to accomplish.</p><blockquote>“Arguing that you don’t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.” - Edward Snowden</blockquote><h2 id=\"the-gdpr-a-step-in-the-good-direction-but-is-it-enough\">The GDPR, A Step in the Good Direction But Is It Enough?</h2><p>A couple of weeks ago, more than two years’ worth of anticipation concluded when the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) finally came into effect. This new EU privacy and personal data protection regulation addresses the sharing of personal data outside the EU and EEA and aims primarily to give control to citizens and residents over their personal data within a simplified and stricter regulatory framework. In short, the GDPR demands that companies clearly notify their users of what data they will collect and what exactly they will do with it. It also commands that they use a more responsible approach as to how they share their users’ data and adopt better strategies to keep it secure. While it is refreshing to see such a strong legal stance in favor of the protection of personal data, it is unfortunately not enough.</p><h3 id=\"do-we-really-have-a-choice\"><strong>Do we really have a choice?</strong></h3><p>In the first place, a lot of users don’t really have the choice to accept the new terms and conditions or not. After all, most of the time, rejecting new terms and conditions results in a user’s services being denied and canceled. In some cases, users may have to go through the hassle of finding alternative services that will share (or not) their data in a way they deem responsible, an undertaking that can prove extremely difficult. It can also mean these users could lose accumulated loyalty points, saved data, statistics, progress or even contact with certain people (i.e. Facebook). Some people may even be forced to accept terms and conditions because they absolutely need to use a specific piece of software for work. As the vast majority of the popular internet services are now owned by a handful of tech companies (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft or Apple) that aggressively acquire any new emerging platform, opting out of their wide range of services because of how they treat our data can prove to be a rather difficult task which can also lead to a considerably inferior user-experience. After it is all said and done, the great majority of people will accept any new terms and conditions and forfeit their personal information to the data economy because of the lack of alternatives.</p><h3 id=\"you-still-need-to-trust-them-\"><strong>You still need to trust them!</strong></h3><p>Secondly, the GDPR doesn’t tackle the issue related to trust, misbehavior or incompetence. While companies can be sued and forced to pay a big fee should they misuse personal data, it doesn’t offer a complete guarantee that it will never happen, as was evidenced by the <a href=\"https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23DeleteFacebook\">#DeleteFacebook</a> scandal in which Facebook seemed to go against its own privacy policy in order to sell users’ personal data. The GDPR also doesn’t fully guarantee users that companies will not get hacked anymore. Trusting an entity with your personal data goes far beyond their terms and conditions and into their ability to secure said data. In fact, data theft has become one of the most lucrative forms of cybercrime and no amount of regulation will stop criminals from relentlessly trying (and in many cases, succeed) to get your data. Criminals do not follow the law.</p><h3 id=\"the-need-to-do-away-with-trusting-strangers\">The Need To Do Away With Trusting Strangers</h3><p>In the tech industry just like in life, every new problem presents an opportunity waiting to be taken. Digital privacy and data security have only very recently started to become a mainstream discussion topic, thus new technologies and practices are set to gain grounds. As pointed in the previous section, the main problem with tech companies has all to do with trust. Will the company behave honestly?

Thank you!\n\nHey guys,\n\nI’ve been following an interesting cryptocurrency project for some time and have\nnoticed that very little information was available about it online, so I’ve\ndecided to write a complete in-depth presentation of it. I do believe this\nproject has a lot of potential investment-wise due to its great technology and\nvision, this is why I wanted to share it with you. This article is going to be\nquite lengthy, so buckle up.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat is Particl?\nTo sum it up briefly, Particl is a privacy-focused blockchain/P2P hybrid\necosystem that will host a decentralized and anonymous marketplace as well as an\narray of Dapps using a native cryptocurrency. The first officially supported\nParticl Dapp will be a fully decentralized and anonymous marketplace which\nallows buyers and vendors to securely transact between each other without the\nneed to ever interact with a third-party. It also encompasses a fully anonymous\nmessaging system built similarly to BitMessage. The platform is currency and\nprotocol agnostic (more details on what this means later in the presentation).\n\nNote, however, that these Dapps are not the same kind of Dapps as on Ethereum.\nThey do NOT work using smart contracts but are instead hard-coded into the\nclient. This makes Dapps much more secure and efficient.\n\nWhat’s Its History?\nParticl is the successor of the ShadowProject (https://shadowproject.io/en), a\nprivacy-focused cryptocurrency project started back in August 2014. The team\nbehind this project are known for being innovators in the cryptocurrency scene,\nbeing the first to produce many feats such as an HTML5 wallet, a staking mobile\nwallet with encrypted messaging and transactions, as well as having the first\nring signature and HD wallet implementation on BTC codebase. Their Umbra\ngraphical wallet, built using HTML5, is widely known in the “altcoin” community\nfor being absolutely gorgeous and very user-friendly. It was not so long after\nswitching from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake that this very capable team\nstarted working on a fully anonymous and decentralized marketplace. This has\nlong been seen has the ultimate value proposition of the Shadowcash blockchain.\n\nBack in late December 2016, word spread around the community that the\nShadowProject team had met with major partners in Hong Kong and that big things\nwere coming regarding the way forward. Then, on March 17th, the team announced\nthey were leaving the ShadowProject to start working on a new and more\nprofessional project: Particl. This move was encouraged by the fact that the\nteam wanted to have a more professional branding and were looking for funding so\nthat they could work full-time on it and get it going for good. In fact, they\nhad been told by the Hong Kong partners, as well as many legal and PR firms,\nthat the name “Shadowcash” was deemed too shady, most of them even refusing to\nassociate their name with such a sketchy sounding project. The new vision of the\nproject also required a lot of major code changes to be done to the SDC\nblockchain/client and team structure. It is for all these reasons the SDC team\ndecided to completely sever the link between Shadowcash and Particl and start\nthe new blockchain from scratch, using their final Umbra release as prototype\nfor the new platform.\n\nThe Particl Foundation\nThe Particl Foundation is a registered Swiss legal entity. As the Particl team\nwas looking to raise money to fund the project, they needed to have a legal body\nthat could receive the funds and spend on behalf of the project. It is also\nrequired for most of the logistics of the project (hiring and paying employees,\npaying hosting fees for the website, etc.) as well as interacting with\nthird-parties (partners, exchanges, gateways, legal & PR firm contracts, etc.).\nThere will be many more details to come once the Foundation is officially\nregistered. It is currently awaiting approval by the Swiss government and it is\nthe last step to be up and running.\n\nAs a funding strategy, the Particl team offered SDC holders an opportunity to\nswap their SDCs for PARTs at a 1:1 rate, with the possibility for the holder to\nadd an additional amount of BTC to the swap transaction to get a variable PART\nbonus added to their stash. This extra BTC is what the team collected as funding\nas SDCs sent into swap transactions were not and will never be sold into the\nmarket.\n\nThey have raised 750,000 USD worth of Bitcoin (now worth around 1.4M), and\nreserved for themselves 513,502 PARTs (6% of total supply) from the total\nsupply. Another 996,000 PARTs are reserved for a second funding round once the\nMVP of the market is out and released. The funds they raised will be used for\nsalaries, legal expenses for Swiss Foundation creation, initial business\nconsultation expenses, new team members, professional PR, third-party code\naudits and University grants.\n\nWhile it may have been tempting to raise more money, the reasoning behind this\ncrowdfund structure is actually quite sane. The total amount raised is what the\nteam estimated were necessary to run the project for one full year. It is true\nthat other ICOs are raising tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars, but\nin many cases, the development team simply doesn’t need that much money. It\ncould be argued that as these projects raise tons of money, they lose a certain\nincentive to work hard on their project as they have already cashed out on their\nidea. In more traditional VC environments, you would very rarely (if ever) see\nprojects raise hundreds of millions of dollars with only ideas, vague\nwhitepaper, and no working products. It is also likely that some of these\nprojects will attract the attention of regulatory bodies due to questionable\nfunding methods.\n\nThe Particl team has mimicked the VC way of initially going through a seed round\nbefore going for a larger round of funding. This crowdfund strategy is what was\nadvised by Swiss legal firms which are used to working with blockchain projects.\nAlso, not only does this structure allows for a fair money-raising method, it\nalso incentivizes the Particl team to work hard on their project and deliver a\nworking product that will impress the community. After all, they will want to\nraise as much money as possible in the second round, and with a maximum of\n996,000 PARTs that can be offered, they have all the reasons in the world to\nmake a good product which would bring more value to the Particl coin. When we\nthink about it, this crowdfunds/ICO was pretty fair and exemplary from a legal\nstandpoint.\n\nParticl Features\nQuick video presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRxmGh24ILU\n\nRelease date: July 17th 2017, 13:00 UTC\n[https://particl.news/particl-blockchain-will-launch-monday-july-17th-2017-at-13-00-utc-3348e8958657]\n\nCurrency name: Particl (not to be confused with Particle)\n\nCurrency ticker: PART (not PRT, which is Particle’s ticker)\n\nSupported by: Particl Foundation (Swiss Foundation)\n\nTotal supply: 8,634,140 PARTs\n\nParticl Foundation ownership: 513,502 PARTs (6%)\n\nFirst funding round contributors ownership: 7,124,638 PARTs (82.5%)\n\nFunds time-locked for 2nd funding round: 996,000 (11.5%)\n\nNetwork consensus: Proof-of-stake (PoSv3)\n\nBlock time: 120 sec\n\nBlock size: ~2mb\n\nInflation: 5% year 1, 4% year 2, 3% year 3, 2% year 4+\n\nAvailable on: Windows, OSX, Linux and ARM (Raspberry PI, BeagleBone Black, etc)\n\nBitcoin Codebase\nParticl is a privacy platform using its own native currency, PART. It is built\non top of the latest Bitcoin codebase (0.14.2) on which the dev team added as\nmuch as 100,000 new lines of code (as of the time of this publication) to turn\nit into a completely unique coin filled with a ton of cool features. Bitcoin is\nthe first cryptocurrency to ever exist, it is the coin that everyone knows how\nto work with and also the most battle tested blockchain. For these reasons, it\ncould easily be argued that Bitcoin has the safest codebase on which to build on\ntop of.\n\nSome other features inherited from the current Bitcoin codebase version include\n(but is not limited to) HD wallets, multi-sig addresses (fully integrated into\ngraphical wallet), block pruning (saves quite a lot of disk space after the\nchain is fully synced), fast syncing, easy tor setup, watch-only wallet support,\nlibsecp256k1 signing and signature validation, direct headers announcement,\nnotifications through ZMQ, compact block support and ARM builds. You can read\nthis article to get more information on these features: \nhttps://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-core-0140-released-whats-new/\n\nDual Token System\nWhy should we have to choose between privacy and convenience when we can have\nboth on the same chain? This is the premise behind one of the major changes the\nteam has made to the Bitcoin codebase: a dual token system. Particl uses two\ndifferent tokens that can seamlessly be transferred for one another. One of\nthese is a public token, which carries the same pseudo-anonymity characteristics\nas Bitcoin, while the second one is a completely anonymous and private coin.\nUsers can easily send public coins into private balances, and the wallet\nautomatically converts the public coin into a private coin. The same can be done\nif a user sends a private coin into a public address. Sending a private token to\na private address successfully “mixes” your coins and allows you to maintain\ntop-of-the-line privacy. Note that it will be very easy and effortless to do\nthese conversions within the GUI wallet.\n\nPublic Token\nWhile Particl is mainly a privacy-focused project, the use of a public token\n(default token) is very important in terms of management, integration, and\nsecurity.\nOne of the problems with exclusively anonymous currencies is that it can be hard\nto confirm the authenticity of the block creation process. What if an attacker\nhad the key to generate an infinite amount of coins? What if no one noticed the\nhack until the attacker dumps large orders of fraudulently created coins on the\ntrading market? These are very serious threats that are a reality with some of\nthe 100% private coins. ZK SNARKS, for example, a crypto privacy protocol, also\nhas this “hidden inflation problem”. In fact, the chain is initially generated\nfrom a set of master keys which could theoretically be used to generate an\ninfinite amount of coins at any time without anyone ever noticing. This is why\npeople say this protocol relies on “trusted setups”; you actually need to trust\nthe party who spawned the chain would successfully destroy the master keys.\nThere is, of course, no way to know for sure whether they didn’t keep copies\nsomewhere or that they were not compromised during any step of the process\n(software, hardware, network, OS, BIOS, ME chip exploits). After all,\ncryptocurrencies are now worth a lot and they have become the primary target for\nhackers around the world.\n\nIt is precisely for these reasons that the Particl team opted for a fully\ntransparent coin generation process. Because all newly generated coins are\npublic, a hacker/bug would instantly be detected and measures could be taken to\nfix the problem.\n\nAdditionally, since the public token is built in a very similar way as Bitcoin,\nit is much easier for third-parties such as exchanges, websites, and wallets\n(Jaxx, Exodus, Ledger Wallet, etc.) to integrate. They do not need to go out of\ntheir way and spend many dev hours without knowing if it will be economically\nworth it to integrate that coin. The best example I could find concerning this,\nin particular, is the case of Monero and Jaxx. Jaxx is a well-known\nmulti-cryptocurrency wallet and they tried to integrate Monero earlier this\nyear. After trying to add the coin to their wallet, they announced they would\nfinally not do it because it was too complicated and they didn’t feel the amount\nof dev time required for this project would be worth it. This would not happen\nwith Particl as the BTC codebase is what everybody is used to working with and\ncan integrate it without much effort.\n\nThis public token is also very useful for people who do not necessarily require\na permanently anonymous experience. Fully-anonymous currencies can sometimes\nhinder one’s ability to effectively keep track of financial records and\ntransactions. Some services ask for extra information (i.e. a payment ID for\nMonero) in order for a transaction to be accepted and there are many situations\nwhere one could forget to note that transaction ID down or lose it afterward.\nThere’s also a lot of scenarios where one would need to go back several months\ninto the past to see specific transaction details. In most cases, it is simply\nharder to keep track of things with fully private coins so having one that does\npossess great accountability tools is definitively a plus.\n\nOn top of this, a transaction using any privacy coin is generally going to cost\nmore in fees than a public transaction on a non-bloated BTC codebase currency as\nit typically involves more data movement and computation. A “public user”, one\nthat does not necessarily want to be anonymous, should not have to pay for\nprivacy features he does not need. By making the public token the default coin,\nthis ensures that only users seeking privacy options will use the privacy token,\nwhile the public users (which will probably end up being the majority of Particl\nusers if the platform becomes mainstream) default to the public token. This also\nhas the non-negligible effect of putting less stress on the network (as public\ntransactions are more lightweight and do not fill blocks as much as private\nones), keeping the network efficient.\n\nPrivate Token\nParticl’s private token has a variable degree of privacy which can be adjusted\nby users according to their preferences. In fact, when making a private\ntransaction, it is possible to send it using Confidential Transactions or RingCT\n(which is a blend of ring signatures and Confidential Transactions). It is\nnoteworthy to mention that this is the first time both these protocols are being\nimplemented on the Bitcoin codebase. While a few coins use Confidential\nTransactions as their privacy protocol, only one uses an implementation of\nRingCT on their main net: Monero.\n\nConfidential Transactions, or CT, is a privacy protocol initially developed for\nBitcoin that hides amounts sent from the public and makes it visible only to\nparties involved in the actual transaction. While it is very efficient to\nobfuscate most regular person-to-person transactions, its most interesting use\ncase is when used in Particl’s marketplace decentralized escrow system. As a\nmatter of fact, if the market’s escrow system worked using the public token, it\nwould be trivial for determined attackers to detect patterns in the public\nescrow contracts and match them to potential users. On a long enough timeline,\nusers could be identified with particular marketplace orders with a high degree\nof certainty. With the help of Confidential Transactions, this cuts off this\nattack vector and makes the escrow system fully anonymous. To learn more about\nCT, please consult this link: \nhttps://people.xiph.org/~greg/confidential_values.txt\n\nRingCT, on the other side, is an even better privacy protocol combining ring\nsignatures to the aforementioned confidential transaction protocol. Applied on\ndouble stealth addresses, not only transaction amounts are hidden but the sender\nand receiver addresses as well, making RingCT transactions completely\nuntraceable. It should be taken into consideration that RingCT will not be\navailable when Particl first launches, but will it be implemented soon enough.\nThis feature is currently on testnet #3, but it still requires some work before\nit is incorporated into the main chain. The team also wants to have it fully\naudited by a third-party before going live with it.\n\nOne useful feature of the Particl wallet is that users are actually presented\nwith the option to choose the privacy protocol they want to use according to\ntheir needs. CT is a good privacy protocol for basic privacy, but RingCT is even\nbetter as it makes transactions unlinkable. However, the latter is much more\nexpensive in fees than the first one, and people who do not require a “paranoid”\nlevel of privacy may not want to pay larger fees.\n\nIn my subjective opinion, Particl will offer the best privacy experience on the\nmarket as it is very flexible but makes no compromise. RingCT is considered\ntop-of-the-line technology and it simply works fantastically in preserving one’s\nprivacy. Some could argue that ZK-SNARKS offers a better solution, and that is\nrightfully debatable. They do offer an interesting privacy solution, but they do\nhave their share of problems and vulnerabilities as mentioned above. Centralized\ncoin mixers are obviously not to be trusted as there is no way to know the\nlegitimacy of the website owner, and coinjoin services are demonstrably weak and\nexploitable by determined adversaries.\n\nThe hidden inflation problem is also one of the reasons why I believe Particl,\nwith its dual token system, has a “safer” (and easier to integrate)\nimplementation of RingCT than Monero. Don’t get me wrong, there are good\narguments people could make about Monero having the better integration. For\nexample, RingCT being mandatory and by default on all transactions makes it\nimpossible to make a basic human mistake (they do happen), but it also makes\nMonero a more expensive currency to use and a blockchain less likely to be able\nto support a huge influx of users (as transactions are heavy and would bloat the\nblockchain faster). This is the kind of debate where both sides have pros and\ncons, so I will let you make your own conclusion on this topic.\n\nAlso related to Particl’s privacy but not its private coin, it is possible to\nroute the wallet’s connection through TOR in order to keep your node IP address\nprivate. This is absolutely needed if you want a secure staking setup (unless\nyou used OpenVPN with solid network rules) as broadcasting the real IP address\nof a staking node to the world is asking for trouble.\n\nDecentralized & Anonymous Person-to-person Marketplace\nQuoted from Particl’s whitepaper draft\n[https://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf]\n: “Satoshi Nakamoto, the visionary and creator of Bitcoin, originally intended\nthat Bitcoin is paired with a marketplace, as evidenced by beginnings of a\nmarket framework included in early snapshots of the Bitcoin codebase. The\nmarket-related code was eventually stripped out, however, presumably as he\ndecided to focus first on creating his world-changing currency. The concept of a\ndecentralized marketplace in itself is not novel, there have been a small set of\nacademic constructions and even serious attempts at creating them. They either\npropose solutions that scale extremely well and neglect the privacy\nimplications, or they propose very privacy conscious solutions that do not scale\nwell. Privacy and efficiency are often at odds with each other,” to hide the\nsignal there must be noise”. Tor exemplifies this well, the traffic is pushed\nthrough various nodes with several layers of encryption before arriving at its\ndestination, it is deliberately inefficient but the privacy provided by the\ntrade-off is well worth it”.\n\nParticl Marketplace mock up posted during the fundraiser (Confirmed outdated,\nbut gives a rough idea where the team is going visually speaking)In development\nfor about two years, the Particl marketplace strives to be the first \ndecentralized marketplace to successfully nail scalability and full privacy at\nthe same time. The team aspires to achieve this accomplishment by using the OMP\nmarket protocol they developed internally.\n\nOpen Market Protocol\nThe Open Market Protocol, or OMP, is a “standardized and open format that can\nencompass all the economic interactions of an online marketplace” (\nhttps://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/#). The OMP is built with three main\ncomponents in mind, namely extensibility, privacy, and market data portability.\nIt can be adopted by anyone who wishes to build a decentralized market of some\nsort.\n\nIts extensibility characteristic makes it much more resilient to new, more\nefficient technologies to come out. This aspect is explained in details in the\nProtocol-agnosticism section of this presentation.\n\nPrivacy is also an important cornerstone of this protocol. “Recent revelations\nand academic papers have proven beyond a doubt that there are many active\nthreats to our digital privacy and security. Additionally, decentralized\nnetworks, as well as blockchains, are open public books full of sensitive\ninformation for passive attackers to abuse. This was of great concern when\ndesigning [the OMP] protocol as it could potentially put [its] users at risk”\n\nPortability is the ability to easily move market data such as inventory, images\nand shipping details (among others) data between different markets. “One of the\nmany frustrations that online merchants and vendors suffer is the lack of\nportability of the inventory data between the many different online\nmarketplaces. The more markets your products are available on, the greater their\nexposure and thus the greater their potential revenue streams. Yet importing the\ninventory data into another application or website remains a cumbersome process,\noften on purpose to prevent vendors from using competition” By making market\ndata standardized, it becomes very easy for vendors to open a shop on any\nmarketplace using the OMP protocol and realize their full economic potential.\n\nDecentralized & Trust-less Escrow System\nThere are many challenges in designing a fully anonymous and decentralized\nmarketplace. One of these is to ensure that neither the vendors nor the buyers\nget scammed by the other party. How do you make sure the vendor doesn’t simply\ntake the money and not ship the product? How do you make sure the buyer actually\npays for a shipped product? In most cases, typical marketplaces such as Alibaba,\neBay or Amazon use what is called an escrow system. The platform acts as a\nmiddle-man and receives the payment of a product or service on behalf of the\nvendor and holds on to it until the buyer confirms he has received the product.\nShould problems arise, the escrow agent will usually take the role of a mediator\nand decide what happens to the escrowed funds (it will either be a refund for\nthe buyer or a release of funds to the vendor).\n\nSince the Particl marketplace aims to be entirely trustless, it cannot use\nescrow agents as that constitutes centralization. An agent could be wrong on a\ndecision, go rogue, collude with a party, and above all, they always charge a\nfee. No escrow agent will work for free.\n\nThe Particl team developed what they call the MAD escrow system. This trust-less\nand free service is based on the Mutually Assisted Destruction game theory. As\ndefined on Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction],\nMutual assured destruction (or mutual assisted destruction) “is a doctrine of\nmilitary strategy and national security policy in which a full-scale use of\nnuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides would cause the complete\nannihilation of both the attacker and the defender. It is based on the theory of\ndeterrence, which holds that the threat of using strong weapons against the\nenemy prevents the enemy’s use of those same weapons. The strategy is a form of\nNash equilibrium in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to\ninitiate a conflict or to disarm”.\n\nIn the context of an escrow system, it simply means that the escrow is designed\nin such a way that it financially punishes both parties if one of them behaves\nbadly. The MAD escrow works by requiring the buyer to deposit twice the amount\nof the desired product in a 2-of-2 multisig escrow address, while the vendor has\nto deposit the full value of the item he is selling as insurance. Both parties\nneed to sign the release of the funds before a set time for the deal to\nconclude, otherwise, the escrow busts and funds are sent over to the stakers.\n\nFor example, if you were selling a 500$ TV to a user, you would have to fund the\nMAD escrow with 500$ and your buyer would need to fund it with 1,000$ (500$ item\nvalue + 100% insurance deposit of 500$). The document section of the\nshadowproject.io website explains in an understandable fashion how the\npsychology behind MAD escrow works:\n\nFrom ShadowProject’s documentation page\n[https://doc.shadowproject.io/#mutual-assured-destruction-mad]: “If the buyer\nreceives the item and decides not to finalize the transaction then the address\nbecomes unspendable after the expiration date and neither party gets their\ninsurance deposit back. The buyer will have effectively paid twice the price but\nthe vendor loses his insurance deposit and the item. [If] the vendor does not to\nship the item, [it] leaves the buyer with the option to finalize the transaction\nor not: finalizing the transaction causes him to minimalize his losses to one\ntime the price of the item and the vendor makes a profit of one time the item\nprice. If the buyer decides not to finalize the transaction he loses twice the\namount of the item price but also causes the vendor to lose his insurance\ndeposit. The buyer is to some extent at a disadvantage and motivated to finalize\nthe transaction to minimize his losses in case of a vendor scam. Both the buyer\nand the vendor will be motivated to extend the escrow transaction and work\ntowards a refund agreement that both parties are willing to sign.”\n\nOf course, this MAD escrow system is flexible. If a problem arises during a\ntransaction, both parties can agree to either extend the escrow deadline time or\nproceed with partial refunds. It is also entirely up to the users to decide what\ninsurance deposit percentage they want to use. A vendor and a buyer could agree\nfor a 25% insurance deposit, meaning that for a 500$ TV purchase, a vendor would\nneed to deposit 125$ into the escrow while the buyer would need to deposit 625$\n(500$ + 25% insurance deposit of 125$).\n\nSelf-Governance\nAnother of the big challenges in designing a decentralized and anonymous market\nis trying to reduce the irresponsible and criminal use of the platform as much\nas possible. Since it is censorship-resistant, no central authority can delete\nits content and so it could easily be abused by criminals, spammers, and trolls.\nThis would end up making the platform look much less appealing to the regular\nhonest user and enable undesirable activities.\n\nParticl’s solution to this problem is a self-governance system where users can\nflag undesirable content. At this moment, it is not confirmed whether a listing\nconsidered undesirable is completely taken out of the market or if it puts it in\nan NSFW kind of state where users can decide whether they want that type of\ncontent to be displayed or not (similar to how OpenBazaar does it). The method\nof governance is also not confirmed, but if we are to speculate, it could\npossibly be tied to staking like Particl’s voting system works (will be\nexplained later in this document).\n\nPrivate Listings\nAs mentioned just above, there is a self-governance in place preventing the\nplatform from essentially becoming a decentralized version of the infamous\nSilkroad marketplace. There is, however, a form of listing which cannot be\nflagged by the community: private listings. These listings do not appear on the\npublic marketplace and are hidden even from the blockchain itself as they are\nfully encrypted. Only a vendor and a user possessing a specific link to the\nlisting can have access to its content, making it a very interesting use-case\nfor alternative markets as anyone could simply run a website making external\nreferences to these private listings, fundamentally creating the perfect\nsemblance of a 100% anonymous and censorship-proof (even from Particl’s\nself-governance system) marketplace that cannot get hacked, be busted or exit\nscam their users.\n\nFighting Spam\nAs mentioned above, spammers are another major concern on popular blockchain\nplatforms. In the crypto world, there are many reasons why one would want to\nmount a spam attack on a chain. It could be because that entity wants to short\nthe coin on trading markets, or because he has invested in a competing platform\nthat is seeking to destroy the reputation of Particl.\n\nFighting spam attacks will always remain an ongoing battle as spammers will\nalways try to find new ways to make themselves an annoyance, and the Particl\nteam plans on keeping the platform spam-free a priority. On market release, the\nplatform will already be armed with two spam-fighting features other than the\nself-governance flagging system.\n\nThe first one of these measures is to make listings stay up for a maximum of 48\nhours. That means a spammer has to constantly keep the attack up otherwise it\nwill not have any long-term damage to the platform. This also helps the market\nbe much more scalable as it only requires to have two days worth of listings.\nThe second measure is the implementation of a very small listing fee (initially\n0.01 PART, can be adjusted and ultimately made dynamic) making a sustained\nattack quite costly for an attacker. While the fees are quite small, mounting a\nconsiderably effective spam attack would require large amounts of funds to be\npaid to the market every two days.\n\nAs will be explained further down this presentation, market fees actually go to\nthe stakers (people who run nodes that secure the network), which brings an\ninteresting dynamic…Any spammer that wants to heavily spam the Particl\nmarketplace inevitably ends up sending his money to the very community he is\ntrying to bring down!\n\nGoing Mainstream\nThe project doesn’t hide the fact that it wishes to become the first\ndecentralized marketplace to become used in the multi-billion “mainstream” world\nof commerce. This is why user-friendliness and usability are at the core of the\nteam’s strategy. The ultimate goal is to make the cryptocurrency side of things\nall in the background so that even your grandmother could intuitively use it.\n\nAnother mainstream-appealing feature the team is working on is the integration\nof many in-client fiat gateways from which one could fund his Particl wallet.\nSome solutions being explored at the moment would allow users to use bank\ntransfers, credit cards, and Localbitcoin-style services. Note, however, that\nneither the Particl developing team nor the Particl Foundation are licensed\nfinancial organizations, therefore this implementation most certainly would be\nthe result of partnerships with other services (i.e. Changelly, Tether, etc.).\nIt would be very surprising if fiat gateways were part of the initial release of\nthe wallet.\n\nLow Fees\nOne great thing about the Particl marketplace is its relatively low prices\ncompared to centralized competitors. In fact, selling on websites such as Amazon\nor Alibaba is great because they bring vendors a lot of users, but they also\ncharge a huge premium just so their user base can be leveraged. After all, it is\ngenerally Amazon/Alibaba/eBay that brings a company new customers, not the other\nway around, so that premium fee is the price to pay to get new customers from\nthese big e-commerce platforms.\n\nLet’s take Alibaba, for example. It is one of the most valued e-commerce\nwebsites on the internet and has a huge user base of both buyers, merchants,\nservice providers and suppliers. If you wanted to start selling products on it,\nyou would probably want to get a gold membership so you don’t get absolutely\nburied in the thousands of listing and so that you at least have a minimum set\nof features you could use. Their gold membership is subscription based and\naccording to Harry Peterson, a professional in China sourcing and B2B\n(business-to-business) marketing, businesses located in mainland China need to\npay almost up to $5,000 USD a year just to get their membership. Businesses\noutside China mainland have variable subscription fees based on which\njurisdiction they are doing business from, but it is estimated that an average\nsubscription amounts to around $2,999 USD a year (\nhttps://www.quora.com/How-much-does-it-cost-to-sell-on-Alibaba). On the Alibaba\nwebsite itself, subscription fees seem to be even higher, now priced at $5,999\nUSD a year for the full package (\nhttp://seller.alibaba.com/memberships/index.html).\n\nOf course, there are various packages and these fees are somewhat flexible, but\nthat gives you an idea what a gold membership costs if you want to use Alibaba\nas a platform and get the whole set of features that will allow you to leverage\nthe full capacity of what the platform has to offer. Don’t forget that on top of\nthese memberships, Alibaba charges a whopping 5% fee on any transactions done\nthrough its escrow system, as it is centralized and requires staff to manage.\nAll these fees, end up being costly for both buyers and sellers. Remember that\nParticl’s MAD (mutually assisted destruction) escrow system is absolutely free\nof charge as it is entirely decentralized and managed by both the buyer and the\nvendor.\n\nAmazon, on the other hand, chooses a different fee schedule to make its money by\napplying two types of fees. The first one is a generic “per-item” selling fee.\nYou can choose two plans: the individual plan, which charges $0.99 USD per items\nsold, or a professional plan, which is a subscription of $39,99 USD per month (\nhttps://services.amazon.com/selling/pricing.htm).\n\nOn top of that, it also charges what is called a “referral fee” which is a\npercentage of your item’s value that Amazon keeps for itself. This fee ranges\nfrom 6% to an almost insulting 25% depending on the item’s category. Some\nAmazon-branded items can even go up to 45%. Please visit this detailed article\nto know the exact fee schedule Amazon uses: \nhttp://www.cpcstrategy.com/blog/2014/06/sell-on-amazon-pricing/. There is also\nanother type of fee which Amazon can charge, but that only applies if you want\nAmazon to fulfill your order (meaning you send your inventory to Amazon and they\ndo the processing, storage, and shipping for you). These fees are all indicated\nin the CPC strategy article I linked just above.\n\nWhat about eBay? While listing an item isn’t really that expensive, your first\n50 listings of each month being free and the subsequent being $0.30 USD, the\nwebsite still charges you a non-negligible 10% “final value fee” (the final\nvalue is calculated AFTER shipping fees are applied) with a maximum of $750 USD\nper transaction. You can visit this link which details all the listings (plus\nsome advanced feature fees I will not go into): \nhttp://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/fees.html\n\nEtsy? Well, it is admittedly much cheaper, but still considerably more expensive\nthan Particl. They charge $0.20 USD per listing posted and then apply a\n“transaction fee” of 3.5% (which isn’t applied to shipping cost as well if you\nare selling either from the USA or Canada but is applied otherwise). There are\nalso various other fees if you wish to use more advanced features such as Etsy’s\n“Direct Checkout”. For their fee schedule, please visit this link here: \nhttps://www.etsy.com/legal/fees/.\n\nAs it is probably obvious by now, these platforms charge their users HUGE\npremiums, which is kind of understandable since they are critical to the success\nof a good number of these vendors. Particl is going to be a much, much cheaper\noption for vendors, regardless if they are big or small. It will also greatly\nbenefit buyers by basically charging them no fees at all except low\ncryptocurrency transaction fees (listing fees are paid for by vendors). Vendors\nwill only need to pay 0.01 PART per listing renewed every two days. This fee is\nlikely to be made dynamic so that it goes down when PART’s price goes up and\nvice versa.\n\nTarget Users\nGoing for the mainstream world of e-commerce certainly is a huge ambition. It is\ntrue that a decentralized system is likely to be less efficient than its\ncentralized counterparts, but it does also offer services that giants like eBay,\nAmazon or Alibaba simply cannot provide to their customers: privacy and\ncensorship-resistance. So who, exactly, would end up using a potentially less\nefficient but more private platform than well-established e-commerce Goliaths?\n\nDuring the time of the initial funding round, I’ve written a lengthy article\n[https://decentralize.today/who-is-going-to-use-particls-decentralized-anonymous-market-and-why-is-it-so-badly-needed-7eb79cc8b9ad]\ngoing over exactly this question. Here’s a tl;dr list of potential early users:\n\n- Controversial & potentially illegal goods & services\n- Perceived gray area businesses\n- Unfairly blocked businesses\n- People looking for better protection of personal/corporate data & documents\n- Taxation resistance & revolts\n- People from the unbanked world where banks and e-commerce websites are not\npresent\n- Much lower fees than centralized counterparts\n- Any crypto user looking to shop with his favorite coin\n\nThis article only lists what I could think of at the time, but the potential of\na decentralized marketplace and escrow system is huge and there are some\nuse-cases one could not think of until someone actually comes out with it. A\npotential use case not featured in my previous article which became apparent to\nme since is the use of Particl marketplace’s escrow system for OTC exchange of\nunreleased ICO coin accounts (trading coins before their chain is released).\nThis seems to be an increasingly popular practice within the crypto world, with\nmost vendors/buyers doing these trades on Slack/Reddit.\n\nCurrency-Agnosticism\nBy definition, “an agnostic person is one who believes it is impossible to know\nanything about God or about the creation of the universe and refrains from\ncommitment to any religious doctrine”. In our context, the platform is\nconsidered “agnostic” because its developing team does not believe its native\ncoin should be created with a “one coin to rule them all” mentality and thus\nshould have a platform that can work with as many cryptocurrencies as possible.\nAs we do not know what coins will be the most used in 5 years, let alone in a\nmonth, it is safe and forward-thinking to make the platform be ready to work\nwith them at any time.\n\nThis feature will mostly be used for the Particl marketplace Dapp, as it will\nallow people to shop online using their favorite cryptocurrency without ever\nleaving the wallet or having to manually trade their coins prior to purchasing a\nproduct. While it may seem like that would reduce Particl’s potential valuation\nas that would generate less demand for its native coin, it actually does not.\nBecause the market’s decentralized escrow is a 2 of 2 multi-sig CT PART address, \nit requires any non-PART purchases to be traded (automatically done by the\nwallet) for PART to operate. Vendors do not even need to state what coins they\nwant to accept, as they all get paid in PART. They are then free to Shapeshift\nback to any coin they want, again without ever leaving the wallet.\n\nThis currency-agnosticism actually brings a lot of value to the platform’s\nnative coin. For one, any order made on the market, whether it is paid using\nPART, BTC, ETH or any compatible currency, ends up being a buy order for PART.\nThis feature also brings a non-speculative use case for all compatible\ncurrencies, as the holders of those coins can now shop online with them and not\nsimply hold them for speculative reasons. This has the potential to end up\nputting a lot of buy pressure on the PART coin.\n\nShapeshift Integration\nThis ability to seamlessly shop with any coin is powered by Shapeshift. That\nmeans that any coin available on their platform can be used to shop on Particl.\nSome of the use cases I personally find interesting is the use of the DGX token\n(gold-backed cryptocurrency, not yet available on Shapeshift though…) and USDt\n(fiat USD-backed cryptocurrency) to seamlessly shop with coins that are backed\nby real assets. Gold bugs will immediately understand why this is a big deal,\nbut let’s pause for a moment and appreciate what opportunity it presents. When\nwas the last time people could just go out and shop using actual gold coins? The\nway it is designed, the vendor does not even have to “accept” the currency on\nhis store, and you can send tiny fractions of that gold coin (which is obviously\nimpossible with physical bullion). This could become a really big use case for\nParticl if the world economy ends up crashing and people abandon fiat for\nvalue-based assets such as gold. This could even initiate a paradigm shift in\nhow people conduct commerce around the world.\n\nNote, however, that this Shapeshift integration is a temporary solution as the\nteam plans on designing its own fully decentralized and trust-less currency\nexchange system. This is due for much later though, and I believe that for the\ntime being Shapeshift will be more than satisfying as an option.\n\nProtocol-Agnosticism\nIn this context, being protocol agnostic refers to the fact that the Particl\nplatform does not limit itself to one decentralized data storage protocol, but\nrather makes it extensible and easy to integrate various different protocols at\nthe same time, and let the user choose which one he prefers using. As Kewde, a\nParticl developer, elegantly puts it on his Open Market Protocol GitBook: \n“Technology moves at an exponential rate, and the very few protocols that\nsurvive the test of time are all designed with extensibility in mind. A protocol\nlooking to be relevant on a long enough timeline should be both robust and\nflexible enough that it easily allows any developer to securely expand it. The\ndevelopment of decentralized storage networks (DHTs, BitTorrent, IPFS) and\nblockchain solutions is still young, there aren’t any clear “winners” that meet\nall criteria nor may there ever be, thus the protocol must accommodate for it”.\n\nTo illustrate why this is a good concept, let’s say Particl only uses its native\nSMSG protocol to run its marketplace on. That would work fine…until the\nmarketplace gets very popular and cannot scale anymore because there are too\nmany people using it. On a protocol-agnostic platform, it would be very easy to\nsimply add a new, more scalable protocol to support the flock of new users, but\nif it wasn’t designed with extensibility in mind, it would be stuck with a\ntechnology that cannot support its own popularity. In most cases, the platform\nwould either be abandoned by its users, require some kind of fork (which is\nrisky), or the developing team would abandon the project and start a new one\nwith better technology.\n\nIn other words, Particl is designed in such a way that it embraces new protocols\ninstead of being rendered obsolete by them, and it does so without ever\nrequiring a fork of some kind.\n\nDecentralized Network Storage\nDecentralized storage networks, or DSNs, are decentralized extensions “plugged”\ninto the Particl protocol to help it store data in a decentralized and off-chain\nfashion. They are what I referred to as “new protocols” in the last section. The\nuse of DSNs is essential as the Particl platform does not store its marketplace\ndata on the blockchain itself as that would quickly bloat it and make everything\nmuch more inefficient. Here is an excerpt from Particl’s whitepaper draft:\n\n“The Data Storage Network (DSN) is tasked with storing market listings as well\nas messages between sender and receiver and all other accompanying data (such as\nbut not limited to images and videos). Sensu stricto the market listing\nreferences, stored in the blockchain, are also protocol-agnostic, simply meaning\nit can handle different DSN protocols such as BitMessage, IPFS, HTTPS…”\n\nHere is a non-exhaustive list of DSNs that could be integrated into Particl:\n\n- HTTPs (Privacy:- ( — )\n- TOR (Privacy: + + )\n- SMSG (Privacy: + + + )\n- * IPFS (Privacy: + )\n- * Siacoin (Privacy: + )\n- * Storj (Privacy: + )\n- * SafeNetwork (Privacy: + + + )\n\n* This DSN hasn’t been integrated yet or is not production-ready.\n\nAs there isn’t really a “best” solution, the Particl platform lets users choose\nwhich decentralized storage network they want to use. Some DSNs provide great\nanonymity characteristics but don’t scale as well as others (such as is the case\nwith SMSG). Some provide great scaling capabilities but are more expensive to\nuse. There is also the fact that some of these DSNs required a native token\ntransfer (Sia, Storj, SafeNetwork), making the integration trickier (but still\npossible) and possibly less interesting for users. Don’t forget that these DSNs\nwhich use a native token either charge the uploader of content or the downloader\ndepending on what storage network is being used.\n\nWhile DSNs are mostly used by the marketplace application (and the messaging\nsystem in the case of SMSG), the agnostic and extensible design has been\nstandardized by the team so that it can be easily deployed whenever the platform\nneeds to interact with third-party software, once again ensuring that it never\ngets outpaced by new technologies but embraces them instead. It also has the\npotential to add use-cases to other blockchain projects (for example, providing\na complete and decentralized merchant and escrow system to Siacoin).\n\nProof-of-stake Consensus Algorithm\nFrom Wikipedia’s proof-of-stake page\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake], “Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a type\nof algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to achieve\ndistributed consensus. Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) based cryptocurrencies (such\nas bitcoin), where the algorithm rewards participants who solve complicated\ncryptographical puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks\n(i.e. mining), in PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is\nchosen in a deterministic (pseudo-random) way, and the chance that an account is\nchosen depends on its wealth (i.e. the stake)”. Paid at every block, PoS\nbasically financially rewards users for securing the network. It is also much\neasier to start staking than it is to start mining (as you need to buy a lot of\nequipment and do some research to understand how it all works), so it could be\nargued that PoS is a more decentralized and “people-friendly” decentralized\nconsensus algorithm, only requiring users to buy coins, deposit them on their\nwallet and let it open as often as possible.\n\nParticl uses a pretty recent version of PoS named PoSv3, and has a variable\ninflation rate that goes as follow:\n\nYear 1: 5%\nYear 2: 4%\nYear 3: 3%\nYear 4+: 2%\n\nStaking As an Investment\nParticl’s inflation calendar has been designed this way to support the price\nduring the adoption period by making it quite profitable to stake. Once the\nmarketplace application is more popular and as staking rewards reduce over time,\nthe “burden” of price support should organically transfer from speculators to\nmarketplace users.\n\nOne thing that is important to understand about staking rewards is that you are\nguaranteed to get a 5% interest profit in the first year if 100% of the\nnetwork’s coins are staking. Staking becomes increasingly more profitable as\nless and less people stake. This is a direct incentive to get as many nodes\nstaking as possible. However, it is highly unrealistic to think the entire\nnetwork would be staking as evidenced by Shadowcash’s historical statistics; the\npercentage of SDCs staking used to oscillate between 35%-50% of the entire\nnetwork. On Particl, if 50% of the network was to stake their coins, that would\nmean you could expect an estimated 10% yield on your first year (if you let your\nwallet open 24/7).\n\nAnother interesting dynamic resulting from the way PoS was implemented is that\nmarket fees are paid directly to stakers. As explained earlier, the marketplace\nasks for a small 0.01 PART listing fee every 48 hours to fight spam. That means\nthat as the market gets more activity, it becomes even more profitable for\nstakers. If it gets popular enough, it could completely nullify the effect of\nthe decreasing inflation rate on staking rewards and possibly even making them\nbigger in the end. Other fees paid to stakers include regular transaction, CT\nand RingCT fees. Note that as the platform gets more Dapps other than the\nmarketplace, the fees they generate would generally be sent to stakers.\n\nCould there even be more financial incentives to stake? Yes, there is! As\nexplained earlier, MAD escrows have a timer that forces both participating\nparties to release the funds before it runs out. This timer can, of course, be\nextended if both parties agree to, but what if it is not and the escrow runs out\nof time? All the funds are added to the staking rewards, which in some cases\ncould amount to pretty big bonus rewards!\n\nStaking As aParticl Foundation Self-Funding Strategy\nWhen calculating potential staking rewards, it is important to deduct 10% from\nthe final number. Why? The Particl Foundation didn’t want to simply rely on two\nfunding rounds as they have a very long-term vision for the project, so they had\nto find a way to get constant funding. A solution they found was to take 10% of\ndaily staking rewards and use those coins to fund the project (hire devs, launch\nmarketing/PR campaigns, etc.). If you are familiar with the DASH project, they\nwere the first ones to adopt such a strategy and it could be argued that it is\none of the reasons they are doing so well right now.\n\nEconomic Dynamics of Staking\nSince it has been first implemented, proof-of-stake has been observed to propose\na different set of economic dynamics than proof-of-work. The major reason why\nthis is so is that stakers don’t actually need to sell their stakes like miners\nwho need to pay for various expenses (electricity, maintenance, temperature\nmanagement, etc.).\n\nIn fact, if one was to analyze PoS blockchains, he would notice that most\nstaking nodes actually hoard staking rewards rather than cash them out. Since\nthere is no expense tied to staking, it is actually much more beneficial to\nre-invest (stake) your new rewards as that increasingly makes it more profitable\nas time goes by, a concept named compounded interest.\n\n“Compound interest (or compounding interest) is interest calculated on the\ninitial principal and also on the accumulated interest of previous periods of a\ndeposit or loan. Thought to have originated in 17th-century Italy, compound\ninterest can be thought of as “interest on interest,” and will make a sum grow\nat a faster rate than simple interest, which is calculated only on the principal\namount. The rate at which compound interest accrues depends on the frequency of\ncompounding; the higher the number of compounding periods, the greater the\ncompound interest. Thus, the amount of compound interest accrued on $100\ncompounded at 10% annually will be lower than that on $100 compounded at 5%\nsemi-annually over the same time period.” (\nhttp://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp)\n\nFor example, at a 5% reward rate, a staker having 1,000 PARTs would end up the\nyear with 1,050 PARTs. On the second year, his 1,050 PARTs would increase by 4%,\nleaving the staker with 1092 PARTs. Another staker decides to sell his stake as\nhe receives them, so on the first year, he would have made 50 PARTs of profits.\nHowever, because he decided to sell his stakes as he receives them, his second\nyear of staking would only yield him 40 PARTs (1,000 * 0.04). Comparing these\ntwo stakers, the first one made a 92 PARTs profits while the second one made 90\nPARTs. Note, however, that this example has been simplified for the sake of this\npresentation. In reality, staking rewards are paid at every block, not every\nyear, so this “build-up” effect that causes stakers to get more PARTs rewards as\nthey re-invest actually happens more quickly, making it even more profitable\nthan in this example.\n\nI’ve made a simple Calc file that allows you to easily calculate your staking\nrewards depending on the number of market listings, the estimated yearly return\nrate, and your PART balance. It takes compounded interest into consideration.\nPlease follow this link to download and play with it: http://onlyo.co/2uQdLoM\n\nAnother interesting economic dynamic proof-of-stake provides is that it\ngenerates a coin supply shock on trading markets.\n\nThere are two main reasons for this. The first one, as explained above, is that\nstakers demonstrably prefer hoarding over spending their rewards, creating much\nless selling pressure on markets. Generally, this would make the coin’s price\nhigher as the supply is reduced while demand stays unaffected. The second reason\nis directly related to the potential gains a staker can make by simply leaving\nhis computer open. Some people would rather not risk trading their assets, so\ngetting a solid 5–10% investment return under a year can be very appealing,\nmaking the coin more in demand. Taking both these dynamics into consideration,\nit could be said that proof-of-stake increases demand while reducing supply,\nwhich generally makes the coin more valuable.\n\nOne problem with that, though, is that if not enough people want to sell the\ncurrency on the markets (and simply hoard it instead), it can create a kind of\nliquidity crisis where not enough coins are put for sale. This is far from ideal\nfor speculators with large sums of money who wouldn’t want to accumulate coins\non an illiquid market as making a large order could dramatically increase the\ncoin’s price. It is also not a very good marketplace currency as you want to\neasily be able to buy it at a relatively stable price. To understand why simply\nask yourself if it makes sense to have the price increase by 10% just because\nyou made a large PART order to buy a 10,000 USD car on its market. This is not\nsustainable, so what would be the best way to have a healthy and profitable\nbalance between supply and demand?\n\nCurrency-Agnosticism & Proof-of-stake Combo\nI believe Particl already has a working solution implemented to balance its\nstaking dynamics with Shapeshift. Remember how I said the market is\ncurrency-agnostic and uses Shapeshift to seamlessly exchange other coins into\nPARTs? Well, it’s not just the marketplace itself, but the entire Particl\nplatform that is so, making it very easy and tempting to actually diversify your\nportfolio by shape shifting your rewards into other coins. Even though it can be\nhistorically demonstrated that stakers would rather keep their rewards than\nselling them, a proof-of-stake consensus protocol has never been implemented on\na currency-agnostic platform.\n\nEverybody says it: diversification is the key to a profitable and healthy\nportfolio and staying in only one currency is actually pretty risky. What an\neasy Shapeshift withdrawal option provides is the ability to very easily\ndiversify your rewards. That means you could instantly convert PART rewards into\navailable coins, be it BTC, ETH, DGX (100% gold-backed cryptocurrency, likely to\nbe added to Shapeshift soon) or even USDt (USD-backed cryptocurrency). The\nconcept of being able to be rewarded in any currency of your choice is actually\nquite novel and powerful, so it could be reasonably expected that this function\nwill be used a lot.\n\nFor example, I know that I will personally keep around 50% of my own staking\nrewards in PARTs and shapeshift the rest into whatever currency I like at a\ngiven time. I’m surely not the only one who will use the Shapeshift integration\nthis way…This would make the balance between supply and demand more healthy and\nhas the added benefit of making stakers’ portfolios much more secure through\ndiversification. Just pick a couple of coins you like and increase your bags\nevery day!\n\nDecentralized Voting & Chain Governance\nMost cryptocurrencies are designed with full immutability in mind, meaning their\nstate (blockchain data & code) cannot be modified after it is launched (or\nspent, in the case of a transaction). However, recent events in crypto have\nshown us that a fully immutable approach to a blockchain perhaps isn’t optimal.\nIn fact, if you are reading this presentation, chances are that you are aware of\nboth the BTC scalability debate deadlock and the past split of the Ethereum\nchain (ETH & ETC) caused by a contentious hardfork.\n\nIn the first case, Bitcoin requires finding a solution to help it scale better\nin order to allow for more transactions per second. There are two popular\nsolutions to fix scalability, one that requires a change to the coin’s protocol\n(blocksize increase) and one that doesn’t (Segwit implementation). To make\nthings worse, their community is actually split into several groups, mainly the\ncommunity (traders, holders), devs (Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Unlimited) and miners.\nAll these groups have their own motives and interests, and that makes coming to\na middle-ground and making a decision all can agree to extremely hard. Also,\nbecause Segwit only requires miners to signal for it, it could be argued that\nthe actual trading/holding community doesn’t have much weight in this whole\ndebate as they can have only a very minimal impact on the signaling.\n\nIn the second case, Ethereum community was faced with a tough decision last year\nwhen their The DAO smart-contract got hacked and somebody was draining all funds\nfrom it. They had the choice to either let the attacker get away with all the\nfunds, or make a modification to the “The DAO” contract that would have blocked\nthe attack and refunded everyone. The second option, however, required a\nhardfork and it ended up being quite contentious, causing a chain split\n(Ethereum and Ethereum Classic). Furthermore, the polling method the Ethereum\nFoundation chose to use was a bit confusing. They first proposed a “Carbon\nVote”, which was a method they quickly implemented to allow people to vote based\non the number of coins they were holding. After much criticism, notably from the\nmining community, they then opted to adopt a more classic method of polling in\ncrypto which is based on miner’s hashing rate (actually almost identical to how\nBitcoin is polling its community to implement Segwit or not).\n\nWe can easily see the main issues with how both scenarios dealt with/are dealing\nwith critical decisions. First, simply relying on miner signaling probably isn’t\nentirely fair to the rest of the community who doesn’t mine. It is true that\nanyone can use his computer to mine on whatever pool they want based on what\ndecision the pool is taking (what is it signaling for), but not anyone has the\nknowledge or gear to do it, and whether this can rival the mining farm’s massive\nhashing rates is arguable. Also, even though the Ethereum Foundation says it\nalso took the Carbon Vote in consideration when deciding to go for the hardfork,\nthere were a lot of complaints from people saying they actually never heard of\nit. After all, only a very tiny percentage of the network went ahead and voted,\nso perhaps it was too complicated for most people or that the word didn’t spread\nfast and far enough. What makes it worse is that the voting was based on how\nmany coins you were holding, basically making it a 1 coin = 1 vote. While that\nis not a bad thing in itself, it is relatively easy to game for anyone with deep\npockets. An entity with a lot of money could have bought a large sum of coins,\nput them up for voting, and then dumped them once it’s said and done.\n\nSo with these lessons in mind, the Particl team decided to natively implement a\nvoting system on its blockchain that can be used any time a tough decision needs\nto be taken by any party. Note, however, that this voting system isn’t only used\nto upgrade the protocol, it can be used by anybody for any reason. It could even\nbe a vendor using the system to poll his customer base about what product they\nwant to be added to the store, for example. They knew the system had to have a\ncouple of key characteristics to be optimal, namely being as decentralized,\ncheap and limit abuse/fraud as much as possible. So how did they do it?\n\nThe Particl voting system is based on staking and is absolutely free. People\nwanting to vote on a particular matter need to first select their desired voting\noption and then make their wallet enabled for staking (which has the added\nbenefit of further securing the network). Every time they stake a block, that\nwill count as 1 vote. The entity who first sets up the vote parameters needs to\nspecify to the community for how long the voting period will be open, specified\nin terms of block numbers (i.e. for a period of 2,500 blocks). This makes it\nharder to game as a large entity cannot simply buy, vote and dump instantly.\nThey need to hold the coins for X number of blocks and actually secure the\nnetwork doing so. Additionally, not only is it completely free to vote, it\nrewards voters with staking rewards, which definitively is an incentive to vote\non stuff and not just hold the coins and go with the flow. The in-wallet\nintegration (notably using widgets) also makes it very easy and user-friendly to\nparticipate. The only thing that requires a bit of research is that the voting\ncontent (description of the vote, pictures, graphs, etc.) will be done\noff-chain, most likely on Github at the beginning. Once IPFS or similar DSNs are\nimplemented, it would then be trivial to also make the voting content in-wallet.\n\nA CLI example of a user voting for option 2 on Proposal #5 from block 124\nto 2,500A staked block’s vote result (a staker voted for option 1 on proposal 10\nat block #167)Particl wallet showing voting results displayed in a GUI widget\nDecentralized & Anonymous Encrypted Messaging System\n“Communication is an essential component of doing business. Modern technology\ngives us cheap, reliable and effortless methods to communicate with others\nregardless of physical distance. However, this technology does little to\nsafeguard the content of our messages from the scrutiny of interested observers.\nWe live in an age of constant and ubiquitous surveillance, where it becomes more\ndifficult by the day to retain our privacy. Privacy is paramount when conducting\nbusiness, the consequences of invasions of privacy can be devastating to both\nbusinesses and individuals, whether the attacker is a rival firm, a malicious\nindividual or an overbearing government”. (\nhttps://doc.shadowproject.io/#encrypted-messaging)\n\nParticl has its own messaging system, SMSG, used as a DSN to host listings on\nand “to perform communication between merchant and buyer. All nodes\nparticipating in the network store all messages of the past 48 hours, this means\nanyone in the network could have been the sender or receiver. The benefit of the\ndecentralized topology is that there are no direct ties between the messages and\nany IP addresses. Nodes must try to decrypt all incoming messages to check if it\nwas destined for them”.\n\nAs explained in the Particl whitepaper draft, “A message traveling on the\nBitMessage network does not include metadata that can reveal who the receiver or\nsender is. Only the encrypted payload, IV, HMAC and temporary public key are\npublic, the receiver of a message is the only able to decrypt the message and\nonly for them the HMAC will properly verify.” (\nhttps://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf\n)\n\nWhile there is definitely some area of improvements the team is currently\nworking on, notably concerning dual-key stealth addresses, future and forward\nsecrecy, scalability, blockchain key distribution and RMIDs efficiency, this p2p\nmessaging system offers a safe option for people looking to communicate and host\nmarket listings with the highest level of privacy possible.\n\nNative Segwit Implementation\nAnother sweet feature of the Particl blockchain is that it has a native\nimplementation of Segwit, which I believe is a first in crypto. One small\ninconvenience with blockchain projects forking their chain to add Segwit is that\nwitness blocks aren’t compatible with blocks prior to the fork. While this is\nnot a critical problem, it sure makes things smoother and easier to have a fully\ncompatible Segwit implementation.\n\nHaving segregated witness on Particl gives its blockchain a couple of\ninteresting features. Among many of these, some notable ones are the Lightning\nNetwork, transaction malleability vulnerability fixes, and block capacity/size\nincrease.\n\nLightning Network is a payment channel protocol first proposed by Joseph Poon\nand Tadge Dryja and now scheduled for implementation on Bitcoin as well as some\naltcoins. LN gives interesting features to whatever coin decides to implement it\nsuch as reduced transaction fees, increased transaction speed, better privacy,\nand atomic swaps.\n\nAs it is becoming more and more likely as time goes by that the Lightning\nNetwork will be implemented in various different coins, its atomic swap feature\nis getting more relevant. Atomic swapping is the ability of an LN-enabled\nblockchain to be made inter-operable through multi-signature addresses and \ntime-locks with many other LN-enabled blockchains in order to allow trust-less\ncoin exchange between two parties (i.e. Alice can trade 100 LTC to Bob for 1 BTC\nin a 100% decentralized and counterparty-free fashion). This could even be used\nto create decentralized multi-coin payment processors or exchanges, effectively\nspawning a brand new and potentially breakthrough LN-focused ecosystem in which\nParticl could be part of. It also seems plausible that the Particl platform\nwould eventually leverage this feature to allow trust-less currency exchange on\nits marketplace as well as other Dapps, effectively replacing Shapeshift with a\ncheaper and decentralized alternative, even though the team hasn’t made any\nstatement on the matter.\n\nIndustry-leading & User-friendly Graphical Wallet\nAll the aforementioned Particl features wouldn’t be as exciting if they weren’t\nsupported by a user-friendly and eye-appealing wallet. Not everyone wants to use\nterminal-based wallets and even fewer people know how to. Fortunately, the\nParticl team has some of the best graphical designer and UI/UX devs in the\ncrypto scene, as evidenced by their previous work on Shadowcash’s Umbra wallet\nbuilt using HTML5.\n\nGraphical designed of SDC’s Umbra wallet, Particl’s prototype released in 2016\nThis time, the team has taken their GUI work to the next level! Started from\nscratch, the Particl wallet is built using the open-source project Electron (\nhttps://electron.atom.io/) and AngularJS (https://angular.io/) as its main\nframework. The Particl wallet does away with the QtWebKit engine on which is\ncreated all the crypto Qt wallets to make it more secure, beautiful and flexible\n. At this stage of adoption, it is very important for a blockchain project\neyeing the mainstream to have its platform as easy to use as possible. Indeed,\nParticl’s end-game is to make almost everything related to crypto work\nseamlessly in the background while offering users a very intuitive experience\nnot more complicated than using web-based marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay,\netc. A web portal (a website where one could use the Particl marketplace without\neven downloading the wallet and blockchain) is even planned for later, though\nthe team is currently focusing on first releasing the market.\n\nParticl’s “Send” pageSecurity-wise, Electron offers substantial improvements\nover QtWebKit because of how rendered processes are sandboxed leveraging\nChromium’s rendering engine. “A sandbox, in computer security, is a security\nmechanism in which a separate, restricted environment is created and in which\ncertain functions are prohibited” (\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/definition/27682/sandbox-computer-security). In\nParticl’s context, it means that if an attacker was to exploit a vulnerability\nwithin a Chromium rendered process, the damage would severely be limited to this\nvery process and could not spread to other processes due to the engine’s\nsandbox.\n\nOn the aesthetics side, the interface is made much more appealing than the\nfamous Qt engine. Written entirely in HTML, CSS, and Angular, it is much more\ninteractive than any crypto wallet currently released and is designed with a\n“modular” approach to it. Indeed, the wallet supports the use of many widgets\nwhich can be selected by the user depending on what information they want to\nquickly be able to glance at. They display much useful information about the\nwallet in a neat visual fashion, and users can very easily customize how their\nwallet looks by adding/removing whatever widget they want. Elements they can\ndisplay include (but are not limited to) staking data, voting data, transaction\nhistory, marketplace data, network data, etc. As they are basically only visual\nrepresentation of blockchain/p2p data, it is very easy to add more of them. It\nwill be interesting to see what the community comes up with in terms of useful\nwidgets they can code and add to Particl. Also, as the project advances in time\nand new Particl Dapps are created, using widgets will lead to very different and\npersonalized experiences from person to person depending on what is their main\nreason to use the Particl wallet (staking investment, shopping, holding,\ngambling on a Particl Dapp, etc.).\n\nParticl wallet widgets overview & responsive capabilityParticl’s “Receive” page\nParticl’s “Settings” pageFor more screenshots of the Particl wallet, you can\neither visit this link of GUI progress screenshots (http://imgur.com/a/AwNSX,\nposted on May 22nd, so may be outdated) or simply go ahead and participate in\ntestnet #4 which is the first iteration of Particl testnet to include a GUI\nversion.\n\nWallet Installer\nAnother useful feature the GUI wallet will have is an installer that\nautomatically pops up the first time a user launches the wallet and offers to\nset up lots of stuff such as wallet file importation, privacy sliders (a user\ncan choose how much privacy he needs to set up DSNs), tor installation, etc.\nAgain, as the project grows, a lot can be added to the installer to make it even\nmore useful and render the experience as user-friendly and customizable as\npossible.\n\nFuture Features\nEven though Particl will already offer quite an impressive set of features on\nday 1, the team has lots of goodies planned for the future.\n\nOne of them is a mobile wallet with ALL desktop features enabled, including\nmessaging and marketplace shopping. The only aspect the team is not sure about\nintegrating into its mobile wallet is staking since it has a couple of drawbacks\n(potentially high number of unstable nodes due to bad phone reception, battery\ndraining, possible security vulnerabilities, etc.).\n\nFiat gateways are also high on the list of priorities. While a solid crypto\nmarketplace could find its niche within the crypto world, it would be much more\ndifficult to go mainstream if it didn’t support integrated fiat deposits and\nwithdrawals. In a way, this is already covered through the Shapeshift\nintegration using Tether (USDt), but more options are always appreciated. The\nteam is considering partnerships with fiat gateways like Changelly which allows\nthe use of credit cards as a funding method or using exchange API keys to\nintegrate fiat pairs into the wallet.\n\nAnother future feature of the project is to establish web portals on which\npeople can access some (or all) functions included in the desktop wallet. The\nend-game here is to allow people to shop on the marketplace using a website and\nwithout having to download the wallet and the entire blockchain. This would make\nit much easier for regular, non-crypto people to use and is one of the things\nthat could greatly help Particl have a shot at becoming mainstream.\n\nThe team is also looking to integrate more DSNs through partnerships (Siacoin,\nSafeNetwork, IPFS, etc.) and others method of network routing such as i2p. This\nis of course with the goal to provide users with a vast array of choices to suit\ntheir security needs and budget (as DSNs can vary in pricing fees).\n\nCompetition\nWith all that being said, it is now time to look at who are Particl’s\ncompetitors. After all, the crypto world is now an extremely competitive space\nand it could lead to several BETA vs VHS or Blu-ray vs HD DVD situations where\nmany projects would compete in the same sector until one becomes big enough to\nstomp its competitors out of business. Hopefully for Particl, it has one huge\nadvantage in the fact that it actually competes in several sectors, dramatically\nincreasing its exposure and chances of success. Please note that the following\nparagraphs will contain a lot of subjective opinions on why I believe Particl is\na serious competitor in many industries, so take it with a grain of salt and\ncome up with your own conclusions.\n\nAs A Currency\nParticl definitely meets the criteria to be considered a competitor in the\npayment currency sector of crypto. Not only does it possess all the same\nfeatures as Bitcoin and other similar currencies, it literally hosts a\ndecentralized marketplace on its wallet on which its native currency is used to\ntrade goods and services. This is a use-case that very few currencies can claim\nto have, but it doesn’t stop there.\n\nParticl also directly competes in the field of privacy coins where Monero, Zcash\n(and similar ZK SNARKS coins) and DASH are furiously battling. Just as in the\npayment currency sector, Particl doesn’t need to shy away here at all. It does\npossess a similar (and arguably better) implementation of Monero’s privacy tech,\nRingCT, and even adds Lightning Network + CT on top of it for a very impressive\nprivacy combo (RingCT + CT + LN combo). This should be very interesting for a\nlot of people and projects that wanted to easily add a RingCT coin to their\nplatform (i.e. Jaxx wallet).\n\nAs A Marketplace\nAnother obvious crypto sector in which Particl is a serious competitor is with\ndecentralized marketplaces. This space has a limited number of competitors such\nas OpenBazaar, Syscoin and Bitify. Personally, as an investor, my subjective\nopinion is that decentralized marketplaces are going to become a big thing in\nthe years to come. This is why I research these projects a lot, and my\nconclusion is that Particl has the most potential to be adopted as a market\nthrough its user-friendliness and the many features detailed throughout this\npresentation. Its two main competitors, OpenBazaar and Syscoin, do have some\ninteresting features but I believe they will not outperform Particl in terms of\nboth popularity and investment returns.\n\nIn the case of OpenBazaar, it is simply not possible to invest in it and while\nit charges no fee, its user experience is years away from any kind of mass\nadoption and has a p2p approach I am not too fond of. It also offers poor\nprivacy and security parameters and should not be relied on by vendors looking\nfor the ultimate privacy experience. What I find to be the most annoying thing\nabout OB is that a vendor needs to host his shop on a computer/server and leave\nit open all the time. Failing that, the listing is put offline and the vendor\ncannot make any sale. It is possible to host your shop on a third-party server\nto make it more reliable in terms of uptime, but that is taking the control out\nof your hands and a security risk as well as going against the decentralization\nprinciple of the crypto world. OpenBazaar plans to launch a second version of\ntheir marketplace using IPFS which would allegedly eliminate the need to have a\ncomputer open at all time, but that does imply that they will need to introduce\na fee structure to their platform.\n\nWith Syscoin, there are other problems that I see. The first one is that the\nuser-experience is simply horrible and the wallet itself is not eye-appealing at\nall. Their solution for this was to create BlockMarket, a more user-friendly but \nclosed-source interface interacting with the Syscoin blockchain. While it is\ndefinitely better looking than its Syscoin backend, it is still years away from\nany kind of mass adoption and its look would most likely turn off anyone that is\nnot involved in crypto. What worries me the most about Blockmarket, however, is\nthat it is basically a glorified centralized marketplace. In fact, The\nBlockchain Foundry (the company who developed BlockMarket) has total control\nover what content is hosted on its market. It can ban users and delete/censor\nlistings at will, which leads me to wonder why one would even use the platform\nas it actually doesn’t provide much that centralized marketplaces such as Amazon\nand eBay don’t. It also doesn’t provide the set of privacy tools Particl offers,\nmaking it a no-go for any vendor looking for high levels of privacy. Also,\npurely from an investment, I believe Syscoin to not be as worth it as Particl\nbecause people can use other currencies on BlockMarket without having to touch\nSyscoin wat all. This is also the case with Particl, however, the latter\nautomatically converts all other currencies into its native coin (PART) in order\nfor a market order to be possible, so even though a user buys something with\nBitcoin, it ends up being a Particl transaction, generating demand. It also\nshould be noted that Particl is PoS while Syscoin is PoW, and I believe the\nproof-of-stake protocol is more fitted for a marketplace as it allows a lot of\ngreat features such as decentralized market governance and market fee earnings.\nLastly, another problem I see with Syscoin is that should it become very\npopular, it would have some serious troubles with scalability as all market data\nare stored directly on-chain (contrary to Particl which stores data off-chain on\nDSNs).\n\nThough it may seem that I am hating on the other projects, really I am not. I do\nbelieve this kind of industry can and will have enough place for more than one\nmarketplace. After all, we have Etsy, eBay, Amazon, Craigslist and Alibaba all\nco-existing and sharing the same space, but with each one having its niche\nfeatures and appeal to different audiences. There is nothing indicating that\nthis could not be the case in the crypto world as well. Here, Particl definitely\nis the most secure and private solution, and this is what excites me the most as\na privacy enthusiast.\n\nWe should also not forget about centralized, well-established marketplaces such\nas Amazon and eBay. These giants sure do have a huge share of the global market\nand have some really great features decentralized marketplace can probably not\neven dream of offering (at least for now), but they do have negatives that\ndecentralized solutions can do better. Please refer to the previous “Target\nUsers” section of this presentation, or read my previous article on this very\nsubject by following this link: \nhttps://decentralize.today/who-is-going-to-use-particls-decentralized-anonymous-market-and-why-is-it-so-badly-needed-7eb79cc8b9ad\n\nI believe that decentralized marketplaces can compete with centralized ones in\nthese aspects:\n\n- Controversial & potentially illegal goods & services\n- Perceived gray area businesses\n- Unfairly blocked businesses\n- People looking for better protection of personal/corporate data & documents\n- Taxation resistance & revolts\n- People from the unbanked world where banks and e-commerce websites are not\npresent\n- Much lower fees than centralized counterparts\n- Any crypto user looking to shop with his favorite coin\n\nAs A Dapp Platform\nEven though the competition with Dapp platforms such as Ethereum, Stratis, Lisk\nor Tezos in not as direct as Particl competition in the marketplace sector, it\nis still a platform on which more “Dapps” than the marketplace will be built. It\nis very important to understand that we are not talking about smart-contract\nDapps here, but rather hard-coded decentralized applications. To give you an\nidea, a year or so ago, an SDC community member had started working on a dice\nDapp that allowed people to gamble directly on the SDC wallet. The project was\nabandoned and the community member disappeared, but that gives a good idea of\nwhat kind of Dapps Particl could host. The use of DSNs open up a lot of\npossibilities, I wouldn’t be surprised if we ended getting decentralized\nNetflix/Youtube/Music Stores powered by DSNs such as IPFS or Siacoin.\n\nThe main difference with Ethereum in terms of Dapp is that Ethereum is more like\nan operating system similar to Linux where users are given full liberty to code\nany smart-contract with its native programming language (Solidity), whereas\nParticl is more like a WeChat-style application on which apps (not\nsmart-contracts) can be added to. To get a better idea, Paul Schmitzer,\nParticl’s communication manager, floated the idea that Particl could one day\nhave its own “app store” from which users could install whatever decentralized\napplication they want to have on their Particl wallet. It is worth noting that\nParticl Dapps are probably going to be much more scalable than smart-contract\nplatforms as they would work using DSNs (SMSG is not immensely scalable, but\nIPFS, Siacoin or SafeNetwork are).\n\nConclusion & Personal Comments\nFor all the reasons and features mentioned during this presentation, I believe\nParticl is one of the most under-rated and undervalued projects of the crypto\nspace at the moment. Its impressive set of privacy tools, its highly profitable\nstaking reward schedule, and its highly scalable marketplace/Dapp ecosystem\nmakes it extremely likely that Particl will become a popular and widely used\ncrypto-currency in the not-so-distant future. Another thing that I really like\nabout it is that it is building an entire ecosystem rather than being a simple\n“feature coin” (a coin that mostly does ONE thing well). Not only does having a\nworking ecosystem around your coin make it more resilient to being outdated by\nnewer technologies, it also creates a real demand for it rather than just\nderiving its value from trade speculation. This ecosystem is supported by a 5%\n(which will most likely turn into 10%) yearly investment return, on which is\nadded market/Dapps/Txs fees and busted escrow funds.\n\nLet’s crunch some numbers. If one would buy $25,000 worth of PARTs at $25, it\nwould give him a total of 1,000 PARTs. If he were to stake his entire balance,\nhe would be guaranteed 5% yearly, paid every day. The actual more likely number\nwould probably be 8–10%, so let’s round it up to 9%. This staker would make\naround 0.25 PARTs per day (1,000 x 0.09 / 365 = 0.24657), or about $6.16. At the\nend of a full year, considering no PARTs were spent, he would have an estimated\nbalance of around 1090 PARTs, a 9% increase valued at around $2,250 profits. The\nactual formula to estimate staking profits per day is as follow: Balance x\nestimated yearly % returns / 365 x PART price\n\nThat amount, however, is assuming that no transaction happens in the marketplace\nand that no one makes any transaction on the blockchain since no transaction\nfees are added into the formula. To calculate how many additional PARTs one\nwould from the marketplace fees, it is possible to use this formula:\n\n(Estimated number of marketplace listings x 0.01 x 0.5) / 100 x (PART balance x\n100 / Particl total circulating supply)\n\nIf the marketplace was to host 50,000 listings, the staker in the example above\nwould receive an additional 0.3 PART a day, or 11.93 PARTs a year. At $25 per\ncoin, that would earn him additional $298.20 per year for a total of $2,548.20.\n\nAgain, there are some missing numbers that are harder to calculate such as daily\ntransaction fees and busted escrow funds, so it is almost certain that the\nactual staking profits the staker in this example would make in real life would\nbe bigger. It is also not taking into consideration the future Particl Dapps\nthat will end up generating fees as well, making staking rewards even larger. I\nreally do believe these interesting figure could propel Particl into top 10\ncryptocurrencies.\n\nPlease visit this link to download a spreadsheet I’ve made that will help you\ncalculate your staking revenues taking compounding, Particl Foundation donation\nand market fees into consideration: http://onlyo.co/2uQdLoM\n\nThe only major problem I see with the currency itself is that it could\neventually have scalability problems similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum during\npopular ICOs. Yes, the project will soon get Lightning Network once it is ready,\nbut it is likely that it would be mostly useful for micro-transactions rather\nthan ALL types of transactions. Besides, RingCT transactions cannot be processed\nthrough LN and are certainly NOT lightweight in terms of what space they use\nwithin a block. Even though I have heard from one solid and reliable source that\nthe team does have plans and methods they are exploring that could potentially\nmake its currency scalable similar to DASH’s levels, nothing has been publicly\nrevealed (or even hinted at), so it shouldn’t be taken into consideration until\nthis is publicly discussed. However, if Particl should ever have currency\nscalability problems, it would actually be a pretty good problem as that means\nthe platform would already be quite popular and its coin very valuable. Note\nthat there is a distinction to make between currency scalability and market\nscalability, the latter being already successfully dealt with.\n\nAdditional Resources\n * Particl landing page [https://particl.io/]\n * Particl news [https://particl.news/]\n * Particl’s GitHub [https://github.com/particl/]\n * Whitepaper draft\n   [https://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf]\n * Particl Twitter account [https://twitter.com/particlproject]\n * Particl Reddit page [https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/]\n * Slack channel invite [http://slack.particl.io/]\n * Riot channel [https://riot.im/app/#/room/#particl:matrix.org]\n * Latest testnet binaries\n   [https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Particl-Testnet-Getting-Started-d9yhExvCaW6vCp3qLUwuW]\n * Testnet block explorer [http://explorer.testnet.particl.io/insight/]\n * Contact info: hello@particl.io\n\nThis concludes this Particl presentation.

Thank you!</em></p><p>Hey guys,</p><p>I’ve been following an interesting cryptocurrency project for some time and have noticed that very little information was available about it online, so I’ve decided to write a complete in-depth presentation of it. I do believe this project has a lot of potential investment-wise due to its great technology and vision, this is why I wanted to share it with you. This article is going to be quite lengthy, so buckle up.</p><hr><h2 id=\"what-is-particl\">What is Particl?</h2><p>To sum it up briefly, Particl is a privacy-focused blockchain/P2P hybrid ecosystem that will host a decentralized and anonymous marketplace as well as an array of Dapps using a native cryptocurrency. The first officially supported Particl Dapp will be a fully decentralized and anonymous marketplace which allows buyers and vendors to securely transact between each other without the need to ever interact with a third-party. It also encompasses a fully anonymous messaging system built similarly to BitMessage. The platform is currency and protocol agnostic (more details on what this means later in the presentation).</p><p>Note, however, that these Dapps are not the same kind of Dapps as on Ethereum. They do NOT work using smart contracts but are instead hard-coded into the client. This makes Dapps much more secure and efficient.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-its-history\">What’s Its History?</h2><p>Particl is the successor of the ShadowProject (<a href=\"https://shadowproject.io/en\">https://shadowproject.io/en</a>), a privacy-focused cryptocurrency project started back in August 2014. The team behind this project are known for being innovators in the cryptocurrency scene, being the first to produce many feats such as an HTML5 wallet, a staking mobile wallet with encrypted messaging and transactions, as well as having the first ring signature and HD wallet implementation on BTC codebase. Their Umbra graphical wallet, built using HTML5, is widely known in the “altcoin” community for being absolutely gorgeous and very user-friendly. It was not so long after switching from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake that this very capable team started working on a fully anonymous and decentralized marketplace. This has long been seen has the ultimate value proposition of the Shadowcash blockchain.</p><p>Back in late December 2016, word spread around the community that the ShadowProject team had met with major partners in Hong Kong and that big things were coming regarding the way forward. Then, on March 17th, the team announced they were leaving the ShadowProject to start working on a new and more professional project: Particl. This move was encouraged by the fact that the team wanted to have a more professional branding and were looking for funding so that they could work full-time on it and get it going for good. In fact, they had been told by the Hong Kong partners, as well as many legal and PR firms, that the name “Shadowcash” was deemed too shady, most of them even refusing to associate their name with such a sketchy sounding project. The new vision of the project also required a lot of major code changes to be done to the SDC blockchain/client and team structure. It is for all these reasons the SDC team decided to completely sever the link between Shadowcash and Particl and start the new blockchain from scratch, using their final Umbra release as prototype for the new platform.</p><h2 id=\"the-particl-foundation\">The Particl Foundation</h2><p>The Particl Foundation is a registered Swiss legal entity. As the Particl team was looking to raise money to fund the project, they needed to have a legal body that could receive the funds and spend on behalf of the project. It is also required for most of the logistics of the project (hiring and paying employees, paying hosting fees for the website, etc.) as well as interacting with third-parties (partners, exchanges, gateways, legal &amp; PR firm contracts, etc.). There will be many more details to come once the Foundation is officially registered. It is currently awaiting approval by the Swiss government and it is the last step to be up and running.</p><p>As a funding strategy, the Particl team offered SDC holders an opportunity to swap their SDCs for PARTs at a 1:1 rate, with the possibility for the holder to add an additional amount of BTC to the swap transaction to get a variable PART bonus added to their stash. This extra BTC is what the team collected as funding as SDCs sent into swap transactions were not and will never be sold into the market.</p><p>They have raised 750,000 USD worth of Bitcoin (now worth around 1.4M), and reserved for themselves 513,502 PARTs (6% of total supply) from the total supply. Another 996,000 PARTs are reserved for a second funding round once the MVP of the market is out and released. The funds they raised will be used for salaries, legal expenses for Swiss Foundation creation, initial business consultation expenses, new team members, professional PR, third-party code audits and University grants.</p><p>While it may have been tempting to raise more money, the reasoning behind this crowdfund structure is actually quite sane. The total amount raised is what the team estimated were necessary to run the project for one full year. It is true that other ICOs are raising tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars, but in many cases, the development team simply doesn’t need that much money. It could be argued that as these projects raise tons of money, they lose a certain incentive to work hard on their project as they have already cashed out on their idea. In more traditional VC environments, you would very rarely (if ever) see projects raise hundreds of millions of dollars with only ideas, vague whitepaper, and no working products. It is also likely that some of these projects will attract the attention of regulatory bodies due to questionable funding methods.</p><p>The Particl team has mimicked the VC way of initially going through a seed round before going for a larger round of funding. This crowdfund strategy is what was advised by Swiss legal firms which are used to working with blockchain projects. Also, not only does this structure allows for a fair money-raising method, it also incentivizes the Particl team to work hard on their project and deliver a working product that will impress the community. After all, they will want to raise as much money as possible in the second round, and with a maximum of 996,000 PARTs that can be offered, they have all the reasons in the world to make a good product which would bring more value to the Particl coin. When we think about it, this crowdfunds/ICO was pretty fair and exemplary from a legal standpoint.</p><h2 id=\"particl-features\">Particl Features</h2><p><strong>Quick video presentation:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRxmGh24ILU\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRxmGh24ILU</a></p><p><strong>Release date:</strong> <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-blockchain-will-launch-monday-july-17th-2017-at-13-00-utc-3348e8958657\">July 17th 2017, 13:00 UTC</a></p><p><strong>Currency name: </strong>Particl (not to be confused with Particle)</p><p><strong>Currency ticker: </strong>PART (not PRT, which is Particle’s ticker)</p><p><strong>Supported by: </strong>Particl Foundation (Swiss Foundation)</p><p><strong>Total supply:</strong> 8,634,140 PARTs</p><p><strong>Particl Foundation ownership:</strong> 513,502 PARTs (6%)</p><p><strong>First funding round contributors ownership:</strong> 7,124,638 PARTs (82.5%)</p><p><strong>Funds time-locked for 2nd funding round:</strong> 996,000 (11.5%)</p><p><strong>Network consensus:</strong> Proof-of-stake (PoSv3)</p><p><strong>Block time:</strong> 120 sec</p><p><strong>Block size: </strong>~2mb</p><p><strong>Inflation:</strong> 5% year 1, 4% year 2, 3% year 3, 2% year 4+</p><p><strong>Available on: </strong>Windows, OSX, Linux and ARM (Raspberry PI, BeagleBone Black, etc)</p><h2 id=\"bitcoin-codebase\">Bitcoin Codebase</h2><p>Particl is a privacy platform using its own native currency, PART. It is built on top of the latest Bitcoin codebase (0.14.2) on which the dev team <strong>added as much as 100,000 new lines of code</strong> (as of the time of this publication) to turn it into a completely unique coin filled with a ton of cool features. Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency to ever exist, it is the coin that everyone knows how to work with and also the most battle tested blockchain. For these reasons, it could easily be argued that Bitcoin has the safest codebase on which to build on top of.</p><p>Some other features inherited from the current Bitcoin codebase version include (but is not limited to) <strong>HD wallets, multi-sig addresses</strong> (fully integrated into graphical wallet),<strong> block pruning</strong> (saves quite a lot of disk space after the chain is fully synced),<strong> fast syncing, easy tor setup, watch-only wallet support, libsecp256k1 signing and signature validation, direct headers announcement, notifications through ZMQ, compact block support and ARM builds.</strong> You can read this article to get more information on these features: <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-core-0140-released-whats-new/\">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-core-0140-released-whats-new/</a></p><h2 id=\"dual-token-system\">Dual Token System</h2><p>Why should we have to choose between privacy and convenience when we can have both on the same chain? This is the premise behind one of the major changes the team has made to the Bitcoin codebase: a dual token system. Particl uses two different tokens that can seamlessly be transferred for one another. One of these is a public token, which carries the <strong>same pseudo-anonymity characteristics as Bitcoin</strong>, while the second one is a <strong>completely anonymous and private coin</strong>. Users can easily send public coins into private balances, and the wallet automatically converts the public coin into a private coin. The same can be done if a user sends a private coin into a public address. Sending a private token to a private address successfully “mixes” your coins and allows you to maintain top-of-the-line privacy. Note that it will be very easy and effortless to do these conversions within the GUI wallet.</p><h3 id=\"public-token\">Public Token</h3><p>While Particl is mainly a privacy-focused project, the use of a public token (default token) is very important in terms of management, integration, and security. <br>One of the problems with exclusively anonymous currencies is that it can be hard to confirm the authenticity of the block creation process. What if an attacker had the key to generate an infinite amount of coins? What if no one noticed the hack until the attacker dumps large orders of fraudulently created coins on the trading market? These are very serious threats that are a reality with some of the 100% private coins. ZK SNARKS, for example, a crypto privacy protocol, also has this “hidden inflation problem”. In fact, the chain is initially generated from a set of master keys which could theoretically be used to generate an infinite amount of coins at any time without anyone ever noticing. This is why people say this protocol relies on “trusted setups”; you actually need to trust the party who spawned the chain would successfully destroy the master keys. There is, of course, no way to know for sure whether they didn’t keep copies somewhere or that they were not compromised during any step of the process (software, hardware, network, OS, BIOS, ME chip exploits). After all, cryptocurrencies are now worth a lot and they have become the primary target for hackers around the world.</p><p>It is precisely for these reasons that the Particl team opted for a fully transparent coin generation process. Because all newly generated coins are public, a hacker/bug would instantly be detected and measures could be taken to fix the problem.</p><p>Additionally, since the public token is built in a very similar way as Bitcoin, it is much easier for third-parties such as exchanges, websites, and wallets (Jaxx, Exodus, Ledger Wallet, etc.) to integrate. They do not need to go out of their way and spend many dev hours without knowing if it will be economically worth it to integrate that coin. The best example I could find concerning this, in particular, is the case of Monero and Jaxx. Jaxx is a well-known multi-cryptocurrency wallet and they tried to integrate Monero earlier this year. After trying to add the coin to their wallet, they announced they would finally not do it because it was too complicated and they didn’t feel the amount of dev time required for this project would be worth it. This would not happen with Particl as the BTC codebase is what everybody is used to working with and can integrate it without much effort.</p><p>This public token is also very useful for people who do not necessarily require a permanently anonymous experience. Fully-anonymous currencies can sometimes hinder one’s ability to effectively keep track of financial records and transactions. Some services ask for extra information (i.e. a payment ID for Monero) in order for a transaction to be accepted and there are many situations where one could forget to note that transaction ID down or lose it afterward. There’s also a lot of scenarios where one would need to go back several months into the past to see specific transaction details. In most cases, it is simply harder to keep track of things with fully private coins so having one that does possess great accountability tools is definitively a plus.</p><p>On top of this, a transaction using any privacy coin is generally going to cost more in fees than a public transaction on a non-bloated BTC codebase currency as it typically involves more data movement and computation. A “public user”, one that does not necessarily want to be anonymous, should not have to pay for privacy features he does not need. By making the public token the default coin, this ensures that only users seeking privacy options will use the privacy token, while the public users (which will probably end up being the majority of Particl users if the platform becomes mainstream) default to the public token. This also has the non-negligible effect of putting less stress on the network (as public transactions are more lightweight and do not fill blocks as much as private ones), keeping the network efficient.</p><h3 id=\"private-token\">Private Token</h3><p>Particl’s private token has a variable degree of privacy which can be adjusted by users according to their preferences. In fact, when making a private transaction, it is possible to send it using Confidential Transactions or RingCT (which is a blend of ring signatures and Confidential Transactions). It is noteworthy to mention that <strong>this is the first time both these protocols are being implemented on the Bitcoin codebase</strong>. While a few coins use Confidential Transactions as their privacy protocol, only one uses an implementation of RingCT on their main net: Monero.</p><p>Confidential Transactions, or CT, is a privacy protocol initially developed for Bitcoin that hides amounts sent from the public and makes it visible only to parties involved in the actual transaction. While it is very efficient to obfuscate most regular person-to-person transactions, its most interesting use case is when used in Particl’s marketplace decentralized escrow system. As a matter of fact, if the market’s escrow system worked using the public token, it would be trivial for determined attackers to detect patterns in the public escrow contracts and match them to potential users. On a long enough timeline, users could be identified with particular marketplace orders with a high degree of certainty. With the help of Confidential Transactions, this cuts off this attack vector and makes the escrow system fully anonymous. To learn more about CT, please consult this link: <a href=\"https://people.xiph.org/~greg/confidential_values.txt\">https://people.xiph.org/~greg/confidential_values.txt</a></p><p>RingCT, on the other side, is an even better privacy protocol combining ring signatures to the aforementioned confidential transaction protocol. Applied on double stealth addresses, not only transaction amounts are hidden but the sender and receiver addresses as well, making RingCT transactions completely untraceable. It should be taken into consideration that RingCT will not be available when Particl first launches, but will it be implemented soon enough. This feature is currently on testnet #3, but it still requires some work before it is incorporated into the main chain. The team also wants to have it fully audited by a third-party before going live with it.</p><p>One useful feature of the Particl wallet is that users are actually presented with the option to choose the privacy protocol they want to use according to their needs. CT is a good privacy protocol for basic privacy, but RingCT is even better as it makes transactions unlinkable. However, the latter is much more expensive in fees than the first one, and people who do not require a “paranoid” level of privacy may not want to pay larger fees.</p><p>In my subjective opinion, Particl will offer the best privacy experience on the market as it is very flexible but makes no compromise. RingCT is considered top-of-the-line technology and it simply works fantastically in preserving one’s privacy. Some could argue that ZK-SNARKS offers a better solution, and that is rightfully debatable. They do offer an interesting privacy solution, but they do have their share of problems and vulnerabilities as mentioned above. Centralized coin mixers are obviously not to be trusted as there is no way to know the legitimacy of the website owner, and coinjoin services are demonstrably weak and exploitable by determined adversaries.</p><p>The hidden inflation problem is also one of the reasons why I believe Particl, with its dual token system, has a “safer” (and easier to integrate) implementation of RingCT than Monero. Don’t get me wrong, there are good arguments people could make about Monero having the better integration. For example, RingCT being mandatory and by default on all transactions makes it impossible to make a basic human mistake (they do happen), but it also makes Monero a more expensive currency to use and a blockchain less likely to be able to support a huge influx of users (as transactions are heavy and would bloat the blockchain faster). This is the kind of debate where both sides have pros and cons, so I will let you make your own conclusion on this topic.</p><p>Also related to Particl’s privacy but not its private coin, it is possible to route the wallet’s connection through TOR in order to keep your node IP address private. This is absolutely needed if you want a secure staking setup (unless you used OpenVPN with solid network rules) as broadcasting the real IP address of a staking node to the world is asking for trouble.</p><h2 id=\"decentralized-anonymous-person-to-person-marketplace\">Decentralized &amp; Anonymous Person-to-person Marketplace</h2><p>Quoted from <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf\">Particl’s whitepaper draft</a>: “<em>Satoshi Nakamoto, the visionary and creator of Bitcoin, originally intended that Bitcoin is paired with a marketplace, as evidenced by beginnings of a market framework included in early snapshots of the Bitcoin codebase. The market-related code was eventually stripped out, however, presumably as he decided to focus first on creating his world-changing currency. The concept of a decentralized marketplace in itself is not novel, there have been a small set of academic constructions and even serious attempts at creating them. They either propose solutions that scale extremely well and neglect the privacy implications, or they propose very privacy conscious solutions that do not scale well. Privacy and efficiency are often at odds with each other,” to hide the signal there must be noise”. Tor exemplifies this well, the traffic is pushed through various nodes with several layers of encryption before arriving at its destination, it is deliberately inefficient but the privacy provided by the</em><br><em>trade-off is well worth it”.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-9M6fKKTzuuy1DhCwp7jtGQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl Marketplace mock up posted during the fundraiser (Confirmed outdated, but gives a rough idea where the team is going visually speaking)</figcaption></figure><p>In development for about two years, the Particl marketplace strives to be the <strong>first</strong> decentralized marketplace to <strong>successfully nail scalability and full privacy at the same time</strong>. The team aspires to achieve this accomplishment by using the OMP market protocol they developed internally.</p><h3 id=\"open-market-protocol\">Open Market Protocol</h3><p>The Open Market Protocol, or OMP, is a <em>“standardized and open format that can encompass all the economic interactions of an online marketplace” (</em><a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/\"><em>https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/</em></a><em>#)</em>. The OMP is built with three main components in mind, namely extensibility, privacy, and market data portability. It can be adopted by anyone who wishes to build a decentralized market of some sort.</p><p>Its <em>extensibility</em> characteristic makes it much more resilient to new, more efficient technologies to come out. This aspect is explained in details in the Protocol-agnosticism section of this presentation.</p><p><em>Privacy</em> is also an important cornerstone of this protocol. <em>“Recent revelations and academic papers have proven beyond a doubt that there are many active threats to our digital privacy and security. Additionally, decentralized networks, as well as blockchains, are open public books full of sensitive information for passive attackers to abuse. This was of great concern when designing [the OMP] protocol as it could potentially put [its] users at risk”</em></p><p>Portability is the ability to easily move market data such as inventory, images and shipping details (among others) data between different markets. “<em>One of the many frustrations that online merchants and vendors suffer is the lack of portability of the inventory data between the many different online marketplaces. The more markets your products are available on, the greater their exposure and thus the greater their potential revenue streams. Yet importing the inventory data into another application or website remains a cumbersome process, often on purpose to prevent vendors from using competition” </em>By making market data standardized, it becomes very easy for vendors to open a shop on any marketplace using the OMP protocol and realize their full economic potential.</p><h3 id=\"decentralized-trust-less-escrow-system\">Decentralized &amp; Trust-less Escrow System</h3><p>There are many challenges in designing a fully anonymous and decentralized marketplace. One of these is to ensure that neither the vendors nor the buyers get scammed by the other party. How do you make sure the vendor doesn’t simply take the money and not ship the product? How do you make sure the buyer actually pays for a shipped product? In most cases, typical marketplaces such as Alibaba, eBay or Amazon use what is called an escrow system. The platform acts as a middle-man and receives the payment of a product or service on behalf of the vendor and holds on to it until the buyer confirms he has received the product. Should problems arise, the escrow agent will usually take the role of a mediator and decide what happens to the escrowed funds (it will either be a refund for the buyer or a release of funds to the vendor).</p><p>Since the Particl marketplace aims to be entirely trustless, it cannot use escrow agents as that constitutes centralization. An agent could be wrong on a decision, go rogue, collude with a party, and above all, <strong>they always charge a fee</strong>. No escrow agent will work for free.</p><p>The Particl team developed what they call the MAD escrow system. This trust-less and free service is based on the Mutually Assisted Destruction game theory. As defined on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction\">Wikipedia</a>, Mutual assured destruction (or mutual assisted destruction) “is a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides would cause the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender. It is based on the theory of deterrence, which holds that the threat of using strong weapons against the enemy prevents the enemy’s use of those same weapons. The strategy is a form of Nash equilibrium in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to initiate a conflict or to disarm”.</p><p>In the context of an escrow system, it simply means that the escrow is designed in such a way that it financially punishes both parties if one of them behaves badly. The MAD escrow works by requiring the buyer to deposit twice the amount of the desired product in a 2-of-2 multisig escrow address, while the vendor has to deposit the full value of the item he is selling as insurance. Both parties need to sign the release of the funds before a set time for the deal to conclude, otherwise, the escrow busts and funds are sent over to the stakers.</p><p>For example, if you were selling a 500$ TV to a user, you would have to fund the MAD escrow with 500$ and your buyer would need to fund it with 1,000$ (500$ item value + 100% insurance deposit of 500$). The document section of the shadowproject.io website explains in an understandable fashion how the psychology behind MAD escrow works:</p><p>From <a href=\"https://doc.shadowproject.io/#mutual-assured-destruction-mad\">ShadowProject’s documentation page</a>: <em>“If the buyer receives the item and decides not to finalize the transaction then the address becomes unspendable after the expiration date and neither party gets their insurance deposit back. The buyer will have effectively paid twice the price but the vendor loses his insurance deposit and the item. [If] the vendor does not to ship the item, [it] leaves the buyer with the option to finalize the transaction or not: finalizing the transaction causes him to minimalize his losses to one time the price of the item and the vendor makes a profit of one time the item price. If the buyer decides not to finalize the transaction he loses twice the amount of the item price but also causes the vendor to lose his insurance deposit. The buyer is to some extent at a disadvantage and motivated to finalize the transaction to minimize his losses in case of a vendor scam. Both the buyer and the vendor will be motivated to extend the escrow transaction and work towards a refund agreement that both parties are willing to sign.”</em></p><p>Of course, this MAD escrow system is flexible. If a problem arises during a transaction, both parties can agree to either extend the escrow deadline time or proceed with partial refunds. It is also entirely up to the users to decide what insurance deposit percentage they want to use. A vendor and a buyer could agree for a 25% insurance deposit, meaning that for a 500$ TV purchase, a vendor would need to deposit 125$ into the escrow while the buyer would need to deposit 625$ (500$ + 25% insurance deposit of 125$).</p><h3 id=\"self-governance\">Self-Governance</h3><p>Another of the big challenges in designing a decentralized and anonymous market is trying to reduce the irresponsible and criminal use of the platform as much as possible. Since it is censorship-resistant, no central authority can delete its content and so it could easily be abused by criminals, spammers, and trolls. This would end up making the platform look much less appealing to the regular honest user and enable undesirable activities.</p><p>Particl’s solution to this problem is a self-governance system where users can flag undesirable content. At this moment, it is not confirmed whether a listing considered undesirable is completely taken out of the market or if it puts it in an NSFW kind of state where users can decide whether they want that type of content to be displayed or not (similar to how OpenBazaar does it). The method of governance is also not confirmed, but if we are to speculate, it could possibly be tied to staking like Particl’s voting system works (will be explained later in this document).</p><h3 id=\"private-listings\">Private Listings</h3><p>As mentioned just above, there is a self-governance in place preventing the platform from essentially becoming a decentralized version of the infamous Silkroad marketplace. There is, however, a form of listing which cannot be flagged by the community: private listings. These listings do not appear on the public marketplace and are hidden even from the blockchain itself as they are fully encrypted. Only a vendor and a user possessing a specific link to the listing can have access to its content, making it a very interesting use-case for alternative markets as anyone could simply run a website making external references to these private listings, fundamentally creating the perfect semblance of a 100% anonymous and censorship-proof (even from Particl’s self-governance system) marketplace that cannot get hacked, be busted or exit scam their users.</p><h3 id=\"fighting-spam\">Fighting Spam</h3><p>As mentioned above, spammers are another major concern on popular blockchain platforms. In the crypto world, there are many reasons why one would want to mount a spam attack on a chain. It could be because that entity wants to short the coin on trading markets, or because he has invested in a competing platform that is seeking to destroy the reputation of Particl.</p><p>Fighting spam attacks will always remain an ongoing battle as spammers will always try to find new ways to make themselves an annoyance, and the Particl team plans on keeping the platform spam-free a priority. On market release, the platform will already be armed with two spam-fighting features other than the self-governance flagging system.</p><p>The first one of these measures is to make listings stay up for a maximum of 48 hours. That means a spammer has to constantly keep the attack up otherwise it will not have any long-term damage to the platform. This also helps the market be much more scalable as it only requires to have two days worth of listings. The second measure is the implementation of a very small listing fee (initially 0.01 PART, can be adjusted and ultimately made dynamic) making a sustained attack quite costly for an attacker. While the fees are quite small, mounting a considerably effective spam attack would require large amounts of funds to be paid to the market every two days.</p><p>As will be explained further down this presentation, market fees actually go to the stakers (people who run nodes that secure the network), which brings an interesting dynamic…<strong>Any spammer that wants to heavily spam the Particl marketplace inevitably ends up sending his money to the very community he is trying to bring down!</strong></p><h3 id=\"going-mainstream\">Going Mainstream</h3><p>The project doesn’t hide the fact that it wishes to become the first decentralized marketplace to become used in the multi-billion “mainstream” world of commerce. This is why user-friendliness and usability are at the core of the team’s strategy. The ultimate goal is to make the cryptocurrency side of things all in the background so that even your grandmother could intuitively use it.</p><p>Another mainstream-appealing feature the team is working on is the integration of many in-client fiat gateways from which one could fund his Particl wallet. Some solutions being explored at the moment would allow users to use bank transfers, credit cards, and Localbitcoin-style services. Note, however, that neither the Particl developing team nor the Particl Foundation are licensed financial organizations, therefore this implementation most certainly would be the result of partnerships with other services (i.e. Changelly, Tether, etc.). It would be very surprising if fiat gateways were part of the initial release of the wallet.</p><h3 id=\"low-fees\">Low Fees</h3><p>One great thing about the Particl marketplace is its relatively low prices compared to centralized competitors. In fact, selling on websites such as Amazon or Alibaba is great because they bring vendors a lot of users, but they also charge a huge premium just so their user base can be leveraged. After all, it is generally Amazon/Alibaba/eBay that brings a company new customers, not the other way around, so that premium fee is the price to pay to get new customers from these big e-commerce platforms.</p><p>Let’s take Alibaba, for example. It is one of the most valued e-commerce websites on the internet and has a huge user base of both buyers, merchants, service providers and suppliers. If you wanted to start selling products on it, you would probably want to get a gold membership so you don’t get absolutely buried in the thousands of listing and so that you at least have a minimum set of features you could use. Their gold membership is subscription based and according to Harry Peterson, a professional in China sourcing and B2B (business-to-business) marketing, businesses located in mainland China need to pay almost up to $5,000 USD a year just to get their membership. Businesses outside China mainland have variable subscription fees based on which jurisdiction they are doing business from, but it is estimated that an average subscription amounts to around $2,999 USD a year (<a href=\"https://www.quora.com/How-much-does-it-cost-to-sell-on-Alibaba\">https://www.quora.com/How-much-does-it-cost-to-sell-on-Alibaba</a>). On the Alibaba website itself, subscription fees seem to be even higher, now priced at $5,999 USD a year for the full package (<a href=\"http://seller.alibaba.com/memberships/index.html\">http://seller.alibaba.com/memberships/index.html</a>).</p><p>Of course, there are various packages and these fees are somewhat flexible, but that gives you an idea what a gold membership costs if you want to use Alibaba as a platform and get the whole set of features that will allow you to leverage the full capacity of what the platform has to offer. Don’t forget that on top of these memberships, Alibaba charges a whopping 5% fee on any transactions done through its escrow system, as it is centralized and requires staff to manage. All these fees, end up being costly for both buyers and sellers. Remember that Particl’s MAD (mutually assisted destruction) escrow system is absolutely free of charge as it is entirely decentralized and managed by both the buyer and the vendor.</p><p>Amazon, on the other hand, chooses a different fee schedule to make its money by applying two types of fees. The first one is a generic “per-item” selling fee. You can choose two plans: the individual plan, which charges $0.99 USD per items sold, or a professional plan, which is a subscription of $39,99 USD per month (<a href=\"https://services.amazon.com/selling/pricing.htm\">https://services.amazon.com/selling/pricing.htm</a>).</p><p>On top of that, it also charges what is called a “referral fee” which is a percentage of your item’s value that Amazon keeps for itself. This fee ranges from 6% to an almost insulting 25% depending on the item’s category. Some Amazon-branded items can even go up to 45%. Please visit this detailed article to know the exact fee schedule Amazon uses: <a href=\"http://www.cpcstrategy.com/blog/2014/06/sell-on-amazon-pricing/\">http://www.cpcstrategy.com/blog/2014/06/sell-on-amazon-pricing/</a>. There is also another type of fee which Amazon can charge, but that only applies if you want Amazon to fulfill your order (meaning you send your inventory to Amazon and they do the processing, storage, and shipping for you). These fees are all indicated in the CPC strategy article I linked just above.</p><p>What about eBay? While listing an item isn’t really that expensive, your first 50 listings of each month being free and the subsequent being $0.30 USD, the website still charges you a non-negligible 10% “final value fee” (the final value is calculated AFTER shipping fees are applied) with a maximum of $750 USD per transaction. You can visit this link which details all the listings (plus some advanced feature fees I will not go into): <a href=\"http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/fees.html\">http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/fees.html</a></p><p>Etsy? Well, it is admittedly much cheaper, but still considerably more expensive than Particl. They charge $0.20 USD per listing posted and then apply a “transaction fee” of 3.5% (which isn’t applied to shipping cost as well if you are selling either from the USA or Canada but is applied otherwise). There are also various other fees if you wish to use more advanced features such as Etsy’s “Direct Checkout”. For their fee schedule, please visit this link here: <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/legal/fees/\">https://www.etsy.com/legal/fees/</a>.</p><p>As it is probably obvious by now, these platforms charge their users HUGE premiums, which is kind of understandable since they are critical to the success of a good number of these vendors. Particl is going to be a much, much cheaper option for vendors, regardless if they are big or small. It will also greatly benefit buyers by basically charging them no fees at all except low cryptocurrency transaction fees (listing fees are paid for by vendors). Vendors will only need to pay 0.01 PART per listing renewed every two days. This fee is likely to be made dynamic so that it goes down when PART’s price goes up and vice versa.</p><h3 id=\"target-users\">Target Users</h3><p>Going for the mainstream world of e-commerce certainly is a huge ambition. It is true that a decentralized system is likely to be less efficient than its centralized counterparts, but it does also offer services that giants like eBay, Amazon or Alibaba simply cannot provide to their customers: privacy and censorship-resistance. So who, exactly, would end up using a potentially less efficient but more private platform than well-established e-commerce Goliaths?</p><p>During the time of the initial funding round, I’ve <a href=\"https://decentralize.today/who-is-going-to-use-particls-decentralized-anonymous-market-and-why-is-it-so-badly-needed-7eb79cc8b9ad\">written a lengthy article </a>going over exactly this question. Here’s a tl;dr list of potential early users:</p><p>- Controversial &amp; potentially illegal goods &amp; services <br>- Perceived gray area businesses<br>- Unfairly blocked businesses<br>- People looking for better protection of personal/corporate data &amp; documents<br>- Taxation resistance &amp; revolts<br>- People from the unbanked world where banks and e-commerce websites are not present<br>- Much lower fees than centralized counterparts<br>- Any crypto user looking to shop with his favorite coin</p><p>This article only lists what I could think of at the time, but the potential of a decentralized marketplace and escrow system is huge and there are some use-cases one could not think of until someone actually comes out with it. A potential use case not featured in my previous article which became apparent to me since is the use of Particl marketplace’s escrow system for OTC exchange of unreleased ICO coin accounts (trading coins before their chain is released). This seems to be an increasingly popular practice within the crypto world, with most vendors/buyers doing these trades on Slack/Reddit.</p><h3 id=\"currency-agnosticism\">Currency-Agnosticism</h3><p>By definition, “an agnostic person is one who believes it is impossible to know anything about God or about the creation of the universe and refrains from commitment to any religious doctrine”. In our context, the platform is considered “agnostic” because its developing team does not believe its native coin should be created with a “one coin to rule them all” mentality and thus should have a platform that can work with as many cryptocurrencies as possible. As we do not know what coins will be the most used in 5 years, let alone in a month, it is safe and forward-thinking to make the platform be ready to work with them at any time.</p><p>This feature will mostly be used for the Particl marketplace Dapp, as it will allow people to shop online using their favorite cryptocurrency without ever leaving the wallet or having to manually trade their coins prior to purchasing a product. While it may seem like that would reduce Particl’s potential valuation as that would generate less demand for its native coin, it actually does not. Because the market’s decentralized escrow is a 2 of 2 multi-sig CT PART address,<strong> it requires any non-PART purchases to be traded (automatically done by the wallet) for PART to operate.</strong> Vendors do not even need to state what coins they want to accept, as they all get paid in PART. They are then free to Shapeshift back to any coin they want, again without ever leaving the wallet.</p><p>This currency-agnosticism actually brings a lot of value to the platform’s native coin. For one, any order made on the market, whether it is paid using PART, BTC, ETH or any compatible currency, ends up being a buy order for PART. This feature also brings a non-speculative use case for all compatible currencies, as the holders of those coins can now shop online with them and not simply hold them for speculative reasons. This has the potential to end up putting a lot of buy pressure on the PART coin.</p><h3 id=\"shapeshift-integration\">Shapeshift Integration</h3><p>This ability to seamlessly shop with any coin is powered by Shapeshift. That means that any coin available on their platform can be used to shop on Particl. Some of the use cases I personally find interesting is the use of the DGX token (gold-backed cryptocurrency, not yet available on Shapeshift though…) and USDt (fiat USD-backed cryptocurrency) to seamlessly shop with coins that are backed by real assets. Gold bugs will immediately understand why this is a big deal, but let’s pause for a moment and appreciate what opportunity it presents. When was the last time people could just go out and shop using actual gold coins? The way it is designed, the vendor does not even have to “accept” the currency on his store, and you can send tiny fractions of that gold coin (which is obviously impossible with physical bullion). This could become a really big use case for Particl if the world economy ends up crashing and people abandon fiat for value-based assets such as gold. This could even initiate a paradigm shift in how people conduct commerce around the world.</p><p>Note, however, that this Shapeshift integration is a temporary solution as the team plans on designing its own fully decentralized and trust-less currency exchange system. This is due for much later though, and I believe that for the time being Shapeshift will be more than satisfying as an option.</p><h3 id=\"protocol-agnosticism\">Protocol-Agnosticism</h3><p>In this context, being protocol agnostic refers to the fact that the Particl platform does not limit itself to one decentralized data storage protocol, but rather makes it extensible and easy to <strong>integrate various different protocols at the same time, and let the user choose which one he prefers using</strong>. As Kewde, a Particl developer, elegantly puts it on his Open Market Protocol GitBook: <em>“Technology moves at an exponential rate, and the very few protocols that survive the test of time are all designed with extensibility in mind. A protocol looking to be relevant on a long enough timeline should be both robust and flexible enough that it easily allows any developer to securely expand it. The development of decentralized storage networks (DHTs, BitTorrent, IPFS) and blockchain solutions is still young, there aren’t any clear “winners” that meet all criteria nor may there ever be, thus the protocol must accommodate for it”.</em></p><p>To illustrate why this is a good concept, let’s say Particl only uses its native SMSG protocol to run its marketplace on. That would work fine…until the marketplace gets very popular and cannot scale anymore because there are too many people using it. On a protocol-agnostic platform, it would be very easy to simply add a new, more scalable protocol to support the flock of new users, but if it wasn’t designed with extensibility in mind, it would be stuck with a technology that cannot support its own popularity. In most cases, the platform would either be abandoned by its users, require some kind of fork (which is risky), or the developing team would abandon the project and start a new one with better technology.</p><p>In other words, <strong>Particl is designed in such a way that it embraces new protocols instead of being rendered obsolete by them</strong>, and it does so without ever requiring a fork of some kind.</p><h3 id=\"decentralized-network-storage\">Decentralized Network Storage</h3><p>Decentralized storage networks, or DSNs, are decentralized extensions “plugged” into the Particl protocol to help it store data in a decentralized and off-chain fashion. They are what I referred to as “new protocols” in the last section. The use of DSNs is essential as the Particl platform does not store its marketplace data on the blockchain itself as that would quickly bloat it and make everything much more inefficient. Here is an excerpt from Particl’s whitepaper draft: <br> <br> <em>“The Data Storage Network (DSN) is tasked with storing market listings as well as messages between sender and receiver and all other accompanying data (such as but not limited to images and videos). Sensu stricto the market listing references, stored in the blockchain, are also protocol-agnostic, simply meaning it can handle different DSN protocols such as BitMessage, IPFS, HTTPS…”</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-FuY-KpehaQSXH8Bf7634_Q.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of DSNs that could be integrated into Particl:</p><p>- HTTPs (Privacy:- ( — )<br>- TOR (Privacy: + + )<br>- SMSG (Privacy: + + + )<br>- * IPFS (Privacy: + )<br>- * Siacoin (Privacy: + )<br>- * Storj (Privacy: + )<br>- * SafeNetwork (Privacy: + + + )</p><p>* This DSN hasn’t been integrated yet or is not production-ready.</p><p>As there isn’t really a “best” solution, the Particl platform lets users choose which decentralized storage network they want to use. Some DSNs provide great anonymity characteristics but don’t scale as well as others (such as is the case with SMSG). Some provide great scaling capabilities but are more expensive to use. There is also the fact that some of these DSNs required a native token transfer (Sia, Storj, SafeNetwork), making the integration trickier (but still possible) and possibly less interesting for users. Don’t forget that these DSNs which use a native token either charge the uploader of content or the downloader depending on what storage network is being used.</p><p>While DSNs are mostly used by the marketplace application (and the messaging system in the case of SMSG), the agnostic and extensible design has been standardized by the team so that it can be easily deployed whenever the platform needs to interact with third-party software, once again ensuring that it never gets outpaced by new technologies but embraces them instead. It also has the potential to add use-cases to other blockchain projects (for example, providing a complete and decentralized merchant and escrow system to Siacoin).</p><h2 id=\"proof-of-stake-consensus-algorithm\">Proof-of-stake Consensus Algorithm</h2><p>From <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake\">Wikipedia’s proof-of-stake page</a>,<em> “Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a type of algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus. Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) based cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin), where the algorithm rewards participants who solve complicated cryptographical puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining), in PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen in a deterministic (pseudo-random) way, and the chance that an account is chosen depends on its wealth (i.e. the stake)”.</em> Paid at every block, PoS basically financially rewards users for securing the network. It is also much easier to start staking than it is to start mining (as you need to buy a lot of equipment and do some research to understand how it all works), so it could be argued that PoS is a more decentralized and “people-friendly” decentralized consensus algorithm, only requiring users to buy coins, deposit them on their wallet and let it open as often as possible.</p><p>Particl uses a pretty recent version of PoS named PoSv3, and has a variable inflation rate that goes as follow:</p><p>Year 1: 5%<br>Year 2: 4% <br>Year 3: 3%<br>Year 4+: 2%</p><h3 id=\"staking-as-an-investment\">Staking As an Investment</h3><p>Particl’s inflation calendar has been designed this way to support the price during the adoption period by making it quite profitable to stake. Once the marketplace application is more popular and as staking rewards reduce over time, the “burden” of price support should organically transfer from speculators to marketplace users.</p><p>One thing that is important to understand about staking rewards is that you are guaranteed to get a 5% interest profit in the first year <strong>if 100% of the network’s coins are staking. </strong>Staking becomes increasingly more profitable as less and less people stake. This is a direct incentive to get as many nodes staking as possible. However, it is highly unrealistic to think the entire network would be staking as evidenced by Shadowcash’s historical statistics; the percentage of SDCs staking used to oscillate between 35%-50% of the entire network. On Particl, if 50% of the network was to stake their coins, that would mean you could expect an estimated 10% yield on your first year (if you let your wallet open 24/7).</p><p>Another interesting dynamic resulting from the way PoS was implemented is that market fees are paid directly to stakers. As explained earlier, the marketplace asks for a small 0.01 PART listing fee every 48 hours to fight spam. That means that as the market gets more activity, <strong>it becomes even more profitable</strong> for stakers. If it gets popular enough, it could completely nullify the effect of the decreasing inflation rate on staking rewards and possibly even making them bigger in the end. Other fees paid to stakers include regular transaction, CT and RingCT fees. Note that as the platform gets more Dapps other than the marketplace, the fees they generate would generally be sent to stakers.</p><p>Could there even be more financial incentives to stake? Yes, there is! As explained earlier, MAD escrows have a timer that forces both participating parties to release the funds before it runs out. This timer can, of course, be extended if both parties agree to, but what if it is not and the escrow runs out of time? All the funds are added to the staking rewards, which in some cases could amount to pretty big bonus rewards!</p><h3 id=\"staking-as-aparticl-foundation-self-funding-strategy\">Staking As aParticl Foundation Self-Funding Strategy</h3><p>When calculating potential staking rewards, it is important to deduct 10% from the final number. Why? The Particl Foundation didn’t want to simply rely on two funding rounds as they have a very long-term vision for the project, so they had to find a way to get constant funding. A solution they found was to take 10% of daily staking rewards and use those coins to fund the project (hire devs, launch marketing/PR campaigns, etc.). If you are familiar with the DASH project, they were the first ones to adopt such a strategy and it could be argued that it is one of the reasons they are doing so well right now.</p><h3 id=\"economic-dynamics-of-staking\">Economic Dynamics of Staking</h3><p>Since it has been first implemented, proof-of-stake has been observed to propose a different set of economic dynamics than proof-of-work. The major reason why this is so is that stakers don’t actually need to sell their stakes like miners who need to pay for various expenses (electricity, maintenance, temperature management, etc.).</p><p>In fact, if one was to analyze PoS blockchains, he would notice that most staking nodes actually hoard staking rewards rather than cash them out. Since there is no expense tied to staking, it is actually much more beneficial to re-invest (stake) your new rewards as that increasingly makes it more profitable as time goes by, a concept named compounded interest.</p><p>“Compound interest (or compounding interest) is interest calculated on the initial principal and also on the accumulated interest of previous periods of a deposit or loan. Thought to have originated in 17th-century Italy, compound interest can be thought of as “interest on interest,” and will make a sum grow at a faster rate than simple interest, which is calculated only on the principal amount. The rate at which compound interest accrues depends on the frequency of compounding; the higher the number of compounding periods, the greater the compound interest. Thus, the amount of compound interest accrued on $100 compounded at 10% annually will be lower than that on $100 compounded at 5% semi-annually over the same time period.” (<a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp\">http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp</a>)</p><p>For example, at a 5% reward rate, a staker having 1,000 PARTs would end up the year with 1,050 PARTs. On the second year, his 1,050 PARTs would increase by 4%, leaving the staker with 1092 PARTs. Another staker decides to sell his stake as he receives them, so on the first year, he would have made 50 PARTs of profits. However, because he decided to sell his stakes as he receives them, his second year of staking would only yield him 40 PARTs (1,000 * 0.04). Comparing these two stakers, the first one made a 92 PARTs profits while the second one made 90 PARTs. Note, however, that this example has been simplified for the sake of this presentation. In reality, staking rewards are paid at every block, not every year, so this “build-up” effect that causes stakers to get more PARTs rewards as they re-invest actually happens more quickly, making it even more profitable than in this example.</p><p>I’ve made a simple Calc file that allows you to easily calculate your staking rewards depending on the number of market listings, the estimated yearly return rate, and your PART balance. It takes compounded interest into consideration. Please follow this link to download and play with it: <a href=\"http://onlyo.co/2uQdLoM\">http://onlyo.co/2uQdLoM</a></p><p>Another interesting economic dynamic proof-of-stake provides is that it generates a coin supply shock on trading markets.</p><p>There are two main reasons for this. The first one, as explained above, is that stakers demonstrably prefer hoarding over spending their rewards, creating much less selling pressure on markets. Generally, this would make the coin’s price higher as the supply is reduced while demand stays unaffected. The second reason is directly related to the potential gains a staker can make by simply leaving his computer open. Some people would rather not risk trading their assets, so getting a solid 5–10% investment return under a year can be very appealing, making the coin more in demand. Taking both these dynamics into consideration, it could be said that proof-of-stake increases demand while reducing supply, which generally makes the coin more valuable.</p><p>One problem with that, though, is that if not enough people want to sell the currency on the markets (and simply hoard it instead), it can create a kind of liquidity crisis where not enough coins are put for sale. This is far from ideal for speculators with large sums of money who wouldn’t want to <strong>accumulate</strong> coins on an illiquid market as making a large order could dramatically increase the coin’s price. It is also not a very good marketplace currency as you want to easily be able to buy it at a relatively stable price. To understand why simply ask yourself if it makes sense to have the price increase by 10% just because you made a large PART order to buy a 10,000 USD car on its market. This is not sustainable, so what would be the best way to have a healthy and profitable balance between supply and demand?</p><h3 id=\"currency-agnosticism-proof-of-stake-combo\">Currency-Agnosticism &amp; Proof-of-stake Combo</h3><p>I believe Particl already has a working solution implemented to balance its staking dynamics with Shapeshift. Remember how I said the market is currency-agnostic and uses Shapeshift to seamlessly exchange other coins into PARTs? Well, it’s not just the marketplace itself, but the entire Particl platform that is so, making it very easy and tempting to actually diversify your portfolio by shape shifting your rewards into other coins. Even though it can be historically demonstrated that stakers would rather keep their rewards than selling them, a proof-of-stake consensus protocol has never been implemented on a currency-agnostic platform.</p><p>Everybody says it: diversification is the key to a profitable and healthy portfolio and staying in only one currency is actually pretty risky. What an easy Shapeshift withdrawal option provides is the ability to very easily diversify your rewards. That means you could instantly convert PART rewards into available coins, be it BTC, ETH, DGX (100% gold-backed cryptocurrency, likely to be added to Shapeshift soon) or even USDt (USD-backed cryptocurrency). The concept of being able to be rewarded in any currency of your choice is actually quite novel and powerful, so it could be reasonably expected that this function will be used a lot.</p><p>For example, I know that I will personally keep around 50% of my own staking rewards in PARTs and shapeshift the rest into whatever currency I like at a given time. I’m surely not the only one who will use the Shapeshift integration this way…This would make the balance between supply and demand more healthy and has the added benefit of making stakers’ portfolios much more secure through diversification. Just pick a couple of coins you like and increase your bags every day!</p><h3 id=\"decentralized-voting-chain-governance\">Decentralized Voting &amp; Chain Governance</h3><p>Most cryptocurrencies are designed with full immutability in mind, meaning their state (blockchain data &amp; code) cannot be modified after it is launched (or spent, in the case of a transaction). However, recent events in crypto have shown us that a fully immutable approach to a blockchain perhaps isn’t optimal. In fact, if you are reading this presentation, chances are that you are aware of both the BTC <strong>scalability debate deadlock</strong> and the past split of the Ethereum chain (ETH &amp; ETC) caused by a <strong>contentious hardfork.</strong></p><p>In the first case, Bitcoin requires finding a solution to help it scale better in order to allow for more transactions per second. There are two popular solutions to fix scalability, one that requires a change to the coin’s protocol (blocksize increase) and one that doesn’t (Segwit implementation). To make things worse, their community is actually split into several groups, mainly the community (traders, holders), devs (Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Unlimited) and miners. All these groups have their own motives and interests, and that makes coming to a middle-ground and making a decision all can agree to extremely hard. Also, because Segwit only requires miners to signal for it, it could be argued that the actual trading/holding community doesn’t have much weight in this whole debate as they can have only a very minimal impact on the signaling.</p><p>In the second case, Ethereum community was faced with a tough decision last year when their The DAO smart-contract got hacked and somebody was draining all funds from it. They had the choice to either let the attacker get away with all the funds, or make a modification to the “The DAO” contract that would have blocked the attack and refunded everyone. The second option, however, required a hardfork and it ended up being quite contentious, causing a chain split (Ethereum and Ethereum Classic). Furthermore, the polling method the Ethereum Foundation chose to use was a bit confusing. They first proposed a “Carbon Vote”, which was a method they quickly implemented to allow people to vote based on the number of coins they were holding. After much criticism, notably from the mining community, they then opted to adopt a more classic method of polling in crypto which is based on miner’s hashing rate (actually almost identical to how Bitcoin is polling its community to implement Segwit or not).</p><p>We can easily see the main issues with how both scenarios dealt with/are dealing with critical decisions. First, simply relying on miner signaling probably isn’t entirely fair to the rest of the community who doesn’t mine. It is true that anyone can use his computer to mine on whatever pool they want based on what decision the pool is taking (what is it signaling for), but not anyone has the knowledge or gear to do it, and whether this can rival the mining farm’s massive hashing rates is arguable. Also, even though the Ethereum Foundation says it also took the Carbon Vote in consideration when deciding to go for the hardfork, there were a lot of complaints from people saying they actually never heard of it. After all, only a very tiny percentage of the network went ahead and voted, so perhaps it was too complicated for most people or that the word didn’t spread fast and far enough. What makes it worse is that the voting was based on how many coins you were holding, basically making it a 1 coin = 1 vote. While that is not a bad thing in itself, it is relatively easy to game for anyone with deep pockets. An entity with a lot of money could have bought a large sum of coins, put them up for voting, and then dumped them once it’s said and done.</p><p>So with these lessons in mind, the Particl team decided to natively implement a voting system on its blockchain that can be used any time a tough decision needs to be taken by any party. Note, however, that this voting system isn’t only used to upgrade the protocol, it can be used by anybody for any reason. It could even be a vendor using the system to poll his customer base about what product they want to be added to the store, for example. They knew the system had to have a couple of key characteristics to be optimal, namely being as decentralized, cheap and limit abuse/fraud as much as possible. So how did they do it?</p><p>The Particl voting system is based on staking and is absolutely free. People wanting to vote on a particular matter need to first select their desired voting option and then make their wallet enabled for staking (which has the added benefit of further securing the network). Every time they stake a block, that will count as 1 vote. The entity who first sets up the vote parameters needs to specify to the community for how long the voting period will be open, specified in terms of block numbers (i.e. for a period of 2,500 blocks). This makes it harder to game as a large entity cannot simply buy, vote and dump instantly. They need to hold the coins for X number of blocks and actually secure the network doing so. Additionally, not only is it completely free to vote, it rewards voters with staking rewards, which definitively is an incentive to vote on stuff and not just hold the coins and go with the flow. The in-wallet integration (notably using widgets) also makes it very easy and user-friendly to participate. The only thing that requires a bit of research is that the voting content (description of the vote, pictures, graphs, etc.) will be done off-chain, most likely on Github at the beginning. Once IPFS or similar DSNs are implemented, it would then be trivial to also make the voting content in-wallet.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-BMvbHi93DbicQue6FOuGDw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>A CLI example of a user voting for option 2 on Proposal #5 from block 124 to 2,500</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-MRGH2pEBnZyaDl-CPbWGZA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>A staked block’s vote result (a staker voted for option 1 on proposal 10 at block #167)</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-6DVsuZ-OQtnA6M5E6YwdHg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl wallet showing voting results displayed in a GUI widget</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"decentralized-anonymous-encrypted-messaging-system\">Decentralized &amp; Anonymous Encrypted Messaging System</h2><p>“<em>Communication is an essential component of doing business. Modern technology gives us cheap, reliable and effortless methods to communicate with others regardless of physical distance. However, this technology does little to safeguard the content of our messages from the scrutiny of interested observers. We live in an age of constant and ubiquitous surveillance, where it becomes more difficult by the day to retain our privacy. Privacy is paramount when conducting business, the consequences of invasions of privacy can be devastating to both businesses and individuals, whether the attacker is a rival firm, a malicious individual or an overbearing government”. (</em><a href=\"https://doc.shadowproject.io/#encrypted-messaging\"><em>https://doc.shadowproject.io/#encrypted-messaging</em></a><em>)</em></p><p>Particl has its own messaging system, SMSG, used as a DSN to host listings on and <em>“to perform communication between merchant and buyer. All nodes participating in the network store all messages of the past 48 hours, this means anyone in the network could have been the sender or receiver. The benefit of the decentralized topology is that there are no direct ties between the messages and any IP addresses. Nodes must try to decrypt all incoming messages to check if it was destined for them”.</em></p><p>As explained in the Particl whitepaper draft, <em>“A message traveling on the BitMessage network does not include metadata that can reveal who the receiver or sender is. Only the encrypted payload, IV, HMAC and temporary public key are public, the receiver of a message is the only able to decrypt the message and only for them the HMAC will properly verify.” </em>(<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf\">https://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf</a>)</p><p>While there is definitely some area of improvements the team is currently working on, notably concerning dual-key stealth addresses, future and forward secrecy, scalability, blockchain key distribution and RMIDs efficiency, this p2p messaging system offers a safe option for people looking to communicate and host market listings with the highest level of privacy possible.</p><h3 id=\"native-segwit-implementation\">Native Segwit Implementation</h3><p>Another sweet feature of the Particl blockchain is that it has a native implementation of Segwit, which I believe is a first in crypto. One small inconvenience with blockchain projects forking their chain to add Segwit is that witness blocks aren’t compatible with blocks prior to the fork. While this is not a critical problem, it sure makes things smoother and easier to have a fully compatible Segwit implementation.</p><p>Having segregated witness on Particl gives its blockchain a couple of interesting features. Among many of these, some notable ones are the <strong>Lightning Network</strong>, <strong>transaction malleability vulnerability fixes</strong>, and <strong>block capacity/size increase</strong>.<br> <br> Lightning Network is a payment channel protocol first proposed by Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja and now scheduled for implementation on Bitcoin as well as some altcoins. LN gives interesting features to whatever coin decides to implement it such as <strong>reduced transaction fees</strong>, <strong>increased transaction speed</strong>, better privacy, and <strong>atomic swaps.</strong></p><p>As it is becoming more and more likely as time goes by that the Lightning Network will be implemented in various different coins, its atomic swap feature is getting more relevant. Atomic swapping is the ability of an LN-enabled blockchain to be made inter-operable through <strong>multi-signature addresses</strong> and <strong>time-locks</strong> with many other LN-enabled blockchains in order to allow trust-less coin exchange between two parties (i.e. Alice can trade 100 LTC to Bob for 1 BTC in a 100% decentralized and counterparty-free fashion). This could even be used to create decentralized multi-coin payment processors or exchanges, effectively spawning a brand new and potentially breakthrough <strong>LN-focused ecosystem</strong> in which Particl could be part of. It also seems plausible that the Particl platform would eventually leverage this feature to allow trust-less currency exchange on its marketplace as well as other Dapps, effectively replacing Shapeshift with a cheaper and decentralized alternative, even though the team hasn’t made any statement on the matter.</p><h2 id=\"industry-leading-user-friendly-graphical-wallet\">Industry-leading &amp; User-friendly Graphical Wallet</h2><p>All the aforementioned Particl features wouldn’t be as exciting if they weren’t supported by a user-friendly and eye-appealing wallet. Not everyone wants to use terminal-based wallets and even fewer people know how to. Fortunately, the Particl team has some of the best graphical designer and UI/UX devs in the crypto scene, as evidenced by their previous work on Shadowcash’s Umbra wallet built using HTML5.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-KttFKS_tel6YuhGReMv9kw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Graphical designed of SDC’s Umbra wallet, Particl’s prototype released in 2016</figcaption></figure><p>This time, the team has taken their GUI work to the next level! Started from scratch, the Particl wallet is built using the open-source project Electron (<a href=\"https://electron.atom.io/\">https://electron.atom.io/</a>) and AngularJS (<a href=\"https://angular.io/\">https://angular.io/</a>) as its main framework. The Particl wallet does away with the QtWebKit engine on which is created all the crypto Qt wallets to make it more <strong>secure, beautiful and flexible</strong>. At this stage of adoption, it is very important for a blockchain project eyeing the mainstream to have its platform as easy to use as possible. Indeed, Particl’s end-game is to make almost everything related to crypto work seamlessly in the background while offering users a very intuitive experience not more complicated than using web-based marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay, etc. A web portal (a website where one could use the Particl marketplace without even downloading the wallet and blockchain) is even planned for later, though the team is currently focusing on first releasing the market.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-D-85sM7GwLoHE2gNLuhoDg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl’s “Send” page</figcaption></figure><p>Security-wise, Electron offers substantial improvements over QtWebKit because of how rendered processes are sandboxed leveraging Chromium’s rendering engine. “A sandbox, in computer security, is a security mechanism in which a separate, restricted environment is created and in which certain functions are prohibited” (<a href=\"https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27682/sandbox-computer-security\">https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27682/sandbox-computer-security</a>). In Particl’s context, it means that if an attacker was to exploit a vulnerability within a Chromium rendered process, the damage would severely be limited to this very process and could not spread to other processes due to the engine’s sandbox.</p><p>On the aesthetics side, the interface is made much more appealing than the famous Qt engine. Written entirely in HTML, CSS, and Angular, it is much more interactive than any crypto wallet currently released and is designed with a “modular” approach to it. Indeed, the wallet supports the use of many widgets which can be selected by the user depending on what information they want to quickly be able to glance at. They display much useful information about the wallet in a neat visual fashion, and users can very easily customize how their wallet looks by adding/removing whatever widget they want. Elements they can display include (but are not limited to) staking data, voting data, transaction history, marketplace data, network data, etc. As they are basically only visual representation of blockchain/p2p data, it is very easy to add more of them. It will be interesting to see what the community comes up with in terms of useful widgets they can code and add to Particl. Also, as the project advances in time and new Particl Dapps are created, using widgets will lead to very different and personalized experiences from person to person depending on what is their main reason to use the Particl wallet (staking investment, shopping, holding, gambling on a Particl Dapp, etc.).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-DQmkHEn_IU0S5ymg4P1oug.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl wallet widgets overview & responsive capability</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-ukw96KJfPVy6VXrF6Yxuww.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl’s “Receive” page</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-git6mMXlfrz_Lb-dEi2Sgg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl’s “Settings” page</figcaption></figure><p>For more screenshots of the Particl wallet, you can either visit this link of GUI progress screenshots (<a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/AwNSX\">http://imgur.com/a/AwNSX</a>, posted on May 22nd, so may be outdated) or simply go ahead and participate in testnet #4 which is the first iteration of Particl testnet to include a GUI version.</p><h3 id=\"wallet-installer\">Wallet Installer</h3><p>Another useful feature the GUI wallet will have is an installer that automatically pops up the first time a user launches the wallet and offers to set up lots of stuff such as wallet file importation, privacy sliders (a user can choose how much privacy he needs to set up DSNs), tor installation, etc. Again, as the project grows, a lot can be added to the installer to make it even more useful and render the experience as user-friendly and customizable as possible.</p><h2 id=\"future-features\">Future Features</h2><p>Even though Particl will already offer quite an impressive set of features on day 1, the team has lots of goodies planned for the future.</p><p>One of them is a mobile wallet with ALL desktop features enabled, including messaging and marketplace shopping. The only aspect the team is not sure about integrating into its mobile wallet is staking since it has a couple of drawbacks (potentially high number of unstable nodes due to bad phone reception, battery draining, possible security vulnerabilities, etc.).</p><p>Fiat gateways are also high on the list of priorities. While a solid crypto marketplace could find its niche within the crypto world, it would be much more difficult to go mainstream if it didn’t support integrated fiat deposits and withdrawals. In a way, this is already covered through the Shapeshift integration using Tether (USDt), but more options are always appreciated. The team is considering partnerships with fiat gateways like Changelly which allows the use of credit cards as a funding method or using exchange API keys to integrate fiat pairs into the wallet.</p><p>Another future feature of the project is to establish web portals on which people can access some (or all) functions included in the desktop wallet. The end-game here is to allow people to shop on the marketplace using a website and without having to download the wallet and the entire blockchain. This would make it much easier for regular, non-crypto people to use and is one of the things that could greatly help Particl have a shot at becoming mainstream.</p><p>The team is also looking to integrate more DSNs through partnerships (Siacoin, SafeNetwork, IPFS, etc.) and others method of network routing such as i2p. This is of course with the goal to provide users with a vast array of choices to suit their security needs and budget (as DSNs can vary in pricing fees).</p><h2 id=\"competition\">Competition</h2><p>With all that being said, it is now time to look at who are Particl’s competitors. After all, the crypto world is now an extremely competitive space and it could lead to several BETA vs VHS or Blu-ray vs HD DVD situations where many projects would compete in the same sector until one becomes big enough to stomp its competitors out of business. Hopefully for Particl, it has one huge advantage in the fact that it actually competes in several sectors, dramatically increasing its exposure and chances of success. Please note that the following paragraphs will contain a lot of subjective opinions on why I believe Particl is a serious competitor in many industries, so take it with a grain of salt and come up with your own conclusions.</p><h3 id=\"as-a-currency\">As A Currency</h3><p>Particl definitely meets the criteria to be considered a competitor in the payment currency sector of crypto. Not only does it possess all the same features as Bitcoin and other similar currencies, it literally hosts a decentralized marketplace on its wallet on which its native currency is used to trade goods and services. This is a use-case that very few currencies can claim to have, but it doesn’t stop there.</p><p>Particl also directly competes in the field of privacy coins where Monero, Zcash (and similar ZK SNARKS coins) and DASH are furiously battling. Just as in the payment currency sector, Particl doesn’t need to shy away here at all. It does possess a similar (and <strong>arguably</strong> better) implementation of Monero’s privacy tech, RingCT, and even adds Lightning Network + CT on top of it for a very impressive privacy combo (<strong>RingCT + CT + LN combo</strong>). This should be very interesting for a lot of people and projects that wanted to easily add a RingCT coin to their platform (i.e. Jaxx wallet).</p><h3 id=\"as-a-marketplace\">As A Marketplace</h3><p>Another obvious crypto sector in which Particl is a serious competitor is with decentralized marketplaces. This space has a limited number of competitors such as OpenBazaar, Syscoin and Bitify. Personally, as an investor, my subjective opinion is that decentralized marketplaces are going to become a big thing in the years to come. This is why I research these projects a lot, and my conclusion is that Particl has the most potential to be adopted as a market through its user-friendliness and the many features detailed throughout this presentation. Its two main competitors, OpenBazaar and Syscoin, do have some interesting features but I believe they will not outperform Particl in terms of both popularity and investment returns. <br> <br> In the case of OpenBazaar, it is simply not possible to invest in it and while it charges no fee, its user experience is years away from any kind of mass adoption and has a p2p approach I am not too fond of. It also offers poor privacy and security parameters and should not be relied on by vendors looking for the ultimate privacy experience. What I find to be the most annoying thing about OB is that a vendor needs to host his shop on a computer/server and leave it open all the time. Failing that, the listing is put offline and the vendor cannot make any sale. It is possible to host your shop on a third-party server to make it more reliable in terms of uptime, but that is taking the control out of your hands and a security risk as well as going against the decentralization principle of the crypto world. OpenBazaar plans to launch a second version of their marketplace using IPFS which would allegedly eliminate the need to have a computer open at all time, but that does imply that they will need to introduce a fee structure to their platform.</p><p>With Syscoin, there are other problems that I see. The first one is that the user-experience is simply horrible and the wallet itself is not eye-appealing at all. Their solution for this was to create BlockMarket, a more user-friendly but <strong>closed-source</strong> interface interacting with the Syscoin blockchain. While it is definitely better looking than its Syscoin backend, it is still years away from any kind of mass adoption and its look would most likely turn off anyone that is not involved in crypto. What worries me the most about Blockmarket, however, is that it is basically a glorified centralized marketplace. In fact, The Blockchain Foundry (the company who developed BlockMarket) has total control over what content is hosted on its market. It can ban users and delete/censor listings at will, which leads me to wonder why one would even use the platform as it actually doesn’t provide much that centralized marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay don’t. It also doesn’t provide the set of privacy tools Particl offers, making it a no-go for any vendor looking for high levels of privacy. Also, purely from an investment, I believe Syscoin to not be as worth it as Particl because people can use other currencies on BlockMarket without having to touch Syscoin wat all. This is also the case with Particl, however, the latter automatically converts all other currencies into its native coin (PART) in order for a market order to be possible, so even though a user buys something with Bitcoin, it ends up being a Particl transaction, generating demand. It also should be noted that Particl is PoS while Syscoin is PoW, and I believe the proof-of-stake protocol is more fitted for a marketplace as it allows a lot of great features such as decentralized market governance and market fee earnings. Lastly, another problem I see with Syscoin is that should it become very popular, it would have some serious troubles with scalability as all market data are stored directly on-chain (contrary to Particl which stores data off-chain on DSNs).</p><p>Though it may seem that I am hating on the other projects, really I am not. I do believe this kind of industry can and will have enough place for more than one marketplace. After all, we have Etsy, eBay, Amazon, Craigslist and Alibaba all co-existing and sharing the same space, but with each one having its niche features and appeal to different audiences. There is nothing indicating that this could not be the case in the crypto world as well. Here, Particl definitely is the most secure and private solution, and this is what excites me the most as a privacy enthusiast.</p><p>We should also not forget about centralized, well-established marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay. These giants sure do have a huge share of the global market and have some really great features decentralized marketplace can probably not even dream of offering (at least for now), but they do have negatives that decentralized solutions can do better. Please refer to the previous “Target Users” section of this presentation, or read my previous article on this very subject by following this link: <a href=\"https://decentralize.today/who-is-going-to-use-particls-decentralized-anonymous-market-and-why-is-it-so-badly-needed-7eb79cc8b9ad\">https://decentralize.today/who-is-going-to-use-particls-decentralized-anonymous-market-and-why-is-it-so-badly-needed-7eb79cc8b9ad</a></p><p>I believe that decentralized marketplaces can compete with centralized ones in these aspects:</p><p>- Controversial &amp; potentially illegal goods &amp; services <br>- Perceived gray area businesses<br>- Unfairly blocked businesses<br>- People looking for better protection of personal/corporate data &amp; documents<br>- Taxation resistance &amp; revolts<br>- People from the unbanked world where banks and e-commerce websites are not present<br>- Much lower fees than centralized counterparts<br>- Any crypto user looking to shop with his favorite coin</p><h3 id=\"as-a-dapp-platform\">As A Dapp Platform</h3><p>Even though the competition with Dapp platforms such as Ethereum, Stratis, Lisk or Tezos in not as direct as Particl competition in the marketplace sector, it is still a platform on which more “Dapps” than the marketplace will be built. It is very important to understand that we are not talking about smart-contract Dapps here, but rather hard-coded decentralized applications. To give you an idea, a year or so ago, an SDC community member had started working on a dice Dapp that allowed people to gamble directly on the SDC wallet. The project was abandoned and the community member disappeared, but that gives a good idea of what kind of Dapps Particl could host. The use of DSNs open up a lot of possibilities, I wouldn’t be surprised if we ended getting decentralized Netflix/Youtube/Music Stores powered by DSNs such as IPFS or Siacoin.</p><p>The main difference with Ethereum in terms of Dapp is that Ethereum is more like an operating system similar to Linux where users are given full liberty to code any smart-contract with its native programming language (Solidity), whereas Particl is more like a WeChat-style application on which apps (not smart-contracts) can be added to. To get a better idea, Paul Schmitzer, Particl’s communication manager, floated the idea that Particl could one day have its own “app store” from which users could install whatever decentralized application they want to have on their Particl wallet. It is worth noting that Particl Dapps are probably going to be much more scalable than smart-contract platforms as they would work using DSNs (SMSG is not immensely scalable, but IPFS, Siacoin or SafeNetwork are).</p><h2 id=\"conclusion-personal-comments\">Conclusion &amp; Personal Comments</h2><p>For all the reasons and features mentioned during this presentation, I believe Particl is one of the most under-rated and undervalued projects of the crypto space at the moment. Its impressive set of privacy tools, its highly profitable staking reward schedule, and its highly scalable marketplace/Dapp ecosystem makes it extremely likely that Particl will become a popular and widely used crypto-currency in the not-so-distant future. Another thing that I really like about it is that it is building an entire <strong>ecosystem</strong> rather than being a simple “feature coin” (a coin that mostly does ONE thing well). Not only does having a working ecosystem around your coin make it more resilient to being outdated by newer technologies, it also creates a real demand for it rather than just deriving its value from trade speculation. This ecosystem is supported by a 5% (which will most likely turn into 10%) yearly investment return, on which is added market/Dapps/Txs fees and busted escrow funds.</p><p>Let’s crunch some numbers. If one would buy <strong>$25,000 </strong>worth of PARTs at <strong>$25</strong>, it would give him a total of <strong>1,000 PARTs</strong>. If he were to stake his entire balance, he would be guaranteed 5% yearly, paid every day. The actual more likely number would probably be 8–10%, so let’s round it up to 9%. This staker would make around <strong>0.25 PARTs per day</strong> (1,000 x 0.09 / 365 = 0.24657), or about<strong> $6.16</strong>. At the end of a full year, considering no PARTs were spent, he would have an estimated balance of around 1090 PARTs, a 9% increase valued at around<strong> $2,250 profits</strong>. The actual formula to estimate staking profits per day is as follow: Balance x estimated yearly % returns / 365 x PART price</p><p>That amount, however, is assuming that no transaction happens in the marketplace and that no one makes any transaction on the blockchain since no transaction fees are added into the formula. To calculate how many additional PARTs one would from the marketplace fees, it is possible to use this formula:</p><p>(Estimated number of marketplace listings x 0.01 x 0.5) / 100 x (PART balance x 100 / Particl total circulating supply)</p><p>If the marketplace was to host<strong> 50,000 listings</strong>, the staker in the example above would receive an additional <strong>0.3 PART a day</strong>, or<strong> 11.93 PARTs a year</strong>. At <strong>$25 </strong>per coin, that would earn him additional $298.20 per year for a total of <strong>$2,548.20.</strong></p><p>Again, there are some missing numbers that are harder to calculate such as daily transaction fees and busted escrow funds, so it is almost certain that the actual staking profits the staker in this example would make in real life would be bigger. It is also not taking into consideration the future Particl Dapps that will end up generating fees as well, making staking rewards even larger. I really do believe these interesting figure could propel Particl into top 10 cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Please visit this link to download a spreadsheet I’ve made that will help you calculate your staking revenues taking compounding, Particl Foundation donation and market fees into consideration: <a href=\"http://onlyo.co/2uQdLoM\">http://onlyo.co/2uQdLoM</a></p><p>The only major problem I see with the currency itself is that it could eventually have scalability problems similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum during popular ICOs. Yes, the project will soon get Lightning Network once it is ready, but it is likely that it would be mostly useful for micro-transactions rather than ALL types of transactions. Besides, RingCT transactions cannot be processed through LN and are certainly NOT lightweight in terms of what space they use within a block. Even though I have heard from one solid and reliable source that the team does have plans and methods they are exploring that could potentially make its currency scalable similar to DASH’s levels, nothing has been publicly revealed (or even hinted at), so it shouldn’t be taken into consideration until this is publicly discussed. However, if Particl should ever have currency scalability problems, it would actually be a pretty good problem as that means the platform would already be quite popular and its coin very valuable. Note that there is a distinction to make between currency scalability and market scalability, the latter being already successfully dealt with.</p><h2 id=\"additional-resources\">Additional Resources</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://particl.io/\">Particl landing page</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/\">Particl news</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/\">Particl’s GitHub</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf\">Whitepaper draft</a></li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/particlproject\">Particl Twitter account</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/\">Particl Reddit page</a></li><li><a href=\"http://slack.particl.io/\">Slack channel invite</a></li><li><a href=\"https://riot.im/app/#/room/#particl:matrix.org\">Riot channel</a></li><li><a href=\"https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Particl-Testnet-Getting-Started-d9yhExvCaW6vCp3qLUwuW\">Latest testnet binaries</a></li><li><a href=\"http://explorer.testnet.particl.io/insight/\">Testnet block explorer</a></li><li>Contact info: <a href=\"mailto:hello@particl.io\">hello@particl.io</a></li></ul><p>This concludes this Particl presentation.

Thank you!</em></p><p>Hey guys,</p><p>I’ve been following an interesting cryptocurrency project for some time and have noticed that very little information was available about it online, so I’ve decided to write a complete in-depth presentation of it. I do believe this project has a lot of potential investment-wise due to its great technology and vision, this is why I wanted to share it with you. This article is going to be quite lengthy, so buckle up.</p><hr><h2 id=\"what-is-particl\">What is Particl?</h2><p>To sum it up briefly, Particl is a privacy-focused blockchain/P2P hybrid ecosystem that will host a decentralized and anonymous marketplace as well as an array of Dapps using a native cryptocurrency. The first officially supported Particl Dapp will be a fully decentralized and anonymous marketplace which allows buyers and vendors to securely transact between each other without the need to ever interact with a third-party. It also encompasses a fully anonymous messaging system built similarly to BitMessage. The platform is currency and protocol agnostic (more details on what this means later in the presentation).</p><p>Note, however, that these Dapps are not the same kind of Dapps as on Ethereum. They do NOT work using smart contracts but are instead hard-coded into the client. This makes Dapps much more secure and efficient.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-its-history\">What’s Its History?</h2><p>Particl is the successor of the ShadowProject (<a href=\"https://shadowproject.io/en\">https://shadowproject.io/en</a>), a privacy-focused cryptocurrency project started back in August 2014. The team behind this project are known for being innovators in the cryptocurrency scene, being the first to produce many feats such as an HTML5 wallet, a staking mobile wallet with encrypted messaging and transactions, as well as having the first ring signature and HD wallet implementation on BTC codebase. Their Umbra graphical wallet, built using HTML5, is widely known in the “altcoin” community for being absolutely gorgeous and very user-friendly. It was not so long after switching from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake that this very capable team started working on a fully anonymous and decentralized marketplace. This has long been seen has the ultimate value proposition of the Shadowcash blockchain.</p><p>Back in late December 2016, word spread around the community that the ShadowProject team had met with major partners in Hong Kong and that big things were coming regarding the way forward. Then, on March 17th, the team announced they were leaving the ShadowProject to start working on a new and more professional project: Particl. This move was encouraged by the fact that the team wanted to have a more professional branding and were looking for funding so that they could work full-time on it and get it going for good. In fact, they had been told by the Hong Kong partners, as well as many legal and PR firms, that the name “Shadowcash” was deemed too shady, most of them even refusing to associate their name with such a sketchy sounding project. The new vision of the project also required a lot of major code changes to be done to the SDC blockchain/client and team structure. It is for all these reasons the SDC team decided to completely sever the link between Shadowcash and Particl and start the new blockchain from scratch, using their final Umbra release as prototype for the new platform.</p><h2 id=\"the-particl-foundation\">The Particl Foundation</h2><p>The Particl Foundation is a registered Swiss legal entity. As the Particl team was looking to raise money to fund the project, they needed to have a legal body that could receive the funds and spend on behalf of the project. It is also required for most of the logistics of the project (hiring and paying employees, paying hosting fees for the website, etc.) as well as interacting with third-parties (partners, exchanges, gateways, legal &#x26; PR firm contracts, etc.). There will be many more details to come once the Foundation is officially registered. It is currently awaiting approval by the Swiss government and it is the last step to be up and running.</p><p>As a funding strategy, the Particl team offered SDC holders an opportunity to swap their SDCs for PARTs at a 1:1 rate, with the possibility for the holder to add an additional amount of BTC to the swap transaction to get a variable PART bonus added to their stash. This extra BTC is what the team collected as funding as SDCs sent into swap transactions were not and will never be sold into the market.</p><p>They have raised 750,000 USD worth of Bitcoin (now worth around 1.4M), and reserved for themselves 513,502 PARTs (6% of total supply) from the total supply. Another 996,000 PARTs are reserved for a second funding round once the MVP of the market is out and released. The funds they raised will be used for salaries, legal expenses for Swiss Foundation creation, initial business consultation expenses, new team members, professional PR, third-party code audits and University grants.</p><p>While it may have been tempting to raise more money, the reasoning behind this crowdfund structure is actually quite sane. The total amount raised is what the team estimated were necessary to run the project for one full year. It is true that other ICOs are raising tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars, but in many cases, the development team simply doesn’t need that much money. It could be argued that as these projects raise tons of money, they lose a certain incentive to work hard on their project as they have already cashed out on their idea. In more traditional VC environments, you would very rarely (if ever) see projects raise hundreds of millions of dollars with only ideas, vague whitepaper, and no working products. It is also likely that some of these projects will attract the attention of regulatory bodies due to questionable funding methods.</p><p>The Particl team has mimicked the VC way of initially going through a seed round before going for a larger round of funding. This crowdfund strategy is what was advised by Swiss legal firms which are used to working with blockchain projects. Also, not only does this structure allows for a fair money-raising method, it also incentivizes the Particl team to work hard on their project and deliver a working product that will impress the community. After all, they will want to raise as much money as possible in the second round, and with a maximum of 996,000 PARTs that can be offered, they have all the reasons in the world to make a good product which would bring more value to the Particl coin. When we think about it, this crowdfunds/ICO was pretty fair and exemplary from a legal standpoint.</p><h2 id=\"particl-features\">Particl Features</h2><p><strong>Quick video presentation:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRxmGh24ILU\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRxmGh24ILU</a></p><p><strong>Release date:</strong> <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-blockchain-will-launch-monday-july-17th-2017-at-13-00-utc-3348e8958657\">July 17th 2017, 13:00 UTC</a></p><p><strong>Currency name: </strong>Particl (not to be confused with Particle)</p><p><strong>Currency ticker: </strong>PART (not PRT, which is Particle’s ticker)</p><p><strong>Supported by: </strong>Particl Foundation (Swiss Foundation)</p><p><strong>Total supply:</strong> 8,634,140 PARTs</p><p><strong>Particl Foundation ownership:</strong> 513,502 PARTs (6%)</p><p><strong>First funding round contributors ownership:</strong> 7,124,638 PARTs (82.5%)</p><p><strong>Funds time-locked for 2nd funding round:</strong> 996,000 (11.5%)</p><p><strong>Network consensus:</strong> Proof-of-stake (PoSv3)</p><p><strong>Block time:</strong> 120 sec</p><p><strong>Block size: </strong>~2mb</p><p><strong>Inflation:</strong> 5% year 1, 4% year 2, 3% year 3, 2% year 4+</p><p><strong>Available on: </strong>Windows, OSX, Linux and ARM (Raspberry PI, BeagleBone Black, etc)</p><h2 id=\"bitcoin-codebase\">Bitcoin Codebase</h2><p>Particl is a privacy platform using its own native currency, PART. It is built on top of the latest Bitcoin codebase (0.14.2) on which the dev team <strong>added as much as 100,000 new lines of code</strong> (as of the time of this publication) to turn it into a completely unique coin filled with a ton of cool features. Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency to ever exist, it is the coin that everyone knows how to work with and also the most battle tested blockchain. For these reasons, it could easily be argued that Bitcoin has the safest codebase on which to build on top of.</p><p>Some other features inherited from the current Bitcoin codebase version include (but is not limited to) <strong>HD wallets, multi-sig addresses</strong> (fully integrated into graphical wallet),<strong> block pruning</strong> (saves quite a lot of disk space after the chain is fully synced),<strong> fast syncing, easy tor setup, watch-only wallet support, libsecp256k1 signing and signature validation, direct headers announcement, notifications through ZMQ, compact block support and ARM builds.</strong> You can read this article to get more information on these features: <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-core-0140-released-whats-new/\">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-core-0140-released-whats-new/</a></p><h2 id=\"dual-token-system\">Dual Token System</h2><p>Why should we have to choose between privacy and convenience when we can have both on the same chain? This is the premise behind one of the major changes the team has made to the Bitcoin codebase: a dual token system. Particl uses two different tokens that can seamlessly be transferred for one another. One of these is a public token, which carries the <strong>same pseudo-anonymity characteristics as Bitcoin</strong>, while the second one is a <strong>completely anonymous and private coin</strong>. Users can easily send public coins into private balances, and the wallet automatically converts the public coin into a private coin. The same can be done if a user sends a private coin into a public address. Sending a private token to a private address successfully “mixes” your coins and allows you to maintain top-of-the-line privacy. Note that it will be very easy and effortless to do these conversions within the GUI wallet.</p><h3 id=\"public-token\">Public Token</h3><p>While Particl is mainly a privacy-focused project, the use of a public token (default token) is very important in terms of management, integration, and security. <br>One of the problems with exclusively anonymous currencies is that it can be hard to confirm the authenticity of the block creation process. What if an attacker had the key to generate an infinite amount of coins? What if no one noticed the hack until the attacker dumps large orders of fraudulently created coins on the trading market? These are very serious threats that are a reality with some of the 100% private coins. ZK SNARKS, for example, a crypto privacy protocol, also has this “hidden inflation problem”. In fact, the chain is initially generated from a set of master keys which could theoretically be used to generate an infinite amount of coins at any time without anyone ever noticing. This is why people say this protocol relies on “trusted setups”; you actually need to trust the party who spawned the chain would successfully destroy the master keys. There is, of course, no way to know for sure whether they didn’t keep copies somewhere or that they were not compromised during any step of the process (software, hardware, network, OS, BIOS, ME chip exploits). After all, cryptocurrencies are now worth a lot and they have become the primary target for hackers around the world.</p><p>It is precisely for these reasons that the Particl team opted for a fully transparent coin generation process. Because all newly generated coins are public, a hacker/bug would instantly be detected and measures could be taken to fix the problem.</p><p>Additionally, since the public token is built in a very similar way as Bitcoin, it is much easier for third-parties such as exchanges, websites, and wallets (Jaxx, Exodus, Ledger Wallet, etc.) to integrate. They do not need to go out of their way and spend many dev hours without knowing if it will be economically worth it to integrate that coin. The best example I could find concerning this, in particular, is the case of Monero and Jaxx. Jaxx is a well-known multi-cryptocurrency wallet and they tried to integrate Monero earlier this year. After trying to add the coin to their wallet, they announced they would finally not do it because it was too complicated and they didn’t feel the amount of dev time required for this project would be worth it. This would not happen with Particl as the BTC codebase is what everybody is used to working with and can integrate it without much effort.</p><p>This public token is also very useful for people who do not necessarily require a permanently anonymous experience. Fully-anonymous currencies can sometimes hinder one’s ability to effectively keep track of financial records and transactions. Some services ask for extra information (i.e. a payment ID for Monero) in order for a transaction to be accepted and there are many situations where one could forget to note that transaction ID down or lose it afterward. There’s also a lot of scenarios where one would need to go back several months into the past to see specific transaction details. In most cases, it is simply harder to keep track of things with fully private coins so having one that does possess great accountability tools is definitively a plus.</p><p>On top of this, a transaction using any privacy coin is generally going to cost more in fees than a public transaction on a non-bloated BTC codebase currency as it typically involves more data movement and computation. A “public user”, one that does not necessarily want to be anonymous, should not have to pay for privacy features he does not need. By making the public token the default coin, this ensures that only users seeking privacy options will use the privacy token, while the public users (which will probably end up being the majority of Particl users if the platform becomes mainstream) default to the public token. This also has the non-negligible effect of putting less stress on the network (as public transactions are more lightweight and do not fill blocks as much as private ones), keeping the network efficient.</p><h3 id=\"private-token\">Private Token</h3><p>Particl’s private token has a variable degree of privacy which can be adjusted by users according to their preferences. In fact, when making a private transaction, it is possible to send it using Confidential Transactions or RingCT (which is a blend of ring signatures and Confidential Transactions). It is noteworthy to mention that <strong>this is the first time both these protocols are being implemented on the Bitcoin codebase</strong>. While a few coins use Confidential Transactions as their privacy protocol, only one uses an implementation of RingCT on their main net: Monero.</p><p>Confidential Transactions, or CT, is a privacy protocol initially developed for Bitcoin that hides amounts sent from the public and makes it visible only to parties involved in the actual transaction. While it is very efficient to obfuscate most regular person-to-person transactions, its most interesting use case is when used in Particl’s marketplace decentralized escrow system. As a matter of fact, if the market’s escrow system worked using the public token, it would be trivial for determined attackers to detect patterns in the public escrow contracts and match them to potential users. On a long enough timeline, users could be identified with particular marketplace orders with a high degree of certainty. With the help of Confidential Transactions, this cuts off this attack vector and makes the escrow system fully anonymous. To learn more about CT, please consult this link: <a href=\"https://people.xiph.org/~greg/confidential_values.txt\">https://people.xiph.org/~greg/confidential_values.txt</a></p><p>RingCT, on the other side, is an even better privacy protocol combining ring signatures to the aforementioned confidential transaction protocol. Applied on double stealth addresses, not only transaction amounts are hidden but the sender and receiver addresses as well, making RingCT transactions completely untraceable. It should be taken into consideration that RingCT will not be available when Particl first launches, but will it be implemented soon enough. This feature is currently on testnet #3, but it still requires some work before it is incorporated into the main chain. The team also wants to have it fully audited by a third-party before going live with it.</p><p>One useful feature of the Particl wallet is that users are actually presented with the option to choose the privacy protocol they want to use according to their needs. CT is a good privacy protocol for basic privacy, but RingCT is even better as it makes transactions unlinkable. However, the latter is much more expensive in fees than the first one, and people who do not require a “paranoid” level of privacy may not want to pay larger fees.</p><p>In my subjective opinion, Particl will offer the best privacy experience on the market as it is very flexible but makes no compromise. RingCT is considered top-of-the-line technology and it simply works fantastically in preserving one’s privacy. Some could argue that ZK-SNARKS offers a better solution, and that is rightfully debatable. They do offer an interesting privacy solution, but they do have their share of problems and vulnerabilities as mentioned above. Centralized coin mixers are obviously not to be trusted as there is no way to know the legitimacy of the website owner, and coinjoin services are demonstrably weak and exploitable by determined adversaries.</p><p>The hidden inflation problem is also one of the reasons why I believe Particl, with its dual token system, has a “safer” (and easier to integrate) implementation of RingCT than Monero. Don’t get me wrong, there are good arguments people could make about Monero having the better integration. For example, RingCT being mandatory and by default on all transactions makes it impossible to make a basic human mistake (they do happen), but it also makes Monero a more expensive currency to use and a blockchain less likely to be able to support a huge influx of users (as transactions are heavy and would bloat the blockchain faster). This is the kind of debate where both sides have pros and cons, so I will let you make your own conclusion on this topic.</p><p>Also related to Particl’s privacy but not its private coin, it is possible to route the wallet’s connection through TOR in order to keep your node IP address private. This is absolutely needed if you want a secure staking setup (unless you used OpenVPN with solid network rules) as broadcasting the real IP address of a staking node to the world is asking for trouble.</p><h2 id=\"decentralized-anonymous-person-to-person-marketplace\">Decentralized &#x26; Anonymous Person-to-person Marketplace</h2><p>Quoted from <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf\">Particl’s whitepaper draft</a>: “<em>Satoshi Nakamoto, the visionary and creator of Bitcoin, originally intended that Bitcoin is paired with a marketplace, as evidenced by beginnings of a market framework included in early snapshots of the Bitcoin codebase. The market-related code was eventually stripped out, however, presumably as he decided to focus first on creating his world-changing currency. The concept of a decentralized marketplace in itself is not novel, there have been a small set of academic constructions and even serious attempts at creating them. They either propose solutions that scale extremely well and neglect the privacy implications, or they propose very privacy conscious solutions that do not scale well. Privacy and efficiency are often at odds with each other,” to hide the signal there must be noise”. Tor exemplifies this well, the traffic is pushed through various nodes with several layers of encryption before arriving at its destination, it is deliberately inefficient but the privacy provided by the</em><br><em>trade-off is well worth it”.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-9M6fKKTzuuy1DhCwp7jtGQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl Marketplace mock up posted during the fundraiser (Confirmed outdated, but gives a rough idea where the team is going visually speaking)</figcaption></figure><p>In development for about two years, the Particl marketplace strives to be the <strong>first</strong> decentralized marketplace to <strong>successfully nail scalability and full privacy at the same time</strong>. The team aspires to achieve this accomplishment by using the OMP market protocol they developed internally.</p><h3 id=\"open-market-protocol\">Open Market Protocol</h3><p>The Open Market Protocol, or OMP, is a <em>“standardized and open format that can encompass all the economic interactions of an online marketplace” (</em><a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/\"><em>https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/</em></a><em>#)</em>. The OMP is built with three main components in mind, namely extensibility, privacy, and market data portability. It can be adopted by anyone who wishes to build a decentralized market of some sort.</p><p>Its <em>extensibility</em> characteristic makes it much more resilient to new, more efficient technologies to come out. This aspect is explained in details in the Protocol-agnosticism section of this presentation.</p><p><em>Privacy</em> is also an important cornerstone of this protocol. <em>“Recent revelations and academic papers have proven beyond a doubt that there are many active threats to our digital privacy and security. Additionally, decentralized networks, as well as blockchains, are open public books full of sensitive information for passive attackers to abuse. This was of great concern when designing [the OMP] protocol as it could potentially put [its] users at risk”</em></p><p>Portability is the ability to easily move market data such as inventory, images and shipping details (among others) data between different markets. “<em>One of the many frustrations that online merchants and vendors suffer is the lack of portability of the inventory data between the many different online marketplaces. The more markets your products are available on, the greater their exposure and thus the greater their potential revenue streams. Yet importing the inventory data into another application or website remains a cumbersome process, often on purpose to prevent vendors from using competition” </em>By making market data standardized, it becomes very easy for vendors to open a shop on any marketplace using the OMP protocol and realize their full economic potential.</p><h3 id=\"decentralized-trust-less-escrow-system\">Decentralized &#x26; Trust-less Escrow System</h3><p>There are many challenges in designing a fully anonymous and decentralized marketplace. One of these is to ensure that neither the vendors nor the buyers get scammed by the other party. How do you make sure the vendor doesn’t simply take the money and not ship the product? How do you make sure the buyer actually pays for a shipped product? In most cases, typical marketplaces such as Alibaba, eBay or Amazon use what is called an escrow system. The platform acts as a middle-man and receives the payment of a product or service on behalf of the vendor and holds on to it until the buyer confirms he has received the product. Should problems arise, the escrow agent will usually take the role of a mediator and decide what happens to the escrowed funds (it will either be a refund for the buyer or a release of funds to the vendor).</p><p>Since the Particl marketplace aims to be entirely trustless, it cannot use escrow agents as that constitutes centralization. An agent could be wrong on a decision, go rogue, collude with a party, and above all, <strong>they always charge a fee</strong>. No escrow agent will work for free.</p><p>The Particl team developed what they call the MAD escrow system. This trust-less and free service is based on the Mutually Assisted Destruction game theory. As defined on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction\">Wikipedia</a>, Mutual assured destruction (or mutual assisted destruction) “is a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides would cause the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender. It is based on the theory of deterrence, which holds that the threat of using strong weapons against the enemy prevents the enemy’s use of those same weapons. The strategy is a form of Nash equilibrium in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to initiate a conflict or to disarm”.</p><p>In the context of an escrow system, it simply means that the escrow is designed in such a way that it financially punishes both parties if one of them behaves badly. The MAD escrow works by requiring the buyer to deposit twice the amount of the desired product in a 2-of-2 multisig escrow address, while the vendor has to deposit the full value of the item he is selling as insurance. Both parties need to sign the release of the funds before a set time for the deal to conclude, otherwise, the escrow busts and funds are sent over to the stakers.</p><p>For example, if you were selling a 500$ TV to a user, you would have to fund the MAD escrow with 500$ and your buyer would need to fund it with 1,000$ (500$ item value + 100% insurance deposit of 500$). The document section of the shadowproject.io website explains in an understandable fashion how the psychology behind MAD escrow works:</p><p>From <a href=\"https://doc.shadowproject.io/#mutual-assured-destruction-mad\">ShadowProject’s documentation page</a>: <em>“If the buyer receives the item and decides not to finalize the transaction then the address becomes unspendable after the expiration date and neither party gets their insurance deposit back. The buyer will have effectively paid twice the price but the vendor loses his insurance deposit and the item. [If] the vendor does not to ship the item, [it] leaves the buyer with the option to finalize the transaction or not: finalizing the transaction causes him to minimalize his losses to one time the price of the item and the vendor makes a profit of one time the item price. If the buyer decides not to finalize the transaction he loses twice the amount of the item price but also causes the vendor to lose his insurance deposit. The buyer is to some extent at a disadvantage and motivated to finalize the transaction to minimize his losses in case of a vendor scam. Both the buyer and the vendor will be motivated to extend the escrow transaction and work towards a refund agreement that both parties are willing to sign.”</em></p><p>Of course, this MAD escrow system is flexible. If a problem arises during a transaction, both parties can agree to either extend the escrow deadline time or proceed with partial refunds. It is also entirely up to the users to decide what insurance deposit percentage they want to use. A vendor and a buyer could agree for a 25% insurance deposit, meaning that for a 500$ TV purchase, a vendor would need to deposit 125$ into the escrow while the buyer would need to deposit 625$ (500$ + 25% insurance deposit of 125$).</p><h3 id=\"self-governance\">Self-Governance</h3><p>Another of the big challenges in designing a decentralized and anonymous market is trying to reduce the irresponsible and criminal use of the platform as much as possible. Since it is censorship-resistant, no central authority can delete its content and so it could easily be abused by criminals, spammers, and trolls. This would end up making the platform look much less appealing to the regular honest user and enable undesirable activities.</p><p>Particl’s solution to this problem is a self-governance system where users can flag undesirable content. At this moment, it is not confirmed whether a listing considered undesirable is completely taken out of the market or if it puts it in an NSFW kind of state where users can decide whether they want that type of content to be displayed or not (similar to how OpenBazaar does it). The method of governance is also not confirmed, but if we are to speculate, it could possibly be tied to staking like Particl’s voting system works (will be explained later in this document).</p><h3 id=\"private-listings\">Private Listings</h3><p>As mentioned just above, there is a self-governance in place preventing the platform from essentially becoming a decentralized version of the infamous Silkroad marketplace. There is, however, a form of listing which cannot be flagged by the community: private listings. These listings do not appear on the public marketplace and are hidden even from the blockchain itself as they are fully encrypted. Only a vendor and a user possessing a specific link to the listing can have access to its content, making it a very interesting use-case for alternative markets as anyone could simply run a website making external references to these private listings, fundamentally creating the perfect semblance of a 100% anonymous and censorship-proof (even from Particl’s self-governance system) marketplace that cannot get hacked, be busted or exit scam their users.</p><h3 id=\"fighting-spam\">Fighting Spam</h3><p>As mentioned above, spammers are another major concern on popular blockchain platforms. In the crypto world, there are many reasons why one would want to mount a spam attack on a chain. It could be because that entity wants to short the coin on trading markets, or because he has invested in a competing platform that is seeking to destroy the reputation of Particl.</p><p>Fighting spam attacks will always remain an ongoing battle as spammers will always try to find new ways to make themselves an annoyance, and the Particl team plans on keeping the platform spam-free a priority. On market release, the platform will already be armed with two spam-fighting features other than the self-governance flagging system.</p><p>The first one of these measures is to make listings stay up for a maximum of 48 hours. That means a spammer has to constantly keep the attack up otherwise it will not have any long-term damage to the platform. This also helps the market be much more scalable as it only requires to have two days worth of listings. The second measure is the implementation of a very small listing fee (initially 0.01 PART, can be adjusted and ultimately made dynamic) making a sustained attack quite costly for an attacker. While the fees are quite small, mounting a considerably effective spam attack would require large amounts of funds to be paid to the market every two days.</p><p>As will be explained further down this presentation, market fees actually go to the stakers (people who run nodes that secure the network), which brings an interesting dynamic…<strong>Any spammer that wants to heavily spam the Particl marketplace inevitably ends up sending his money to the very community he is trying to bring down!</strong></p><h3 id=\"going-mainstream\">Going Mainstream</h3><p>The project doesn’t hide the fact that it wishes to become the first decentralized marketplace to become used in the multi-billion “mainstream” world of commerce. This is why user-friendliness and usability are at the core of the team’s strategy. The ultimate goal is to make the cryptocurrency side of things all in the background so that even your grandmother could intuitively use it.</p><p>Another mainstream-appealing feature the team is working on is the integration of many in-client fiat gateways from which one could fund his Particl wallet. Some solutions being explored at the moment would allow users to use bank transfers, credit cards, and Localbitcoin-style services. Note, however, that neither the Particl developing team nor the Particl Foundation are licensed financial organizations, therefore this implementation most certainly would be the result of partnerships with other services (i.e. Changelly, Tether, etc.). It would be very surprising if fiat gateways were part of the initial release of the wallet.</p><h3 id=\"low-fees\">Low Fees</h3><p>One great thing about the Particl marketplace is its relatively low prices compared to centralized competitors. In fact, selling on websites such as Amazon or Alibaba is great because they bring vendors a lot of users, but they also charge a huge premium just so their user base can be leveraged. After all, it is generally Amazon/Alibaba/eBay that brings a company new customers, not the other way around, so that premium fee is the price to pay to get new customers from these big e-commerce platforms.</p><p>Let’s take Alibaba, for example. It is one of the most valued e-commerce websites on the internet and has a huge user base of both buyers, merchants, service providers and suppliers. If you wanted to start selling products on it, you would probably want to get a gold membership so you don’t get absolutely buried in the thousands of listing and so that you at least have a minimum set of features you could use. Their gold membership is subscription based and according to Harry Peterson, a professional in China sourcing and B2B (business-to-business) marketing, businesses located in mainland China need to pay almost up to $5,000 USD a year just to get their membership. Businesses outside China mainland have variable subscription fees based on which jurisdiction they are doing business from, but it is estimated that an average subscription amounts to around $2,999 USD a year (<a href=\"https://www.quora.com/How-much-does-it-cost-to-sell-on-Alibaba\">https://www.quora.com/How-much-does-it-cost-to-sell-on-Alibaba</a>). On the Alibaba website itself, subscription fees seem to be even higher, now priced at $5,999 USD a year for the full package (<a href=\"http://seller.alibaba.com/memberships/index.html\">http://seller.alibaba.com/memberships/index.html</a>).</p><p>Of course, there are various packages and these fees are somewhat flexible, but that gives you an idea what a gold membership costs if you want to use Alibaba as a platform and get the whole set of features that will allow you to leverage the full capacity of what the platform has to offer. Don’t forget that on top of these memberships, Alibaba charges a whopping 5% fee on any transactions done through its escrow system, as it is centralized and requires staff to manage. All these fees, end up being costly for both buyers and sellers. Remember that Particl’s MAD (mutually assisted destruction) escrow system is absolutely free of charge as it is entirely decentralized and managed by both the buyer and the vendor.</p><p>Amazon, on the other hand, chooses a different fee schedule to make its money by applying two types of fees. The first one is a generic “per-item” selling fee. You can choose two plans: the individual plan, which charges $0.99 USD per items sold, or a professional plan, which is a subscription of $39,99 USD per month (<a href=\"https://services.amazon.com/selling/pricing.htm\">https://services.amazon.com/selling/pricing.htm</a>).</p><p>On top of that, it also charges what is called a “referral fee” which is a percentage of your item’s value that Amazon keeps for itself. This fee ranges from 6% to an almost insulting 25% depending on the item’s category. Some Amazon-branded items can even go up to 45%. Please visit this detailed article to know the exact fee schedule Amazon uses: <a href=\"http://www.cpcstrategy.com/blog/2014/06/sell-on-amazon-pricing/\">http://www.cpcstrategy.com/blog/2014/06/sell-on-amazon-pricing/</a>. There is also another type of fee which Amazon can charge, but that only applies if you want Amazon to fulfill your order (meaning you send your inventory to Amazon and they do the processing, storage, and shipping for you). These fees are all indicated in the CPC strategy article I linked just above.</p><p>What about eBay? While listing an item isn’t really that expensive, your first 50 listings of each month being free and the subsequent being $0.30 USD, the website still charges you a non-negligible 10% “final value fee” (the final value is calculated AFTER shipping fees are applied) with a maximum of $750 USD per transaction. You can visit this link which details all the listings (plus some advanced feature fees I will not go into): <a href=\"http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/fees.html\">http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/fees.html</a></p><p>Etsy? Well, it is admittedly much cheaper, but still considerably more expensive than Particl. They charge $0.20 USD per listing posted and then apply a “transaction fee” of 3.5% (which isn’t applied to shipping cost as well if you are selling either from the USA or Canada but is applied otherwise). There are also various other fees if you wish to use more advanced features such as Etsy’s “Direct Checkout”. For their fee schedule, please visit this link here: <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/legal/fees/\">https://www.etsy.com/legal/fees/</a>.</p><p>As it is probably obvious by now, these platforms charge their users HUGE premiums, which is kind of understandable since they are critical to the success of a good number of these vendors. Particl is going to be a much, much cheaper option for vendors, regardless if they are big or small. It will also greatly benefit buyers by basically charging them no fees at all except low cryptocurrency transaction fees (listing fees are paid for by vendors). Vendors will only need to pay 0.01 PART per listing renewed every two days. This fee is likely to be made dynamic so that it goes down when PART’s price goes up and vice versa.</p><h3 id=\"target-users\">Target Users</h3><p>Going for the mainstream world of e-commerce certainly is a huge ambition. It is true that a decentralized system is likely to be less efficient than its centralized counterparts, but it does also offer services that giants like eBay, Amazon or Alibaba simply cannot provide to their customers: privacy and censorship-resistance. So who, exactly, would end up using a potentially less efficient but more private platform than well-established e-commerce Goliaths?</p><p>During the time of the initial funding round, I’ve <a href=\"https://decentralize.today/who-is-going-to-use-particls-decentralized-anonymous-market-and-why-is-it-so-badly-needed-7eb79cc8b9ad\">written a lengthy article </a>going over exactly this question. Here’s a tl;dr list of potential early users:</p><p>- Controversial &#x26; potentially illegal goods &#x26; services <br>- Perceived gray area businesses<br>- Unfairly blocked businesses<br>- People looking for better protection of personal/corporate data &#x26; documents<br>- Taxation resistance &#x26; revolts<br>- People from the unbanked world where banks and e-commerce websites are not present<br>- Much lower fees than centralized counterparts<br>- Any crypto user looking to shop with his favorite coin</p><p>This article only lists what I could think of at the time, but the potential of a decentralized marketplace and escrow system is huge and there are some use-cases one could not think of until someone actually comes out with it. A potential use case not featured in my previous article which became apparent to me since is the use of Particl marketplace’s escrow system for OTC exchange of unreleased ICO coin accounts (trading coins before their chain is released). This seems to be an increasingly popular practice within the crypto world, with most vendors/buyers doing these trades on Slack/Reddit.</p><h3 id=\"currency-agnosticism\">Currency-Agnosticism</h3><p>By definition, “an agnostic person is one who believes it is impossible to know anything about God or about the creation of the universe and refrains from commitment to any religious doctrine”. In our context, the platform is considered “agnostic” because its developing team does not believe its native coin should be created with a “one coin to rule them all” mentality and thus should have a platform that can work with as many cryptocurrencies as possible. As we do not know what coins will be the most used in 5 years, let alone in a month, it is safe and forward-thinking to make the platform be ready to work with them at any time.</p><p>This feature will mostly be used for the Particl marketplace Dapp, as it will allow people to shop online using their favorite cryptocurrency without ever leaving the wallet or having to manually trade their coins prior to purchasing a product. While it may seem like that would reduce Particl’s potential valuation as that would generate less demand for its native coin, it actually does not. Because the market’s decentralized escrow is a 2 of 2 multi-sig CT PART address,<strong> it requires any non-PART purchases to be traded (automatically done by the wallet) for PART to operate.</strong> Vendors do not even need to state what coins they want to accept, as they all get paid in PART. They are then free to Shapeshift back to any coin they want, again without ever leaving the wallet.</p><p>This currency-agnosticism actually brings a lot of value to the platform’s native coin. For one, any order made on the market, whether it is paid using PART, BTC, ETH or any compatible currency, ends up being a buy order for PART. This feature also brings a non-speculative use case for all compatible currencies, as the holders of those coins can now shop online with them and not simply hold them for speculative reasons. This has the potential to end up putting a lot of buy pressure on the PART coin.</p><h3 id=\"shapeshift-integration\">Shapeshift Integration</h3><p>This ability to seamlessly shop with any coin is powered by Shapeshift. That means that any coin available on their platform can be used to shop on Particl. Some of the use cases I personally find interesting is the use of the DGX token (gold-backed cryptocurrency, not yet available on Shapeshift though…) and USDt (fiat USD-backed cryptocurrency) to seamlessly shop with coins that are backed by real assets. Gold bugs will immediately understand why this is a big deal, but let’s pause for a moment and appreciate what opportunity it presents. When was the last time people could just go out and shop using actual gold coins? The way it is designed, the vendor does not even have to “accept” the currency on his store, and you can send tiny fractions of that gold coin (which is obviously impossible with physical bullion). This could become a really big use case for Particl if the world economy ends up crashing and people abandon fiat for value-based assets such as gold. This could even initiate a paradigm shift in how people conduct commerce around the world.</p><p>Note, however, that this Shapeshift integration is a temporary solution as the team plans on designing its own fully decentralized and trust-less currency exchange system. This is due for much later though, and I believe that for the time being Shapeshift will be more than satisfying as an option.</p><h3 id=\"protocol-agnosticism\">Protocol-Agnosticism</h3><p>In this context, being protocol agnostic refers to the fact that the Particl platform does not limit itself to one decentralized data storage protocol, but rather makes it extensible and easy to <strong>integrate various different protocols at the same time, and let the user choose which one he prefers using</strong>. As Kewde, a Particl developer, elegantly puts it on his Open Market Protocol GitBook: <em>“Technology moves at an exponential rate, and the very few protocols that survive the test of time are all designed with extensibility in mind. A protocol looking to be relevant on a long enough timeline should be both robust and flexible enough that it easily allows any developer to securely expand it. The development of decentralized storage networks (DHTs, BitTorrent, IPFS) and blockchain solutions is still young, there aren’t any clear “winners” that meet all criteria nor may there ever be, thus the protocol must accommodate for it”.</em></p><p>To illustrate why this is a good concept, let’s say Particl only uses its native SMSG protocol to run its marketplace on. That would work fine…until the marketplace gets very popular and cannot scale anymore because there are too many people using it. On a protocol-agnostic platform, it would be very easy to simply add a new, more scalable protocol to support the flock of new users, but if it wasn’t designed with extensibility in mind, it would be stuck with a technology that cannot support its own popularity. In most cases, the platform would either be abandoned by its users, require some kind of fork (which is risky), or the developing team would abandon the project and start a new one with better technology.</p><p>In other words, <strong>Particl is designed in such a way that it embraces new protocols instead of being rendered obsolete by them</strong>, and it does so without ever requiring a fork of some kind.</p><h3 id=\"decentralized-network-storage\">Decentralized Network Storage</h3><p>Decentralized storage networks, or DSNs, are decentralized extensions “plugged” into the Particl protocol to help it store data in a decentralized and off-chain fashion. They are what I referred to as “new protocols” in the last section. The use of DSNs is essential as the Particl platform does not store its marketplace data on the blockchain itself as that would quickly bloat it and make everything much more inefficient. Here is an excerpt from Particl’s whitepaper draft: <br> <br> <em>“The Data Storage Network (DSN) is tasked with storing market listings as well as messages between sender and receiver and all other accompanying data (such as but not limited to images and videos). Sensu stricto the market listing references, stored in the blockchain, are also protocol-agnostic, simply meaning it can handle different DSN protocols such as BitMessage, IPFS, HTTPS…”</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-FuY-KpehaQSXH8Bf7634_Q.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of DSNs that could be integrated into Particl:</p><p>- HTTPs (Privacy:- ( — )<br>- TOR (Privacy: + + )<br>- SMSG (Privacy: + + + )<br>- * IPFS (Privacy: + )<br>- * Siacoin (Privacy: + )<br>- * Storj (Privacy: + )<br>- * SafeNetwork (Privacy: + + + )</p><p>* This DSN hasn’t been integrated yet or is not production-ready.</p><p>As there isn’t really a “best” solution, the Particl platform lets users choose which decentralized storage network they want to use. Some DSNs provide great anonymity characteristics but don’t scale as well as others (such as is the case with SMSG). Some provide great scaling capabilities but are more expensive to use. There is also the fact that some of these DSNs required a native token transfer (Sia, Storj, SafeNetwork), making the integration trickier (but still possible) and possibly less interesting for users. Don’t forget that these DSNs which use a native token either charge the uploader of content or the downloader depending on what storage network is being used.</p><p>While DSNs are mostly used by the marketplace application (and the messaging system in the case of SMSG), the agnostic and extensible design has been standardized by the team so that it can be easily deployed whenever the platform needs to interact with third-party software, once again ensuring that it never gets outpaced by new technologies but embraces them instead. It also has the potential to add use-cases to other blockchain projects (for example, providing a complete and decentralized merchant and escrow system to Siacoin).</p><h2 id=\"proof-of-stake-consensus-algorithm\">Proof-of-stake Consensus Algorithm</h2><p>From <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake\">Wikipedia’s proof-of-stake page</a>,<em> “Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a type of algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus. Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) based cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin), where the algorithm rewards participants who solve complicated cryptographical puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining), in PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen in a deterministic (pseudo-random) way, and the chance that an account is chosen depends on its wealth (i.e. the stake)”.</em> Paid at every block, PoS basically financially rewards users for securing the network. It is also much easier to start staking than it is to start mining (as you need to buy a lot of equipment and do some research to understand how it all works), so it could be argued that PoS is a more decentralized and “people-friendly” decentralized consensus algorithm, only requiring users to buy coins, deposit them on their wallet and let it open as often as possible.</p><p>Particl uses a pretty recent version of PoS named PoSv3, and has a variable inflation rate that goes as follow:</p><p>Year 1: 5%<br>Year 2: 4% <br>Year 3: 3%<br>Year 4+: 2%</p><h3 id=\"staking-as-an-investment\">Staking As an Investment</h3><p>Particl’s inflation calendar has been designed this way to support the price during the adoption period by making it quite profitable to stake. Once the marketplace application is more popular and as staking rewards reduce over time, the “burden” of price support should organically transfer from speculators to marketplace users.</p><p>One thing that is important to understand about staking rewards is that you are guaranteed to get a 5% interest profit in the first year <strong>if 100% of the network’s coins are staking. </strong>Staking becomes increasingly more profitable as less and less people stake. This is a direct incentive to get as many nodes staking as possible. However, it is highly unrealistic to think the entire network would be staking as evidenced by Shadowcash’s historical statistics; the percentage of SDCs staking used to oscillate between 35%-50% of the entire network. On Particl, if 50% of the network was to stake their coins, that would mean you could expect an estimated 10% yield on your first year (if you let your wallet open 24/7).</p><p>Another interesting dynamic resulting from the way PoS was implemented is that market fees are paid directly to stakers. As explained earlier, the marketplace asks for a small 0.01 PART listing fee every 48 hours to fight spam. That means that as the market gets more activity, <strong>it becomes even more profitable</strong> for stakers. If it gets popular enough, it could completely nullify the effect of the decreasing inflation rate on staking rewards and possibly even making them bigger in the end. Other fees paid to stakers include regular transaction, CT and RingCT fees. Note that as the platform gets more Dapps other than the marketplace, the fees they generate would generally be sent to stakers.</p><p>Could there even be more financial incentives to stake? Yes, there is! As explained earlier, MAD escrows have a timer that forces both participating parties to release the funds before it runs out. This timer can, of course, be extended if both parties agree to, but what if it is not and the escrow runs out of time? All the funds are added to the staking rewards, which in some cases could amount to pretty big bonus rewards!</p><h3 id=\"staking-as-aparticl-foundation-self-funding-strategy\">Staking As aParticl Foundation Self-Funding Strategy</h3><p>When calculating potential staking rewards, it is important to deduct 10% from the final number. Why? The Particl Foundation didn’t want to simply rely on two funding rounds as they have a very long-term vision for the project, so they had to find a way to get constant funding. A solution they found was to take 10% of daily staking rewards and use those coins to fund the project (hire devs, launch marketing/PR campaigns, etc.). If you are familiar with the DASH project, they were the first ones to adopt such a strategy and it could be argued that it is one of the reasons they are doing so well right now.</p><h3 id=\"economic-dynamics-of-staking\">Economic Dynamics of Staking</h3><p>Since it has been first implemented, proof-of-stake has been observed to propose a different set of economic dynamics than proof-of-work. The major reason why this is so is that stakers don’t actually need to sell their stakes like miners who need to pay for various expenses (electricity, maintenance, temperature management, etc.).</p><p>In fact, if one was to analyze PoS blockchains, he would notice that most staking nodes actually hoard staking rewards rather than cash them out. Since there is no expense tied to staking, it is actually much more beneficial to re-invest (stake) your new rewards as that increasingly makes it more profitable as time goes by, a concept named compounded interest.</p><p>“Compound interest (or compounding interest) is interest calculated on the initial principal and also on the accumulated interest of previous periods of a deposit or loan. Thought to have originated in 17th-century Italy, compound interest can be thought of as “interest on interest,” and will make a sum grow at a faster rate than simple interest, which is calculated only on the principal amount. The rate at which compound interest accrues depends on the frequency of compounding; the higher the number of compounding periods, the greater the compound interest. Thus, the amount of compound interest accrued on $100 compounded at 10% annually will be lower than that on $100 compounded at 5% semi-annually over the same time period.” (<a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp\">http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp</a>)</p><p>For example, at a 5% reward rate, a staker having 1,000 PARTs would end up the year with 1,050 PARTs. On the second year, his 1,050 PARTs would increase by 4%, leaving the staker with 1092 PARTs. Another staker decides to sell his stake as he receives them, so on the first year, he would have made 50 PARTs of profits. However, because he decided to sell his stakes as he receives them, his second year of staking would only yield him 40 PARTs (1,000 * 0.04). Comparing these two stakers, the first one made a 92 PARTs profits while the second one made 90 PARTs. Note, however, that this example has been simplified for the sake of this presentation. In reality, staking rewards are paid at every block, not every year, so this “build-up” effect that causes stakers to get more PARTs rewards as they re-invest actually happens more quickly, making it even more profitable than in this example.</p><p>I’ve made a simple Calc file that allows you to easily calculate your staking rewards depending on the number of market listings, the estimated yearly return rate, and your PART balance. It takes compounded interest into consideration. Please follow this link to download and play with it: <a href=\"http://onlyo.co/2uQdLoM\">http://onlyo.co/2uQdLoM</a></p><p>Another interesting economic dynamic proof-of-stake provides is that it generates a coin supply shock on trading markets.</p><p>There are two main reasons for this. The first one, as explained above, is that stakers demonstrably prefer hoarding over spending their rewards, creating much less selling pressure on markets. Generally, this would make the coin’s price higher as the supply is reduced while demand stays unaffected. The second reason is directly related to the potential gains a staker can make by simply leaving his computer open. Some people would rather not risk trading their assets, so getting a solid 5–10% investment return under a year can be very appealing, making the coin more in demand. Taking both these dynamics into consideration, it could be said that proof-of-stake increases demand while reducing supply, which generally makes the coin more valuable.</p><p>One problem with that, though, is that if not enough people want to sell the currency on the markets (and simply hoard it instead), it can create a kind of liquidity crisis where not enough coins are put for sale. This is far from ideal for speculators with large sums of money who wouldn’t want to <strong>accumulate</strong> coins on an illiquid market as making a large order could dramatically increase the coin’s price. It is also not a very good marketplace currency as you want to easily be able to buy it at a relatively stable price. To understand why simply ask yourself if it makes sense to have the price increase by 10% just because you made a large PART order to buy a 10,000 USD car on its market. This is not sustainable, so what would be the best way to have a healthy and profitable balance between supply and demand?</p><h3 id=\"currency-agnosticism-proof-of-stake-combo\">Currency-Agnosticism &#x26; Proof-of-stake Combo</h3><p>I believe Particl already has a working solution implemented to balance its staking dynamics with Shapeshift. Remember how I said the market is currency-agnostic and uses Shapeshift to seamlessly exchange other coins into PARTs? Well, it’s not just the marketplace itself, but the entire Particl platform that is so, making it very easy and tempting to actually diversify your portfolio by shape shifting your rewards into other coins. Even though it can be historically demonstrated that stakers would rather keep their rewards than selling them, a proof-of-stake consensus protocol has never been implemented on a currency-agnostic platform.</p><p>Everybody says it: diversification is the key to a profitable and healthy portfolio and staying in only one currency is actually pretty risky. What an easy Shapeshift withdrawal option provides is the ability to very easily diversify your rewards. That means you could instantly convert PART rewards into available coins, be it BTC, ETH, DGX (100% gold-backed cryptocurrency, likely to be added to Shapeshift soon) or even USDt (USD-backed cryptocurrency). The concept of being able to be rewarded in any currency of your choice is actually quite novel and powerful, so it could be reasonably expected that this function will be used a lot.</p><p>For example, I know that I will personally keep around 50% of my own staking rewards in PARTs and shapeshift the rest into whatever currency I like at a given time. I’m surely not the only one who will use the Shapeshift integration this way…This would make the balance between supply and demand more healthy and has the added benefit of making stakers’ portfolios much more secure through diversification. Just pick a couple of coins you like and increase your bags every day!</p><h3 id=\"decentralized-voting-chain-governance\">Decentralized Voting &#x26; Chain Governance</h3><p>Most cryptocurrencies are designed with full immutability in mind, meaning their state (blockchain data &#x26; code) cannot be modified after it is launched (or spent, in the case of a transaction). However, recent events in crypto have shown us that a fully immutable approach to a blockchain perhaps isn’t optimal. In fact, if you are reading this presentation, chances are that you are aware of both the BTC <strong>scalability debate deadlock</strong> and the past split of the Ethereum chain (ETH &#x26; ETC) caused by a <strong>contentious hardfork.</strong></p><p>In the first case, Bitcoin requires finding a solution to help it scale better in order to allow for more transactions per second. There are two popular solutions to fix scalability, one that requires a change to the coin’s protocol (blocksize increase) and one that doesn’t (Segwit implementation). To make things worse, their community is actually split into several groups, mainly the community (traders, holders), devs (Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Unlimited) and miners. All these groups have their own motives and interests, and that makes coming to a middle-ground and making a decision all can agree to extremely hard. Also, because Segwit only requires miners to signal for it, it could be argued that the actual trading/holding community doesn’t have much weight in this whole debate as they can have only a very minimal impact on the signaling.</p><p>In the second case, Ethereum community was faced with a tough decision last year when their The DAO smart-contract got hacked and somebody was draining all funds from it. They had the choice to either let the attacker get away with all the funds, or make a modification to the “The DAO” contract that would have blocked the attack and refunded everyone. The second option, however, required a hardfork and it ended up being quite contentious, causing a chain split (Ethereum and Ethereum Classic). Furthermore, the polling method the Ethereum Foundation chose to use was a bit confusing. They first proposed a “Carbon Vote”, which was a method they quickly implemented to allow people to vote based on the number of coins they were holding. After much criticism, notably from the mining community, they then opted to adopt a more classic method of polling in crypto which is based on miner’s hashing rate (actually almost identical to how Bitcoin is polling its community to implement Segwit or not).</p><p>We can easily see the main issues with how both scenarios dealt with/are dealing with critical decisions. First, simply relying on miner signaling probably isn’t entirely fair to the rest of the community who doesn’t mine. It is true that anyone can use his computer to mine on whatever pool they want based on what decision the pool is taking (what is it signaling for), but not anyone has the knowledge or gear to do it, and whether this can rival the mining farm’s massive hashing rates is arguable. Also, even though the Ethereum Foundation says it also took the Carbon Vote in consideration when deciding to go for the hardfork, there were a lot of complaints from people saying they actually never heard of it. After all, only a very tiny percentage of the network went ahead and voted, so perhaps it was too complicated for most people or that the word didn’t spread fast and far enough. What makes it worse is that the voting was based on how many coins you were holding, basically making it a 1 coin = 1 vote. While that is not a bad thing in itself, it is relatively easy to game for anyone with deep pockets. An entity with a lot of money could have bought a large sum of coins, put them up for voting, and then dumped them once it’s said and done.</p><p>So with these lessons in mind, the Particl team decided to natively implement a voting system on its blockchain that can be used any time a tough decision needs to be taken by any party. Note, however, that this voting system isn’t only used to upgrade the protocol, it can be used by anybody for any reason. It could even be a vendor using the system to poll his customer base about what product they want to be added to the store, for example. They knew the system had to have a couple of key characteristics to be optimal, namely being as decentralized, cheap and limit abuse/fraud as much as possible. So how did they do it?</p><p>The Particl voting system is based on staking and is absolutely free. People wanting to vote on a particular matter need to first select their desired voting option and then make their wallet enabled for staking (which has the added benefit of further securing the network). Every time they stake a block, that will count as 1 vote. The entity who first sets up the vote parameters needs to specify to the community for how long the voting period will be open, specified in terms of block numbers (i.e. for a period of 2,500 blocks). This makes it harder to game as a large entity cannot simply buy, vote and dump instantly. They need to hold the coins for X number of blocks and actually secure the network doing so. Additionally, not only is it completely free to vote, it rewards voters with staking rewards, which definitively is an incentive to vote on stuff and not just hold the coins and go with the flow. The in-wallet integration (notably using widgets) also makes it very easy and user-friendly to participate. The only thing that requires a bit of research is that the voting content (description of the vote, pictures, graphs, etc.) will be done off-chain, most likely on Github at the beginning. Once IPFS or similar DSNs are implemented, it would then be trivial to also make the voting content in-wallet.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-BMvbHi93DbicQue6FOuGDw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>A CLI example of a user voting for option 2 on Proposal #5 from block 124 to 2,500</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-MRGH2pEBnZyaDl-CPbWGZA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>A staked block’s vote result (a staker voted for option 1 on proposal 10 at block #167)</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-6DVsuZ-OQtnA6M5E6YwdHg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl wallet showing voting results displayed in a GUI widget</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"decentralized-anonymous-encrypted-messaging-system\">Decentralized &#x26; Anonymous Encrypted Messaging System</h2><p>“<em>Communication is an essential component of doing business.

Nodes must try to decrypt all incoming messages to check if it was destined for them”.</em></p><p>As explained in the Particl whitepaper draft, <em>“A message traveling on the BitMessage network does not include metadata that can reveal who the receiver or sender is. Only the encrypted payload, IV, HMAC and temporary public key are public, the receiver of a message is the only able to decrypt the message and only for them the HMAC will properly verify.” </em>(<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf\">https://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf</a>)</p><p>While there is definitely some area of improvements the team is currently working on, notably concerning dual-key stealth addresses, future and forward secrecy, scalability, blockchain key distribution and RMIDs efficiency, this p2p messaging system offers a safe option for people looking to communicate and host market listings with the highest level of privacy possible.</p><h3 id=\"native-segwit-implementation\">Native Segwit Implementation</h3><p>Another sweet feature of the Particl blockchain is that it has a native implementation of Segwit, which I believe is a first in crypto. One small inconvenience with blockchain projects forking their chain to add Segwit is that witness blocks aren’t compatible with blocks prior to the fork. While this is not a critical problem, it sure makes things smoother and easier to have a fully compatible Segwit implementation.</p><p>Having segregated witness on Particl gives its blockchain a couple of interesting features. Among many of these, some notable ones are the <strong>Lightning Network</strong>, <strong>transaction malleability vulnerability fixes</strong>, and <strong>block capacity/size increase</strong>.<br> <br> Lightning Network is a payment channel protocol first proposed by Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja and now scheduled for implementation on Bitcoin as well as some altcoins. LN gives interesting features to whatever coin decides to implement it such as <strong>reduced transaction fees</strong>, <strong>increased transaction speed</strong>, better privacy, and <strong>atomic swaps.</strong></p><p>As it is becoming more and more likely as time goes by that the Lightning Network will be implemented in various different coins, its atomic swap feature is getting more relevant. Atomic swapping is the ability of an LN-enabled blockchain to be made inter-operable through <strong>multi-signature addresses</strong> and <strong>time-locks</strong> with many other LN-enabled blockchains in order to allow trust-less coin exchange between two parties (i.e. Alice can trade 100 LTC to Bob for 1 BTC in a 100% decentralized and counterparty-free fashion). This could even be used to create decentralized multi-coin payment processors or exchanges, effectively spawning a brand new and potentially breakthrough <strong>LN-focused ecosystem</strong> in which Particl could be part of. It also seems plausible that the Particl platform would eventually leverage this feature to allow trust-less currency exchange on its marketplace as well as other Dapps, effectively replacing Shapeshift with a cheaper and decentralized alternative, even though the team hasn’t made any statement on the matter.</p><h2 id=\"industry-leading-user-friendly-graphical-wallet\">Industry-leading &#x26; User-friendly Graphical Wallet</h2><p>All the aforementioned Particl features wouldn’t be as exciting if they weren’t supported by a user-friendly and eye-appealing wallet. Not everyone wants to use terminal-based wallets and even fewer people know how to. Fortunately, the Particl team has some of the best graphical designer and UI/UX devs in the crypto scene, as evidenced by their previous work on Shadowcash’s Umbra wallet built using HTML5.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-KttFKS_tel6YuhGReMv9kw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Graphical designed of SDC’s Umbra wallet, Particl’s prototype released in 2016</figcaption></figure><p>This time, the team has taken their GUI work to the next level! Started from scratch, the Particl wallet is built using the open-source project Electron (<a href=\"https://electron.atom.io/\">https://electron.atom.io/</a>) and AngularJS (<a href=\"https://angular.io/\">https://angular.io/</a>) as its main framework. The Particl wallet does away with the QtWebKit engine on which is created all the crypto Qt wallets to make it more <strong>secure, beautiful and flexible</strong>. At this stage of adoption, it is very important for a blockchain project eyeing the mainstream to have its platform as easy to use as possible. Indeed, Particl’s end-game is to make almost everything related to crypto work seamlessly in the background while offering users a very intuitive experience not more complicated than using web-based marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay, etc. A web portal (a website where one could use the Particl marketplace without even downloading the wallet and blockchain) is even planned for later, though the team is currently focusing on first releasing the market.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-D-85sM7GwLoHE2gNLuhoDg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl’s “Send” page</figcaption></figure><p>Security-wise, Electron offers substantial improvements over QtWebKit because of how rendered processes are sandboxed leveraging Chromium’s rendering engine. “A sandbox, in computer security, is a security mechanism in which a separate, restricted environment is created and in which certain functions are prohibited” (<a href=\"https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27682/sandbox-computer-security\">https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27682/sandbox-computer-security</a>). In Particl’s context, it means that if an attacker was to exploit a vulnerability within a Chromium rendered process, the damage would severely be limited to this very process and could not spread to other processes due to the engine’s sandbox.</p><p>On the aesthetics side, the interface is made much more appealing than the famous Qt engine. Written entirely in HTML, CSS, and Angular, it is much more interactive than any crypto wallet currently released and is designed with a “modular” approach to it. Indeed, the wallet supports the use of many widgets which can be selected by the user depending on what information they want to quickly be able to glance at. They display much useful information about the wallet in a neat visual fashion, and users can very easily customize how their wallet looks by adding/removing whatever widget they want. Elements they can display include (but are not limited to) staking data, voting data, transaction history, marketplace data, network data, etc. As they are basically only visual representation of blockchain/p2p data, it is very easy to add more of them. It will be interesting to see what the community comes up with in terms of useful widgets they can code and add to Particl. Also, as the project advances in time and new Particl Dapps are created, using widgets will lead to very different and personalized experiences from person to person depending on what is their main reason to use the Particl wallet (staking investment, shopping, holding, gambling on a Particl Dapp, etc.).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-DQmkHEn_IU0S5ymg4P1oug.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl wallet widgets overview &#x26; responsive capability</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-ukw96KJfPVy6VXrF6Yxuww.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl’s “Receive” page</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/In-Depth-Presentation-of-the-Particl-Project/1-git6mMXlfrz_Lb-dEi2Sgg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl’s “Settings” page</figcaption></figure><p>For more screenshots of the Particl wallet, you can either visit this link of GUI progress screenshots (<a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/AwNSX\">http://imgur.com/a/AwNSX</a>, posted on May 22nd, so may be outdated) or simply go ahead and participate in testnet #4 which is the first iteration of Particl testnet to include a GUI version.</p><h3 id=\"wallet-installer\">Wallet Installer</h3><p>Another useful feature the GUI wallet will have is an installer that automatically pops up the first time a user launches the wallet and offers to set up lots of stuff such as wallet file importation, privacy sliders (a user can choose how much privacy he needs to set up DSNs), tor installation, etc. Again, as the project grows, a lot can be added to the installer to make it even more useful and render the experience as user-friendly and customizable as possible.</p><h2 id=\"future-features\">Future Features</h2><p>Even though Particl will already offer quite an impressive set of features on day 1, the team has lots of goodies planned for the future.</p><p>One of them is a mobile wallet with ALL desktop features enabled, including messaging and marketplace shopping. The only aspect the team is not sure about integrating into its mobile wallet is staking since it has a couple of drawbacks (potentially high number of unstable nodes due to bad phone reception, battery draining, possible security vulnerabilities, etc.).</p><p>Fiat gateways are also high on the list of priorities. While a solid crypto marketplace could find its niche within the crypto world, it would be much more difficult to go mainstream if it didn’t support integrated fiat deposits and withdrawals. In a way, this is already covered through the Shapeshift integration using Tether (USDt), but more options are always appreciated. The team is considering partnerships with fiat gateways like Changelly which allows the use of credit cards as a funding method or using exchange API keys to integrate fiat pairs into the wallet.</p><p>Another future feature of the project is to establish web portals on which people can access some (or all) functions included in the desktop wallet. The end-game here is to allow people to shop on the marketplace using a website and without having to download the wallet and the entire blockchain. This would make it much easier for regular, non-crypto people to use and is one of the things that could greatly help Particl have a shot at becoming mainstream.</p><p>The team is also looking to integrate more DSNs through partnerships (Siacoin, SafeNetwork, IPFS, etc.) and others method of network routing such as i2p. This is of course with the goal to provide users with a vast array of choices to suit their security needs and budget (as DSNs can vary in pricing fees).</p><h2 id=\"competition\">Competition</h2><p>With all that being said, it is now time to look at who are Particl’s competitors. After all, the crypto world is now an extremely competitive space and it could lead to several BETA vs VHS or Blu-ray vs HD DVD situations where many projects would compete in the same sector until one becomes big enough to stomp its competitors out of business. Hopefully for Particl, it has one huge advantage in the fact that it actually competes in several sectors, dramatically increasing its exposure and chances of success. Please note that the following paragraphs will contain a lot of subjective opinions on why I believe Particl is a serious competitor in many industries, so take it with a grain of salt and come up with your own conclusions.</p><h3 id=\"as-a-currency\">As A Currency</h3><p>Particl definitely meets the criteria to be considered a competitor in the payment currency sector of crypto. Not only does it possess all the same features as Bitcoin and other similar currencies, it literally hosts a decentralized marketplace on its wallet on which its native currency is used to trade goods and services. This is a use-case that very few currencies can claim to have, but it doesn’t stop there.</p><p>Particl also directly competes in the field of privacy coins where Monero, Zcash (and similar ZK SNARKS coins) and DASH are furiously battling. Just as in the payment currency sector, Particl doesn’t need to shy away here at all. It does possess a similar (and <strong>arguably</strong> better) implementation of Monero’s privacy tech, RingCT, and even adds Lightning Network + CT on top of it for a very impressive privacy combo (<strong>RingCT + CT + LN combo</strong>). This should be very interesting for a lot of people and projects that wanted to easily add a RingCT coin to their platform (i.e. Jaxx wallet).</p><h3 id=\"as-a-marketplace\">As A Marketplace</h3><p>Another obvious crypto sector in which Particl is a serious competitor is with decentralized marketplaces. This space has a limited number of competitors such as OpenBazaar, Syscoin and Bitify. Personally, as an investor, my subjective opinion is that decentralized marketplaces are going to become a big thing in the years to come. This is why I research these projects a lot, and my conclusion is that Particl has the most potential to be adopted as a market through its user-friendliness and the many features detailed throughout this presentation. Its two main competitors, OpenBazaar and Syscoin, do have some interesting features but I believe they will not outperform Particl in terms of both popularity and investment returns. <br> <br> In the case of OpenBazaar, it is simply not possible to invest in it and while it charges no fee, its user experience is years away from any kind of mass adoption and has a p2p approach I am not too fond of. It also offers poor privacy and security parameters and should not be relied on by vendors looking for the ultimate privacy experience. What I find to be the most annoying thing about OB is that a vendor needs to host his shop on a computer/server and leave it open all the time. Failing that, the listing is put offline and the vendor cannot make any sale. It is possible to host your shop on a third-party server to make it more reliable in terms of uptime, but that is taking the control out of your hands and a security risk as well as going against the decentralization principle of the crypto world. OpenBazaar plans to launch a second version of their marketplace using IPFS which would allegedly eliminate the need to have a computer open at all time, but that does imply that they will need to introduce a fee structure to their platform.</p><p>With Syscoin, there are other problems that I see. The first one is that the user-experience is simply horrible and the wallet itself is not eye-appealing at all. Their solution for this was to create BlockMarket, a more user-friendly but <strong>closed-source</strong> interface interacting with the Syscoin blockchain. While it is definitely better looking than its Syscoin backend, it is still years away from any kind of mass adoption and its look would most likely turn off anyone that is not involved in crypto. What worries me the most about Blockmarket, however, is that it is basically a glorified centralized marketplace. In fact, The Blockchain Foundry (the company who developed BlockMarket) has total control over what content is hosted on its market. It can ban users and delete/censor listings at will, which leads me to wonder why one would even use the platform as it actually doesn’t provide much that centralized marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay don’t. It also doesn’t provide the set of privacy tools Particl offers, making it a no-go for any vendor looking for high levels of privacy. Also, purely from an investment, I believe Syscoin to not be as worth it as Particl because people can use other currencies on BlockMarket without having to touch Syscoin wat all. This is also the case with Particl, however, the latter automatically converts all other currencies into its native coin (PART) in order for a market order to be possible, so even though a user buys something with Bitcoin, it ends up being a Particl transaction, generating demand. It also should be noted that Particl is PoS while Syscoin is PoW, and I believe the proof-of-stake protocol is more fitted for a marketplace as it allows a lot of great features such as decentralized market governance and market fee earnings. Lastly, another problem I see with Syscoin is that should it become very popular, it would have some serious troubles with scalability as all market data are stored directly on-chain (contrary to Particl which stores data off-chain on DSNs).</p><p>Though it may seem that I am hating on the other projects, really I am not. I do believe this kind of industry can and will have enough place for more than one marketplace. After all, we have Etsy, eBay, Amazon, Craigslist and Alibaba all co-existing and sharing the same space, but with each one having its niche features and appeal to different audiences. There is nothing indicating that this could not be the case in the crypto world as well. Here, Particl definitely is the most secure and private solution, and this is what excites me the most as a privacy enthusiast.</p><p>We should also not forget about centralized, well-established marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay. These giants sure do have a huge share of the global market and have some really great features decentralized marketplace can probably not even dream of offering (at least for now), but they do have negatives that decentralized solutions can do better. Please refer to the previous “Target Users” section of this presentation, or read my previous article on this very subject by following this link: <a href=\"https://decentralize.today/who-is-going-to-use-particls-decentralized-anonymous-market-and-why-is-it-so-badly-needed-7eb79cc8b9ad\">https://decentralize.today/who-is-going-to-use-particls-decentralized-anonymous-market-and-why-is-it-so-badly-needed-7eb79cc8b9ad</a></p><p>I believe that decentralized marketplaces can compete with centralized ones in these aspects:</p><p>- Controversial &#x26; potentially illegal goods &#x26; services <br>- Perceived gray area businesses<br>- Unfairly blocked businesses<br>- People looking for better protection of personal/corporate data &#x26; documents<br>- Taxation resistance &#x26; revolts<br>- People from the unbanked world where banks and e-commerce websites are not present<br>- Much lower fees than centralized counterparts<br>- Any crypto user looking to shop with his favorite coin</p><h3 id=\"as-a-dapp-platform\">As A Dapp Platform</h3><p>Even though the competition with Dapp platforms such as Ethereum, Stratis, Lisk or Tezos in not as direct as Particl competition in the marketplace sector, it is still a platform on which more “Dapps” than the marketplace will be built. It is very important to understand that we are not talking about smart-contract Dapps here, but rather hard-coded decentralized applications. To give you an idea, a year or so ago, an SDC community member had started working on a dice Dapp that allowed people to gamble directly on the SDC wallet. The project was abandoned and the community member disappeared, but that gives a good idea of what kind of Dapps Particl could host. The use of DSNs open up a lot of possibilities, I wouldn’t be surprised if we ended getting decentralized Netflix/Youtube/Music Stores powered by DSNs such as IPFS or Siacoin.</p><p>The main difference with Ethereum in terms of Dapp is that Ethereum is more like an operating system similar to Linux where users are given full liberty to code any smart-contract with its native programming language (Solidity), whereas Particl is more like a WeChat-style application on which apps (not smart-contracts) can be added to. To get a better idea, Paul Schmitzer, Particl’s communication manager, floated the idea that Particl could one day have its own “app store” from which users could install whatever decentralized application they want to have on their Particl wallet. It is worth noting that Particl Dapps are probably going to be much more scalable than smart-contract platforms as they would work using DSNs (SMSG is not immensely scalable, but IPFS, Siacoin or SafeNetwork are).</p><h2 id=\"conclusion-personal-comments\">Conclusion &#x26; Personal Comments</h2><p>For all the reasons and features mentioned during this presentation, I believe Particl is one of the most under-rated and undervalued projects of the crypto space at the moment. Its impressive set of privacy tools, its highly profitable staking reward schedule, and its highly scalable marketplace/Dapp ecosystem makes it extremely likely that Particl will become a popular and widely used crypto-currency in the not-so-distant future. Another thing that I really like about it is that it is building an entire <strong>ecosystem</strong> rather than being a simple “feature coin” (a coin that mostly does ONE thing well). Not only does having a working ecosystem around your coin make it more resilient to being outdated by newer technologies, it also creates a real demand for it rather than just deriving its value from trade speculation. This ecosystem is supported by a 5% (which will most likely turn into 10%) yearly investment return, on which is added market/Dapps/Txs fees and busted escrow funds.</p><p>Let’s crunch some numbers. If one would buy <strong>$25,000 </strong>worth of PARTs at <strong>$25</strong>, it would give him a total of <strong>1,000 PARTs</strong>. If he were to stake his entire balance, he would be guaranteed 5% yearly, paid every day. The actual more likely number would probably be 8–10%, so let’s round it up to 9%. This staker would make around <strong>0.25 PARTs per day</strong> (1,000 x 0.09 / 365 = 0.24657), or about<strong> $6.16</strong>. At the end of a full year, considering no PARTs were spent, he would have an estimated balance of around 1090 PARTs, a 9% increase valued at around<strong> $2,250 profits</strong>. The actual formula to estimate staking profits per day is as follow: Balance x estimated yearly % returns / 365 x PART price</p><p>That amount, however, is assuming that no transaction happens in the marketplace and that no one makes any transaction on the blockchain since no transaction fees are added into the formula. To calculate how many additional PARTs one would from the marketplace fees, it is possible to use this formula:</p><p>(Estimated number of marketplace listings x 0.01 x 0.5) / 100 x (PART balance x 100 / Particl total circulating supply)</p><p>If the marketplace was to host<strong> 50,000 listings</strong>, the staker in the example above would receive an additional <strong>0.3 PART a day</strong>, or<strong> 11.93 PARTs a year</strong>. At <strong>$25 </strong>per coin, that would earn him additional $298.20 per year for a total of <strong>$2,548.20.</strong></p><p>Again, there are some missing numbers that are harder to calculate such as daily transaction fees and busted escrow funds, so it is almost certain that the actual staking profits the staker in this example would make in real life would be bigger. It is also not taking into consideration the future Particl Dapps that will end up generating fees as well, making staking rewards even larger. I really do believe these interesting figure could propel Particl into top 10 cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Please visit this link to download a spreadsheet I’ve made that will help you calculate your staking revenues taking compounding, Particl Foundation donation and market fees into consideration: <a href=\"http://onlyo.co/2uQdLoM\">http://onlyo.co/2uQdLoM</a></p><p>The only major problem I see with the currency itself is that it could eventually have scalability problems similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum during popular ICOs. Yes, the project will soon get Lightning Network once it is ready, but it is likely that it would be mostly useful for micro-transactions rather than ALL types of transactions. Besides, RingCT transactions cannot be processed through LN and are certainly NOT lightweight in terms of what space they use within a block. Even though I have heard from one solid and reliable source that the team does have plans and methods they are exploring that could potentially make its currency scalable similar to DASH’s levels, nothing has been publicly revealed (or even hinted at), so it shouldn’t be taken into consideration until this is publicly discussed. However, if Particl should ever have currency scalability problems, it would actually be a pretty good problem as that means the platform would already be quite popular and its coin very valuable. Note that there is a distinction to make between currency scalability and market scalability, the latter being already successfully dealt with.</p><h2 id=\"additional-resources\">Additional Resources</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://particl.io/\">Particl landing page</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/\">Particl news</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/\">Particl’s GitHub</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf\">Whitepaper draft</a></li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/particlproject\">Particl Twitter account</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/\">Particl Reddit page</a></li><li><a href=\"http://slack.particl.io/\">Slack channel invite</a></li><li><a href=\"https://riot.im/app/#/room/#particl:matrix.org\">Riot channel</a></li><li><a href=\"https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Particl-Testnet-Getting-Started-d9yhExvCaW6vCp3qLUwuW\">Latest testnet binaries</a></li><li><a href=\"http://explorer.testnet.particl.io/insight/\">Testnet block explorer</a></li><li>Contact info: <a href=\"mailto:hello@particl.io\">hello@particl.io</a></li></ul><p>This concludes this Particl presentation.

In fact, they had been told by the Hong Kong partners, as well as many legal and PR firms, that the name “Shadowcash” was deemed too shady, most of them even refusing to associate their name with such a sketchy sounding project. The new vision of the project also required a lot of major code changes to be done to the SDC blockchain/client and team structure.

To make things worse, their community is actually split into several groups, mainly the community (traders, holders), devs (Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Unlimited) and miners. All these groups have their own motives and interests, and that makes coming to a middle-ground and making a decision all can agree to extremely hard.

The second option, however, required a hardfork and it ended up being quite contentious, causing a chain split (Ethereum and Ethereum Classic). Furthermore, the polling method the Ethereum Foundation chose to use was a bit confusing. They first proposed a “Carbon Vote”, which was a method they quickly implemented to allow people to vote based on the number of coins they were holding. After much criticism, notably from the mining community, they then opted to adopt a more classic method of polling in crypto which is based on miner’s hashing rate (actually almost identical to how Bitcoin is polling its community to implement Segwit or not)."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"We can easily see the main issues with how both scenarios dealt with/are dealing with critical decisions.

Also, even though the Ethereum Foundation says it also took the Carbon Vote in consideration when deciding to go for the hardfork, there were a lot of complaints from people saying they actually never heard of it. After all, only a very tiny percentage of the network went ahead and voted, so perhaps it was too complicated for most people or that the word didn’t spread fast and far enough. What makes it worse is that the voting was based on how many coins you were holding, basically making it a 1 coin = 1 vote.

It could even be a vendor using the system to poll his customer base about what product they want to be added to the store, for example.

The entity who first sets up the vote parameters needs to specify to the community for how long the voting period will be open, specified in terms of block numbers (i.e. for a period of 2,500 blocks). This makes it harder to game as a large entity cannot simply buy, vote and dump instantly. They need to hold the coins for X number of blocks and actually secure the network doing so. Additionally, not only is it completely free to vote, it rewards voters with staking rewards, which definitively is an incentive to vote on stuff and not just hold the coins and go with the flow. The in-wallet integration (notably using widgets) also makes it very easy and user-friendly to participate. The only thing that requires a bit of research is that the voting content (description of the vote, pictures, graphs, etc.) will be done off-chain, most likely on Github at the beginning.

In fact, The Blockchain Foundry (the company who developed BlockMarket) has total control over what content is hosted on its market. It can ban users and delete/censor listings at will, which leads me to wonder why one would even use the platform as it actually doesn’t provide much that centralized marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay don’t. It also doesn’t provide the set of privacy tools Particl offers, making it a no-go for any vendor looking for high levels of privacy. Also, purely from an investment, I believe Syscoin to not be as worth it as Particl because people can use other currencies on BlockMarket without having to touch Syscoin wat all. This is also the case with Particl, however, the latter automatically converts all other currencies into its native coin (PART) in order for a market order to be possible, so even though a user buys something with Bitcoin, it ends up being a Particl transaction, generating demand. It also should be noted that Particl is PoS while Syscoin is PoW, and I believe the proof-of-stake protocol is more fitted for a marketplace as it allows a lot of great features such as decentralized market governance and market fee earnings. Lastly, another problem I see with Syscoin is that should it become very popular, it would have some serious troubles with scalability as all market data are stored directly on-chain (contrary to Particl which stores data off-chain on DSNs)."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Though it may seem that I am hating on the other projects, really I am not.

It is very important to understand that we are not talking about smart-contract Dapps here, but rather hard-coded decentralized applications. To give you an idea, a year or so ago, an SDC community member had started working on a dice Dapp that allowed people to gamble directly on the SDC wallet. The project was abandoned and the community member disappeared, but that gives a good idea of what kind of Dapps Particl could host.

To get a better idea, Paul Schmitzer, Particl’s communication manager, floated the idea that Particl could one day have its own “app store” from which users could install whatever decentralized application they want to have on their Particl wallet. It is worth noting that Particl Dapps are probably going to be much more scalable than smart-contract platforms as they would work using DSNs (SMSG is not immensely scalable, but IPFS, Siacoin or SafeNetwork are)."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"h2","properties":{"id":"conclusion-personal-comments"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Conclusion & Personal Comments"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"For all the reasons and features mentioned during this presentation, I believe Particl is one of the most under-rated and undervalued projects of the crypto space at the moment.

Besides, RingCT transactions cannot be processed through LN and are certainly NOT lightweight in terms of what space they use within a block.
