It’s safe to say, this new revamped marketplace is bound to\nimpress more than a few heads. Not only will it look much better and be a lot\neasier to use, but it’s performance will also feel like day and night for anyone\nthat has used the marketplace before.\n\nHere is the latest development report from Development Manager Henk Swardt.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProgress Report\n * As most of you are already aware now, a new version of Particl Desktop\n   (2.3.3.) was released a short while ago. This introduced a slightly updated\n   marketplace codebase in order to address a bug experienced in the buyflow\n   when using Particl Core 0.19. While the update and change went well, some\n   problems were encountered during the signing and notarizing of the Mac\n   builds, which delayed the release a little. This, unfortunately, took some\n   time to fix and get working again, but eventually got sorted and we were able\n   to release the builds.\n * The basics of the re-implementation of the listing details view (effectively\n   the modal that is displayed when clicking on a listing) into Particl Desktop\n   has been completed. We’re now using this specific modal in more places now in\n   order to provide details on a particular listing or order wherever it may be\n   necessary to do so. For example, it is now displayed during the buyflow when\n   needing to look over the details of the item ordered without having to jump\n   off the page. This is a common behaviour for most online marketplaces and\n   will now be part of Particl as well.\n * After some discussions and testing around the creation and display of product\n   templates, as well as the publishing of them into marketplace listings, there\n   was a need to modify and re-work some aspects of the way this was being done\n   in the new ‘Sell’ section of the market module in the Particl Desktop. This\n   re-work is currently in progress.\n * A new “Inventory & Products” tab in the ‘Sell’ section has been added. This\n   will act as a central place for your products in stock (which effectively\n   means splitting the Sell > Listings tab into two separate ones).\n * Due to the integration of “infinite markets” and necessary for it, you can\n   now see which inventory items are published on which markets and storefronts.\n   This will also help with Quantity Management in the future, one of Particl’s\n   current roadmap items.\n * A new batch publish feature for pushing created/imported inventory items\n   (Products) on the marketplace is currently being worked on.\n * The “Import Listings” section of Particl Desktop has now become “Import\n   Products” and has been significantly redesigned to be easier to use.\n * The interface and usability of the escrow process and Market modals for\n   pushing Orders to next their next stages (ie. Accept bid, Mark as delivered,\n   etc.) has been redesigned.\n * The Market Overview page has been redesigned to work more as a guidepost or\n   dashboard for a quick overview of the latest activity that has happened since\n   the last visit — clicking on a card will take you directly to the relevant\n   place.\n * The Questions and Answers layout has been globally redesigned and reused at\n   multiple places for easier access (i.e. directly in a Listing’s details and\n   in a dedicated Sell/Buy > Questions & Answers tab).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSneak Peeks\nTo better illustrate some of the changes currently being worked on, here are\nsome live screenshots taken from the latest internal builds. Please keep in mind\neverything showed here is still a work in progress and subject to change before\nthe release.\n\nMarket’s Overview Page\nThe Market’s Overview page will now act as a guidepost or dashboard for getting\na quick but detailed overview of all actions requiring your attention.\n\nReworked Exchange Module\nParticl Desktop’s in-app swap section has been fully isolated from other modules\nand now acts as its own independent module. Coins and exchanges displayed in\nthis screenshot are not announcements of any sort but rather a good\ndemonstration of where this module is headed UI/UX-wise.\n\nQuestions and Answers\nAs mentioned in the Progress Report of this Development Update, the Q/A\nfunctionality has now been integrated into additional pages for easier access.\nUsers will now be notified whenever they receive a new question or answer to a\nlisting and will be able to navigate to it without much hassle.\n\nMarket Settings\nThe Market Settings page allows you to manage market-related settings. As more\nfeatures and functionalities get added to the marketplace moving forward, here\nis where you’ll be able to tweak their settings as well as your preferences.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Development-Update--05-06-2020-/1-DDaMGsjP5VvVlMaj3HTYQg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>For the past few weeks, the Particl developers have been making good progress in building and improving on the marketplace as well as adding a ton of functionalities.

Here are the latest progress\nupdates, as reported by Development Manager Henk Swardt.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCore\nOur beloved Tecnovert has been hard at work, Particl Core 0.19.1.1\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#01911] \nhas been released which includes some improvements required by the Ledger team.\n\ntecnovert/particl-core\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.1.1]\nRelease Notes:\nhttps://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#01911\nHashes…github.com\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.1.1]\n\n * Merged Bitcoin 0.19.1 backports.\n * Added generatemnemonic command to particl-wallet.\n * Qt receiving addresses table displays relative paths.\n * Qt receiving addresses page can verify an address on a hardware device.\n * Path of change address is sent to ledger hardware devices\n\nDesktop\nThe new Core version was successfully tested against Particl Desktop 2.3.x and\neverything is working correctly. Thus, Particl Core 0.19.1.1 has been pushed to\nall existing Particl Desktop 2.3.2 clients and to the current work-in-progress\n(the future 2.4.x release) builds as well.\n\nGood progress has also been made to the new Particl Desktop client. The bulk of\nthe rebuilding of the listing template creation functionality is now almost\ncomplete. These changes will still need to be re-visited and updated at a later\npoint to cater for the new changes being introduced in the market codebase, but\nthat should be a minor update and quick to do.\n\nMarket\nA large portion of the refactored market codebase is in the process of being\nmade available as part of the feature branch we use for GUI integration\ndevelopment.\n\nCopay\nAs for the Copay app, we are still looking into the issue that has been causing\nblank history views. We are required to make some API changes and these proved\nto be a bit more tricky than we hoped it would be. Please bear with us as we\nwork through this.\n\nSwap Engine\nWe have added and made ready a new exchange bot and have been adding and testing\nsome additional coins to the in-app swapg engine of Particl desktop. The tests\nhave been successful, keep an eye out for new coins to be available on Particl\nDesktop once the big Infinite Markets update comes out!\n\nThis should get some more people digging around Particl and using it with their\nfavorite cryptocurrency.\n\nHardware Wallet Playground\nAn easy to setup development and test environment for hardware wallets & their\nintegration with particl-core has been set up. The goal is to make an automated\ntest suite against emulated hardware wallets. It is very much under active\ndevelopment, but PRs are appreciated.\n\nparticl/hardware-wallet-playground\n[https://github.com/particl/hardware-wallet-playground]\nThe purpose of this repository is to provide an easy to setup development &\ntest\nenvironment for hardware wallets &…github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/hardware-wallet-playground]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Development-Update--08-05-2020-/1-DDaMGsjP5VvVlMaj3HTYQg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Like mentioned in the previous <a href=\"https://particl.news/project-update-22-04-2020-1a57c0e2b5c1\"><strong>Project Update</strong></a>, Particl is now going to be posting more regular development updates to keep you informed of the latest progress behind the scenes.</p><p>Today is the first such development update!

SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
