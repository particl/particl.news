Download [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases] the\nMarketplace builds for testnet and purchase one for yourself. It’s easy and it’s\nfree!\n\n> All currency running over the testnet is our testnet-PART or tPART for short and\nhas no value.Coins are freely given at our Particl Testnet Faucet\n[http://faucet.particl.xyz/] and you get the added security that you’re using\nhouse money and are at no risk to make a mistake using your own PART.\n\nSales After 1 Week\nWe’ve had nearly 35 users begin the process of purchasing real tees —these are\nreal t-shirts folks! They will show up at your door and the purchase will be\ncompleted without any 3rd-party pushing in to collect personal data and charging\nfees for doing nothing.\n\nThis is actually a great time to bring back the infographic of the sell/buy\nprocess on Particl Marketplace alpha and walk through some of the dialogs you’ll\nsee as you walk through the process.\n\nIt’s also important to note that at the point of this blog publishing, I’ve gone\nthrough the entire order book for the t-shirts and have accepted and/or rejected\nall bids in my queue. That’s important to consider if you’ve placed a bid on one\nof the shirts and you’re wondering the next steps.\n\nBidding\nItems in your cart that you have placed a bid on to purchase will have the “\nBidding” label.\n\nThe label means you’ve sent a desire to purchase the item to the seller and the\nball is now in their court. The same “Bidding” labeled box shows up in the\nSeller’s order book.\n\n> Important: If you have placed a bid on an official shirt and you still see the\nbox labeled “Bidding” then I missed seeing your bid and you should place another\nbid. As I said, the queue I can see in my order book is cleared on my end and\nnow awaiting buyers to actually purchase the items and put it into “Escrow”.\nIn this Alpha version of the Particl Marketplace all bids last 48 hours. So I\nmight have missed your order if you placed it immediately after launch. Please\nplace another order so we can get you your shirts!\n\nAwaiting\nWhen a seller has accepted your bid then the order book displays the “Awaiting”\nlabel.

This is a good example of starting something\nnew in a testnet environment. With a little guidance I hope the process seems\nlogical and with practice it should become easy and understandable.\n\nNow, like I’ve said, I’ve cleared my queue as of this article.

Declined orders are only multiple item orders.\nWe’re trying to limit the amount of free shirts people receive so there are\nenough for others.\n\nEscrow\nThis is the box I want to see in my store so that I know the buyer has gone\nforward and purchased the item. Again, I implore you, if you’ve placed a bid on\nand item like our official Particl shirts, return to the Marketplace and check \nyour cart.\n\nA few users have been confused by the process, understandably — it’s new to all\nof us. Their comments have been that they thought they were buying the shirts\nwhen they placed a Bid on them with step 1.\n\n * Again, refer to the info-graphic.\n\nAfter the seller accepts the bid the buyer still must pay for the item and place\na deposit in escrow. So the seller’s order book will display “Awaiting” until\nthe item has been paid. Then the box changes to “Escrow” and it is now up to the\nseller to ship the item.\n\nTo be continued\nI’ll leave the rest for a followup post as shirts get shipped/received and\nhopefully we start to see some selfies with Particl swag all over social media\nonce the shirts arrive!\n\nFor those users who have paid for the items and are awaiting shipping\n(specifically on the t-shirts), I will begin filling those orders Monday June\n11th.

His\ngoal was to tap into the video blog genre to help promote Particl, as well as\nprivacy rights, decentralized ecommerce and financial freedom (individual\nsovereignty).\n\nWe are excited to bring Desi-Rae on to exclusively cover Particl and also\nsupport her research into other benefits blockchain tech and the space can lead\nus in the future.\n\nI had a chance to ask her some questions about her background and passions\nrecently.\n\nPS: You have an academic process by how you learn and then present your content.\nWhat is your background?\n\nDRC: My background is in scientific research and data collection, as well as\nvisual art, specifically oil painting. I studied Biology and Studio Arts in\nschool and have always been interested in many things and the process of\nlearning itself. As you can possibly tell from my videos, I enjoy encountering\nsomething new and then finding out more about it, particularly by doing research\nthat provides data to answer a question. But I am also interested in the\naesthetic environment of a presentation, in terms of visuals, tone and mood, and\nnot only the presentation of the actual information.\n\nPS: How did you get into the cryptocurrency space?\n\nDRC: I got into the cryptocurrency space through osmosis. I knew and followed\npeople who were interested in cryptocurrency. I had a minimal amount of interest\nin the technology behind it. This is in the sense that I like to understand how\nthe world around me works, and not be ignorant of the basic functioning of many\nthings that I come to rely upon and use. However, I may not know how to build\nsomething myself. I was also drawn into the cryptocurrency space through the\nappeal of investing long term for financial gain, something which is in some\nways barred from individuals who are not already in the financial world due to\nhow the law handles those kinds of scenarios.\n\nPS: What type of content do you want to bring to the Particl community and the\ncryptocurrency space in general?\n\nDRC: I want to bring content to the cryptocurrency space that makes people\ncurious, engaged, and hopefully enthusiastic about cryptocurrency. There is a\nlot of content available for anyone who wants to learn. Really, there are video\nseries and lectures, from any standpoint, such as knowing how to code,\nunderstanding how blockchains or features of a cryptocurrency work, figuring out\nhow to trade or invest, and so on. Anything. Anyone can learn anything. So, my\ninterest is in shaping how a person can interact within that space, with the\npersonalities involved and the way they receive that information. And I think my\nbigger focus would be on understanding concepts rather than the full details,\nand just having a line of communication between the official project and the\ncommunity at large or potential supporters or contributors.\n\nPS: Do you think privacy is important?\n\nDRC: With an emphatic yes, I think that privacy is very important. I possibly\ncouldn’t stress enough how much. People will pay a premium amount of money to\nhave their own space and have thicker walls in an apartment building. A person\ndoes not speak the same way in a space depending who is around. Why do we need\nto dance alone in our rooms before dancing in front of a crowd? Why are ballots\nusually secret? It’s important to be able to reflect in one’s own time too.\nPrivacy is an extension of self-ownership, to have the ability to choose how\nmuch one shares about themselves, their thoughts and feelings. As it relate to\ncryptocurrency, a privacy focused project such as Particl brings back privacy to\nan increasingly public space, due to the power of technology and the current\nneed for people in the background to make things run smoothly as one uses their\nproduct and services, such as services that help us manage our finances or\nparticipate in the global marketplace.\n\nPS: What excites you about Particl the most?\n\nDRC: This isn’t something that I really knew before, but Particl was started by\na group of people who decided to work on something together, as opposed to an\nalready established institution funding a project. I think a great thing is when\npeople see a problem, and try to solve it, or have an idea, and get to work on\nit. I know what Particl is doing in terms of implementing privacy technology is\ncool, for lack of a better word, but I think it’s even cooler that people found\na way to put their skillsets together and create a community around an idea. I\nalso think in terms of seeing an issue with marketplaces such as how centralized\nthey are, or the lack of privacy in financial dealings in general as we rely on\nbanks, it is good to actually find a path independent of simply complaining\nabout how others are not doing it the right way.\n\nPS: How did you get into doing video blogs?\n\nDRC: I got into doing video blogs first as a way to share my artwork with\nothers, bring visibility to myself, and communicate with people who were fans of\nmy work. I then also began to share my voice with others on topics I thought\nwere important as I felt the social and political climate around me shifting.\nOvertime, I found fulfillment in connecting with others through common\ninterests. I now appreciate the gift of being able to communicate with others in\na way that I did not before I was making video blogs.\n\nPS: It is nice hearing someone explain they are still learning about technology\nwhile they are also presenting it. Do you think you are just beginning,\nsomewhere in the middle or a certified blockchain expert regarding crypto?\n\nDRC: I am definitely just beginning regarding crypto and understanding\nblockchain technology! I could perhaps describe myself as an amateur. I have a\nrudimentary understanding of cryptography. I think it will be insightful and\ninteresting for people to see my development and follow along as I learn.\n\nDesi-Rae will continue building her new channel CryptoRamble\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCphRdyvqdktDRm0ruPqPRJA] on YouTube with\nParticl deep-dives and educational pieces on blockchain solutions. While she’s\nexclusive to Particl we also want to tap into the audience in the space still\nlearning.\n\nWe expect her to look deeper into blockchain trends like storage, platform\ntokens, as well as, features that are Particl core values like privacy and\nsecurity.\n\nCurrency-agnosticism is also part of our DNA so don’t be alarmed to see Desi-rae\ntalking about other privacy coins or decentralized marketplaces. While she won’t\ndo full segments on specific coins (don’t even ask ?) she will touch on\nprojects taking different approaches to this huge ecosystem just beginning to be\nbuilt.\n\nShe’s going to bring a valuable educational piece to our project and the space\nand we are excited to support that.

What is your background?</strong></p><p><strong>DRC: </strong>My background is in scientific research and data collection, as well as visual art, specifically oil painting. I studied Biology and Studio Arts in school and have always been interested in many things and the process of learning itself. As you can possibly tell from my videos, I enjoy encountering something new and then finding out more about it, particularly by doing research that provides data to answer a question. But I am also interested in the aesthetic environment of a presentation, in terms of visuals, tone and mood, and not only the presentation of the actual information.</p><p><strong>PS: How did you get into the cryptocurrency space?</strong></p><p><strong>DRC: </strong>I got into the cryptocurrency space through osmosis. I knew and followed people who were interested in cryptocurrency. I had a minimal amount of interest in the technology behind it. This is in the sense that I like to understand how the world around me works, and not be ignorant of the basic functioning of many things that I come to rely upon and use. However, I may not know how to build something myself. I was also drawn into the cryptocurrency space through the appeal of investing long term for financial gain, something which is in some ways barred from individuals who are not already in the financial world due to how the law handles those kinds of scenarios.</p><p><strong>PS: What type of content do you want to bring to the Particl community and the cryptocurrency space in general?</strong></p><p><strong>DRC: </strong>I want to bring content to the cryptocurrency space that makes people curious, engaged, and hopefully enthusiastic about cryptocurrency. There is a lot of content available for anyone who wants to learn. Really, there are video series and lectures, from any standpoint, such as knowing how to code, understanding how blockchains or features of a cryptocurrency work, figuring out how to trade or invest, and so on. Anything. Anyone can learn anything. So, my interest is in shaping how a person can interact within that space, with the personalities involved and the way they receive that information. And I think my bigger focus would be on understanding concepts rather than the full details, and just having a line of communication between the official project and the community at large or potential supporters or contributors.</p><p><strong>PS: Do you think privacy is important?</strong></p><p><strong>DRC: </strong>With an emphatic yes, I think that privacy is very important. I possibly couldn’t stress enough how much. People will pay a premium amount of money to have their own space and have thicker walls in an apartment building. A person does not speak the same way in a space depending who is around. Why do we need to dance alone in our rooms before dancing in front of a crowd? Why are ballots usually secret? It’s important to be able to reflect in one’s own time too. Privacy is an extension of self-ownership, to have the ability to choose how much one shares about themselves, their thoughts and feelings. As it relate to cryptocurrency, a privacy focused project such as Particl brings back privacy to an increasingly public space, due to the power of technology and the current need for people in the background to make things run smoothly as one uses their product and services, such as services that help us manage our finances or participate in the global marketplace.</p><p><strong>PS: What excites you about Particl the most?</strong></p><p><strong>DRC: </strong>This isn’t something that I really knew before, but Particl was started by a group of people who decided to work on something together, as opposed to an already established institution funding a project. I think a great thing is when people see a problem, and try to solve it, or have an idea, and get to work on it. I know what Particl is doing in terms of implementing privacy technology is cool, for lack of a better word, but I think it’s even cooler that people found a way to put their skillsets together and create a community around an idea. I also think in terms of seeing an issue with marketplaces such as how centralized they are, or the lack of privacy in financial dealings in general as we rely on banks, it is good to actually find a path independent of simply complaining about how others are not doing it the right way.</p><p><strong>PS: How did you get into doing video blogs?</strong></p><p><strong>DRC: </strong>I got into doing video blogs first as a way to share my artwork with others, bring visibility to myself, and communicate with people who were fans of my work. I then also began to share my voice with others on topics I thought were important as I felt the social and political climate around me shifting. Overtime, I found fulfillment in connecting with others through common interests. I now appreciate the gift of being able to communicate with others in a way that I did not before I was making video blogs.</p><p><strong>PS: It is nice hearing someone explain they are still learning about technology while they are also presenting it. Do you think you are just beginning, somewhere in the middle or a certified blockchain expert regarding crypto?</strong></p><p><strong>DRC: </strong>I am definitely just beginning regarding crypto and understanding blockchain technology!

[https://github.com/particlcommunity/rfps/blob/master/rfp-0000/rfp-0000.mediawiki]\n\nRFP 1 | Particl Cold Staking Pool\nCreate a cold staking pool for users to delegate their staking power to a pool\noperator in exchange for smaller payouts. Once completed, the code shall be\nopen-sourced for anyone to inspect/audit.\n\nWhat is Cold Staking?\nCold staking is enabled by smart-contract functionality and lets users securely\ndelegate staking powers to “staking nodes” which contain no coin. The purpose of\nthese “staking nodes” is to provide a dedicated resource connected to the\nParticl blockchain and stake on behalf of another wallet without being able to\nspend its coins.\n\nCold staking nodes are intended to be used in combination with cold, hardware\nand paper wallets as well as multisig addresses, making it possible to stake\n“offline” coins with no risk of being hacked or exposing your public key to the\nnetwork. Staking nodes can be set up on any device, secure or not, such as\npublic/cloud servers, virtual machines or RPIs.\n\nScope\nThe recent cold staking hardfork has enabled the possibility to set up cold\nstaking pools where operators cannot run with their users’ coins.

In Particl your public key isn’t (initially) made public. While you share\nyour Particl address with others so that they can send you coins, your Particl\naddress is only a hash of your public key, not the public key itself.\n\n> A hash function is a one-way cryptographic function that takes an input and\nturns it into a cryptographic output. By one-way I mean that you can’t derive\nthe input from the output. It’s kind of like encrypting something then losing\nthe key.\nWhat does that mean in English?\nAll of that is a complicated way of saying that while an attacker with a quantum\ncomputer could derive the private key from the public key, they couldn’t derive\nthe public key from the Particl address since the public key was run through\nmultiple quantum-resistant one-way hash functions.\n\n— Classic!So how does this all fit together?\nThe cold staking feature consists of several key components:\n\n * your “staking node” (running a new wallet)\n * your “wallet” with your coins (much like today) and\n * a “cold staking script” — this is like the script in bitcoin or smart\n   contracts on other alts\n\nOnce activated your staking node signs transactions with its private key, thus\nyour real public key for your actual PART tokens is never exposed onto the\nblockchain, until you actually spend them, in which case the change always goes\ninto a new address where the public key is not known.\n\nCold Staking In Action\nAgain, cold staking consists of the following components — your staking node,\nyour wallet and a cold staking script.\n\nWhat is the cold staking script?\n\nIt is essentially a smart contract that says `if this is a cold staking\ntransaction, then allow the private key from the staking node to sign the\ntransaction; otherwise the private key from the wallet is required.`\n\nLet’s walk through the process of setting cold staking up\n1First step is to setup a new “staking node”. A staking node is a full\nblockchain node which has been configured to stake on behalf of your “wallet”\n(aka it has been delegated staking power over your wallet). This can be a\ndedicated server, cloud or virtual server, Raspberry Pi3+ or Rock64 etc.\n\n> It is important to note that CPU does matter when staking, so do not expect to\nget the same results from a earlier Pi vs the new generation Pi3s etc.\nOnce the node is setup and in sync, go ahead and create a new wallet, then\ngenerate a staking node public key (keep a note of this as you will need it in\nthe next step).\n\n**We have prepared tools which will automate all these steps for you. These will\nbe made available after the hardfork has happened and the Particl blockchain is\ndeemed secure.**\n\n2Now, lets go back to your “wallet” on your desktop and click on “Activate Cold\nStaking”. You will be prompted for the staking node public key (from step 1).\nEnter this and click activate.\n\nSo what exactly did we just do?\nFirst, you have created a cold staking script config which includes the public\nkey for the staking node to whom you have delegated staking powers to.\n\nSecond, you have instructed your client that the next time it creates a block\nfrom staking (leave the current wallet running until the cold staking progress\nbar shows 100%), it should send the outputs back to itself (just like PoS\ncurrently does) but these outputs will be part of the cold staking script.\n\nThird, the next time you spend any Particl from your wallet the client will also\nautomatically include the cold staking script— from thereon. Once the Cold\nStaking progress bar reaches 100% activation your wallet can remain offline and\nthe staking node you setup in Step 1 will now stake securely for you without\nrisking any of the PART in your wallet.\n\nIt is important to understand that along with this new “coin staking script”\nsmart contract, we have also introduced an important consensus rule that applies\nto cold staking:\n\n> if this is a cold staking transaction then output value must go back to the same\naddress with the same minimum value as the input\nIn short, what this means is “If I staked 1,000 PART from my\nPar7ZFotVucq9EyXN6wRNGFwiZGHVN8Xq7 address then 1,000 PART must go back to the\nsame address” for this to be considered a valid cold staking transaction.\n\nThis is important as it ensures that the staking node only has power to stake\nyour coins and not spend them.\n\nIt is also worth noting here that any value greater than the input value, aka\nthe reward for staking + block fees, are manageable by the staking node. So in\ntheory you could — as part of cold staking — send your staked coins back to your\nwallet address (as per consensus) and send the stake reward to a different\naddress.\n\n?Future Applications\nThis flexibility at the protocol consensus level pave the road for several new\nfeatures in the future such as:\n\n * staking pools\n * donating staking rewards to other causes\n * sending staking rewards to exchange to provide liquidity\n\nThe cold staking protocol is agnostic, so that it works with all public balances\n(anon and blind cannot stake) including those protected by multi-signature\naddresses.\n\nIn the future we envision an upgrade to our Particl Copay App that will add Cold\nStaking support. That will allow us to take advantage of the wallet’s excellent\nmulti-signature support and enable a whole host of new security benefits,\nincluding but not limited to:\n\n * cold staking with multi-signature (ie. your “staking node” will stake but to\n   spend funds you will need m-of-n signatures\n * integration with hardware devices (like Ledger or Trezor) for key signing\n   (providing the utmost level of security when combined with multi-signature\n   and cold staking).\n\nBrief statement about tomorrow’s hardfork\nAs the hardfork cometh at midnight, we’re going to let everyone continue to\nupgrade and track the health of the blockchain for around 12–24 hours. We know\neveryone is anxious to build their Cold Staking contract but what is most\nimportant is ensuring the blockchain and all PART are secure.\n\nThe GUI is getting waxed and buffed for tomorrow’s debut and we’re also\npreparing some guides for the GUI so people can walk through setting up your\ncold staking contracts.\n\nThank you\nParticl Team","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Primer--Cold-Staking-on-Particl/0-HrZMzdYyRd0LIyut.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h2 id=\"quantum-computer-resistant\">Quantum Computer Resistant</h2><p><strong>How? </strong>In Particl your public key isn’t (initially) made public.

A staking node is a full blockchain node which has been configured to stake on behalf of your “wallet” (aka it has been delegated staking power over your wallet). This can be a dedicated server, cloud or virtual server, Raspberry Pi3+ or Rock64 etc.</p><blockquote>It is important to note that CPU <strong>does</strong> matter when staking, so do not expect to get the same results from a earlier Pi vs the new generation Pi3s etc.</blockquote><p>Once the node is setup and in sync, go ahead and create a new wallet, then generate a staking node public key (keep a note of this as you will need it in the next step).</p><p><strong>**We have prepared tools which will automate all these steps for you. These will be made available after the hardfork has happened and the Particl blockchain is deemed secure.**</strong></p><p>2Now, lets go back to your “wallet” on your desktop and click on “Activate Cold Staking”. You will be prompted for the staking node public key (from step 1). Enter this and click activate.</p><h3 id=\"so-what-exactly-did-we-just-do\">So what exactly did we just do?</h3><p>First, you have created a <strong>cold staking script</strong> config which includes the public key for the <strong>staking node</strong> to whom you have delegated staking powers to.</p><p>Second, you have instructed your client that the next time it creates a block from staking (leave the current wallet running until the cold staking progress bar shows 100%), it should send the outputs back to itself (just like PoS currently does) but these outputs will be part of the <strong>cold staking script</strong>.</p><p>Third, the next time you spend any Particl from your <strong>wallet</strong> the client will also automatically include the <strong>cold staking script</strong> — from thereon. Once the Cold Staking progress bar reaches 100% activation your <strong>wallet</strong> can remain offline and the <strong>staking node</strong> you setup in Step 1 will now stake securely for you without risking any of the PART in your wallet.</p><p><strong>It is important to understand that along with this new “coin staking script” smart contract, we have also introduced an important consensus rule that applies to cold staking:</strong></p><blockquote>if this is a cold staking transaction then output value must go back to the same address with the same minimum value as the input</blockquote><p>In short, what this means is <em>“If I staked 1,000 PART from my Par7ZFotVucq9EyXN6wRNGFwiZGHVN8Xq7 address </em><em><strong>then</strong></em><em> 1,000 PART must go back to the same address”</em> for this to be considered a valid cold staking transaction.</p><p><strong>This is important as it ensures that the staking node only has power to stake your coins and not spend them.</strong></p><p>It is also worth noting here that any value <strong>greater</strong> than the input value, aka the reward for staking + block fees, are manageable by the staking node.

An impartial review\nof privacy coin projects, something educational, informative and of benefit to\nseasoned investors or newcomers to the technology. Tai and Leon wanted this not\nto be weighted to any particular project and we 100% agreed.\n\nThe Particl team approached the guys with the offer to sponsor their series,\nprovide office space to film the series and provide a professional AV crew to\nshoot and edit the series. Tai and Leon agreed and immediately their research\nbuckets grew three fold; but that’s a good thing! The result was a collection of\nvideos that rank among the most watched videos in their collection of webcasts.\n\n> We couldn’t be prouder to be part of this series and encourage anyone seeking an\nin depth analysis on privacy coin projects Monero, DASH, Shadow Cash, Zcash,\netc… to check out the entire set of videos at \nhttp://cryptocurrency.market/category/profit-potentials-in-privacy-coins/\nAnd behind curtain #1 we have….\nBuzz around the mystery of the anonymous privacy project sponsor began shortly\nafter the first video was released.
