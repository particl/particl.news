This list is not exhaustive, it does not\ninclude some of the smaller and/or less impactful fixes.\n\nParticl Market\n- Update how categories are retrieved for various markets\n\n- Blacklisting of markets (when flagging/voting to remove markets) should not\nhappen when voting but when calculating the vote result\n\n- Prevent automatic deletion of any old/expired listings that are still included\nin a cart\n\n- Fixed removal of a joined market failing if the market has been flagged by the\ncurrent user\n\n- Updated the default categories for Open Market type of markets.\n\nParticl Desktop (Market Module)\n- Updated the identity drop-down toggle as it appears to do nothing if identity\ncreation/addition is disabled and there are no additional identities available\n(which is the default state)\n\n- Present a previously missing \"unlock wallet\" prompt when attempting to create\na new market with an encrypted (locked) wallet\n\n- Display a more applicable error message when accepting a bid fails due to\ninsufficient funds\n\n- Swapped the positions of the public and anon balance amounts in the Overview\ncomponent (to make more sense, and was requested quite a bit by the community)\n\n- Display when a promoted market expires in the Market Browser tab.\n\n- Set the 'Completed and Archived' checkbox in both the Buy > Orders page and\nthe Sell > Orders page, to be checked by default. This addresses a concern that\ncompleted or cancelled orders seemed to disappear\n\n- Changed the country selection filters in the Browse [Listings] page to render\nwith check boxes next to the country name. Clearing a country filter by\nre-selecting it was not very clear before, and this attempts to guide the user\nby indicating that that a selected country can be re-selected to clear it\n\n- After successfully creating a storefront market, the category editor opens to\ndirect the storefront admin to add categories\n\n- Fixed input validation criteria on the Create Market page: max character\nlengths were not validating correctly.\n\n- Display the market ID key on each promoted market, so as to provide a unique\nidentifier for a promoted market.\n\n- Updated the code for retrieving the correct market category list when\npublishing products (necessary due to changes in the Market system's handling of\nlisting categories)\n\n- Fixed an intermittent issue when editing a previously created product in which\na market and category were selected and saved: the category may not have always\nbeen shown to be selected correctly, and the category list may have shown the\nincorrect category list.\n\n- Added an option to navigate back to 'Products and Listings' from the 'Product\nImport' section (previously the only option was to use the main menu to navigate\nback to the 'Sell' page, and subsequently to the 'Products and Listings' tab).\n\n- Fixed the linked URL for Transaction ID's displayed for an order in both the\nBuy > Orders page and the Sell > Orders page, that would always point to the\nmainnet block explorer rather than the testnet block explorer when running on\nthe testnet chain.\n\n-Fixed order notification counters not working as intended, particularly around\ncancelled/rejected/completed orders\n\nParticl Desktop (Wallet Module)\n- Allow for the transaction ID to be copied in both the Overview page as well as\nthe Transaction History page\n\n- Added a warning during address label editing that indicates that the label is\nnot saved until the save button is clicked\n\n- Zapping of cold staking funds is now disabled when the wallet balance is 0\n\n- Fixed an issue preventing someone from disabling cold staking when their\nwallet balance funds is 0.\n\nParticl Desktop (Layout and Styling)\n- Simplified the display of the wallet module's transaction table entries (also\nas viewed on the wallet module's Overview page)\n\n- Tweaked the background blur for modals (looks nicer now)\n\n- Aligned visual changes made in other tweaks with the overall application theme\n(i.e., updated the market visualization in the market browser for the displaying\nof the unique market ID as well as the displaying of the market promotion\nexpiration time)\n\n- Added an explicit section in the market creation page detailing how a created\nmarket is private by default unless the keys are shared or the market is\npromoted\n\n- Minor styling tweaks and cleanup of unused styles\n\nGeneral\n- Enabled the generation of Windows 32-bit builds again\n\n- Fixed an error message being displayed that crashes the application when the\nuser closes the application while the market module is starting up.\n\n- Testing, updates and fixes related to updating Particl Core versions 0.19.2.5 \nto 0.19.2.8\n\n- Allow for specific URLs to be opened in the user's current browser instead of\nin a webview container within the application\n\n- Applied port of code from PD v2.3 to fix parsing of startup params/flags that\ncontain dashes\n\n- Applied port of code from PD v2.3 to allow for the core console modal to\nprocess command string escapings as per Particl Core\n\n- Fixed various spelling mistakes in the text\n\n- Added the ability to display a randomized \"Message of the Day\" on the\nloading/welcome page. These are not currently displayed as the messages are not\nyet available, but the functionality is now available\n\n- Updated text strings where applicable\n\n- Fixed CircleCI test runner to execute again (note: just gets CircleCI running\nagain - testing still fails due to problematic test cases which still need to be\nfixed and/or written)\n\n- Enabled codespell checks during test execution\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe second round of community testing has started, now let's get cracking! Don't\nforget to also spread the word around about the upcoming Particl V3 mainnet\nrelease. Every bit helps, whether that is testing, promoting, or even just\nsharing screenshots and GIFs of Particl V3! \n\nWe are blessed to have such a dedicated and passionate community, and for this\nreason, we'd like to thank you for your continued support and patience as we get\nthis baby ready for mainnet!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

Particl V3 progress update\nwe’d like to share with you. It highlights all the progress made over the\ndevelopment of Particl V3 and indicates what the items that are going to be\nfocused on next week and beyond are.\n\nWithout further ado, here is a list of the items currently in progress and those\nremaining.\n\n> Note: Some items that were present in the last progress report are not included\nin this one. In all cases, that’s because they have been successfully completed.\nIn Progress\nParticl Desktop Testnet Release Builds\nThe team’s getting ready to release the new testnet build for Particl V3. As we\nfinalize the testing of all the latest fixes brought since the last build, you\ncan expect a new testnet round to go live by early next week.\n\nIt’s important to note that the issue preventing Particl Desktop from properly\nlaunching for some Windows users is still present and will be fixed in the next\ntestnet build. Fixing this issue is now actively in progress.\n\nAny support/assistance and bug fixes related to the testnet release.\nAssisting community testers once the new testnet build is out will be a priority\nto ensure the testing phase goes as smoothly and efficiently as possible.\n\nWindows startup bug\nA zmq.node error causes startup problems for some Windows users. The issue makes\nlaunching and properly using Particl V3 impossible for these users. This is a\nParticl Desktop specific change.\n\nAdd a Governance Informational Section to Particl Desktop\nIntroduce a governance informational section to Particl Desktop to display\nproposals, voting progression, and results. This won’t allow you to vote\ndirectly on proposals, at least not yet, but it provides information on how to\nvote as well as information regarding upcoming, current, and past proposals (and\ntheir voting results).\n\nThis is currently just a concept, and Particl Desktop Lead Developer Arnold\nBansemer is currently looking into the feasibility of implementing this feature.\n\nMarketplace Orders Export Functionality\nAdding a CSV export tool for orders from the Market > Sell > Orders page is\ncurrently being explored. This would enable sellers to export useful order\ninformation that might benefit from being fed into other stock systems.\n\nThis is currently just a concept and was a requested feature from some community\nmembers.\n\nTo Be Completed Next\nDelete a Product From the Inventory\nThis will let you delete products from your inventory if you don’t want them to\nbe displayed anymore. This is both a particl Desktop and market back-end\nspecific change.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith all of the above considerations, you can now expect the new testnet build\nfor Particl V3 to go live early next week. We will need all hands on deck to\ntest it out to ensure no further issues are introduced by the wide range of\nfixes this build contains.\n\nAdditionally, and as always, we invite you to post your comments, suggestions,\nfeedback, and any bug you may find on the Issues page for Particl Desktop on\nGithub [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues].\n\nIn the meantime, make sure to cast your vote in the currently ongoing voting\nperiod for CCS Proposal #7. Simply follow this link\n[https://particl.news/delegated-output-management-proposal-is-live/] for all the\ndetails on how to vote.\n\nFinally, we once again want to thank you all for your continued support and\ndedication to Particl’s vision!

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
