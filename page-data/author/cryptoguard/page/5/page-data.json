This feature would work similarly to how users\ncurrently handle public, blind, and anon balances for Particl.\n\nImplementing this integration for Litecoin's MWEB would provide users with the\nability to convert their balances and perform deposits and withdrawals using\nMWEB transactions. However, it's important to note that Litecoin's upcoming\nmajor MWEB update is still required for full MWEB swaps to be possible.\n\nOur research and development efforts in this area will continue in the coming\nweeks alongside other projects, and we stand at the ready for a full MWEB\nimplementation once the update goes live in a few weeks/months.\n\nAutomated Market Making on a Cloud BSX Instance ☁️\nCloud Setup and Automated Market Making for BasicSwapSetup a BasicSwap cloud\ninstance and effortlessly run automated market making 24/7Particl News\ncryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/the-ultimate-cloud-basicswap-setup-and-automated-market-making/]\nTo help improve liquidity and overcome some of the challenges associated with\nrunning BasicSwap in its current form, we've published two video tutorials that\nshow you how to smoothly run the DEX on a cloud server and automate the process\nof providing liquidity on the DEX using BasicSwap's automated market making\nscript. \n\nCombining these features results in a powerful tool: a 24/7 BasicSwap cloud\ninstance that autonomously and dynamically manages your offers. This not only\nsimplifies the process of providing liquidity on the order book, but also allows\nyou to set a premium percentage above the current market price for any pair you\nprovide liquidity to; opening up the potential for earning arbitrage profits\nwith minimal manual effort required on your part.\n\nInstallation Wizard ?‍♂️\nEarlier this week, our community encountered an issue with swapping Monero on\nWindows via instances that had been set up via the installation wizard. After\ninvestigating, we identified that the problem stemmed from a need to update the\ncoincurve dependency and worked on a new functionality that allows for updating\ndependencies directly through the installer. \n\nWe believe the update to this functionality is now complete. However, to ensure\neverything works smoothly, we plan to spend a bit more time testing the new\nversion of the installer over the weekend, with plans to release the update\nearly next week if all goes well. We are testing the fixes on MacOS as well.\n\nThanks to the community for testing and reporting issues and bugs, your help is\ninvaluable!\n\nUser Interface (GUI 2.1) ?️\nWe were in the process of wrapping up the next update of the user interface when\nwe had to shift our focus temporarily to address the installation wizard issue,\nas previously mentioned. \n\nDespite this pivot, we remain optimistic about our timeline; our goal still\nbeing to have the user interface update ready and released before Christmas.\n\nParticl and BasicSwap Media ?\nFrom today onwards, we'll start reporting some of our media and social media\nappearances we've had for the past week in this new section.

cryptocurrency for\nanother in full privacy and without any counterparty risk at all. And to top it\nall, it's completely free to use.\n\nThe platform's unique benefits sure are drawing attention, but as it's still in\nthe early stages of development, some users find its quirks a bit challenging to\nwork with. This has unfortunately affected the liquidity available on the DEX's\norder book.\n\nTo help overcome these challenges and improve liquidity, we present you today\ntwo video tutorials that will show you how to smoothly run BasicSwap on a cloud\nserver and automate the process of providing liquidity on the DEX using\nBasicSwap's automated market making script. When combined together, this will\nlet you set your desired spread based on current market prices and potentially\nearn you arbitrage profits whenever other traders pick up your offers.\n\nIf you want to jump straight to the video tutorials, click here.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAddressing Some of BasicSwap's Main Challenges\nAs BasicSwap is currently in its beta phase, it's natural and expected that\nusers might need to put in extra effort to get it up and running. Fixing these\nobstacles is all a part of our development roadmap, and we're actively working\nto address them through ongoing updates; our goal being to evolve BasicSwap into\na highly user-friendly and intuitive trading platform.\n\nHowever, for those eager to leverage the benefits of BasicSwap today, there are\na few challenges to navigate in the meantime.\n\nThe Need to Run and Store BasicSwap Nodes Locally \nOne of the current challenges with BasicSwap is the necessity to run the DEX\nlocally. This can be resource-intensive, both in terms of CPU usage and storage\nspace as it requires running full nodes — and storing blockchains — for each\ncryptocurrency you wish to enable and swap.\n\nWhile BasicSwap works with pruned blockchains, which considerably reduce the\nstorage footprint, the DEX still demands several gigabytes of space. And while\nthis approach offers the highest level of security and privacy, it comes with\nsignificant resource requirements that may not be feasible for everyone.\n\nAnother consideration when running a full node is the need to keep your computer\nrunning continuously if you want your offers to remain visible on the order book\nand to execute swaps. This can be inconvenient for those who aim to provide\nliquidity reliably and continuously, and makes your setup vulnerable to power\ncuts and internet downtimes. \n\nThe Need to Manually Update and Republish Offers\nWith BasicSwap's current version, offers listed on the order book are\ntime-sensitive, expiring after a maximum of 48 hours. Once an offer expires, it\nrequires you to manually republish it so that it reappears on the order book.\nThis process sure can be cumbersome, especially for those looking to passively\nprovide liquidity and with hopes of earning profits from it.\n\nAdditionally, BasicSwap does not currently have a built-in feature for\nautomatically calculating current market rates for the trading pairs you offer.\nThis means each time you refresh your offers, you need to manually determine the\nmarket rates, another potentially time-consuming task especially when working\nwith multiple pairs.\n\nAutomated Market Making on a 24/7 BasicSwap Cloud Instance\nAs we progress in our development roadmap, addressing these challenges and\nimproving the user experience to make the DEX more intuitive is a top priority.\n\nIndeed, our roadmap includes plans to enable light nodes, remote services, web\ngateways, and the integration of advanced market making strategies directly into\nthe DEX, among other items.\n\nBut in the meantime, we understand the importance of providing immediate\nsolutions to these issues. To that end, we have prepared two specific video\ntutorials that are designed to help you navigate through the aformentioned\nchallenges effectively, offering practical solutions that you can implement\nright away. \n\nSetup BasicSwap on a VPS\nThe first step is to get a reliable 24/7 BasicSwap instance that requires no\nmanual input from you once setup. \n\nYou can easily do this by installing the DEX on a cloud/VPS server. This is\nextremely useful because, once deployed, it won't require you to keep your\ncomputer on at all time and won't cost you storage space or CPU power on your\npersonal computer.\n\nWhile there is a cost associated with hosting a VPS, our second video, which\nshows how to run automated market making on BasicSwap, may help in offsetting\nthe costs via any potential trading profits.\n\nAutomated Market Making Script\nThe second video tutorial shows you how to deploy BasicSwap's companion\nautomated market making script on the cloud instance we've just set up. This\nallows you to provide liquidity on the order book in a completely automated\nmanner, ensuring that your offers are republished when they expire.\n\nWhat's more, it also allows you to peg your rates to the current market prices\nand add a markup on top of that market rate, netting you potential profits\nwhenever people pick up your offers.\n\nCombined with your cloud instance of BasicSwap, this makes running an automated\nBasicSwap node and providing liquidity to the DEX entirely effortless once the\ninitial setup is complete. Simply ensure your server is online, deploy the\nmarket making script, and earn arbitrage profits as people trade using your\nliquidity.\n\nWhy Providing Liquidity is Important\nBasicSwap, as an order book-based DEX, significantly differs from Automated\nMarket Maker (AMM) style exchanges. While AMM DEXs can achieve deeper liquidity\nthrough algorithmic aggregation of all provided liquidity, they face several\ncritical issues that BasicSwap effectively addresses. These include\nsusceptibility to front-running, the prevalence of rug pulls, lack of financial\nprivacy, potential slippage on large trades, and other related challenges.\n\nHowever, order book-based platforms like BasicSwap require more liquidity to\nfill various price ranges for each pair, as this liquidity isn't being\nalgorithmically driven towards a calculated market price. A lack of sufficient\nliquidity can make the exchange less appealing, leading to larger spreads and\nfewer trading opportunities. Conversely, when there's an abundance of liquidity,\norder book-based DEXs can outperform AMM platforms by offering traders more\ncontrol over the prices at which they wish to trade.\n\nIn essence, for BasicSwap and other order book-based exchanges (including most\ncentralized exchanges), liquidity is the name of the game. It's the key factor\nthat determines the platform's effectiveness and appeal. As such, we are calling\non you to contribute to BasicSwap's growth by helping to increase its liquidity. \n\nUshering a Better World for Crypto Trading\nAs liquidity on BasicSwap increases, it will improve the appeal of each trading\npair, offering traders what they need to permanently move away from centralized\nexchanges; a shift that is essential for taking back control over their own\ncoins and financial privacy.\n\nCentralized exchanges have long maintained a firm grip over the cryptocurrency\nmarket, acting as gatekeepers and creating central points of failure. This is in\ndirect contradiction to the foundational ethos of cryptocurrencies. After all,\nrecent events have clearly demonstrated the severe repercussions of\nover-reliance on such centralized systems.\n\nIncidentally, this is precisely the reason behind the creation of BasicSwap DEX.\nIts non-custodial nature, commission-free model, and privacy-first approach\nrepresent the comprehensive solution needed for the crypto ecosystem to progress\nand withstand the upcoming regulatory attack against it. \n\nBy contributing liquidity to BasicSwap, you're not just participating in the\nplatform's growth; you're becoming a part of the historical movement fighting\nfor our digital sovereignty.

Fixing these obstacles is all a part of our development roadmap, and we're actively working to address them through ongoing updates; our goal being to evolve BasicSwap into a highly user-friendly and intuitive trading platform.</p><p>However, for those eager to leverage the benefits of BasicSwap today, there are a few challenges to navigate in the meantime.</p><h3 id=\"the-need-to-run-and-store-basicswap-nodes-locally\">The Need to Run and Store BasicSwap Nodes Locally </h3><p>One of the current challenges with BasicSwap is the necessity to run the DEX locally. This can be resource-intensive, both in terms of CPU usage and storage space as it requires running full nodes — and storing blockchains — for each cryptocurrency you wish to enable and swap.</p><p>While BasicSwap works with pruned blockchains, which considerably reduce the storage footprint, the DEX still demands several gigabytes of space. And while this approach offers the highest level of security and privacy, it comes with significant resource requirements that may not be feasible for everyone.</p><p>Another consideration when running a full node is the need to keep your computer running continuously if you want your offers to remain visible on the order book and to execute swaps. This can be inconvenient for those who aim to provide liquidity reliably and continuously, and makes your setup vulnerable to power cuts and internet downtimes. </p><h3 id=\"the-need-to-manually-update-and-republish-offers\">The Need to Manually Update and Republish Offers</h3><p>With BasicSwap's current version, offers listed on the order book are time-sensitive, expiring after a maximum of 48 hours. Once an offer expires, it requires you to manually republish it so that it reappears on the order book. This process sure can be cumbersome, especially for those looking to passively provide liquidity and with hopes of earning profits from it.</p><p>Additionally, BasicSwap does not currently have a built-in feature for automatically calculating current market rates for the trading pairs you offer. This means each time you refresh your offers, you need to manually determine the market rates, another potentially time-consuming task especially when working with multiple pairs.</p><h2 id=\"automated-market-making-on-a-24-7-basicswap-cloud-instance\">Automated Market Making on a 24/7 BasicSwap Cloud Instance</h2><p>As we progress in our development roadmap, addressing these challenges and improving the user experience to make the DEX more intuitive is a top priority.</p><p>Indeed, our roadmap includes plans to enable light nodes, remote services, web gateways, and the integration of advanced market making strategies directly into the DEX, among other items.</p><p>But in the meantime, we understand the importance of providing immediate solutions to these issues. To that end, we have prepared two specific video tutorials that are designed to help you navigate through the aformentioned challenges effectively, offering practical solutions that you can implement right away. </p><h3 id=\"setup-basicswap-on-a-vps\">Setup BasicSwap on a VPS</h3><p>The first step is to get a reliable 24/7 BasicSwap instance that requires no manual input from you once setup. </p><p>You can easily do this by installing the DEX on a cloud/VPS server. This is extremely useful because, once deployed, it won't require you to keep your computer on at all time and won't cost you storage space or CPU power on your personal computer.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rhRe0WuYgZs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"Easily Install BasicSwap DEX on a Cloud Server and Run It 24/7\"></iframe></figure><p>While there is a cost associated with hosting a VPS, our second video, which shows how to run automated market making on BasicSwap, may help in offsetting the costs via any potential trading profits.</p><h3 id=\"automated-market-making-script\">Automated Market Making Script</h3><p>The second video tutorial shows you how to deploy BasicSwap's companion automated market making script on the cloud instance we've just set up.

While AMM DEXs can achieve deeper liquidity through algorithmic aggregation of all provided liquidity, they face several critical issues that BasicSwap effectively addresses. These include susceptibility to front-running, the prevalence of rug pulls, lack of financial privacy, potential slippage on large trades, and other related challenges.</p><p>However, order book-based platforms like BasicSwap require more liquidity to fill various price ranges for each pair, as this liquidity isn't being algorithmically driven towards a calculated market price. A lack of sufficient liquidity can make the exchange less appealing, leading to larger spreads and fewer trading opportunities. Conversely, when there's an abundance of liquidity, order book-based DEXs can outperform AMM platforms by offering traders more control over the prices at which they wish to trade.</p><p>In essence, for BasicSwap and other order book-based exchanges (including most centralized exchanges), liquidity is the name of the game. It's the key factor that determines the platform's effectiveness and appeal. As such, we are calling on you to contribute to BasicSwap's growth by helping to increase its liquidity. </p><h3 id=\"ushering-a-better-world-for-crypto-trading\">Ushering a Better World for Crypto Trading</h3><p>As liquidity on BasicSwap increases, it will improve the appeal of each trading pair, offering traders what they need to permanently move away from centralized exchanges; a shift that is essential for taking back control over their own coins and financial privacy.</p><p>Centralized exchanges have long maintained a firm grip over the cryptocurrency market, acting as gatekeepers and creating central points of failure. This is in direct contradiction to the foundational ethos of cryptocurrencies. After all, recent events have clearly demonstrated the severe repercussions of over-reliance on such centralized systems.</p><p>Incidentally, this is precisely the reason behind the creation of BasicSwap DEX. Its non-custodial nature, commission-free model, and privacy-first approach represent the comprehensive solution needed for the crypto ecosystem to progress and withstand the upcoming regulatory attack against it. </p><p>By contributing liquidity to BasicSwap, you're not just participating in the platform's growth; you're becoming a part of the historical movement fighting for our digital sovereignty.

MoneroKon 2023 in Prague\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-talk-at-monerokon/], where our team from\nBasicSwap DEX was represented. Our developer, Kewde, gave an insightful\npresentation on the evolution, future, and historical context of atomic swaps,\nwith a particular focus on their application with Monero.\n\nThe presentation is available, in full, on our Youtube channel, and you can\nwatch it here.\n\nWhat we've Achieved Since the Presentation\nSince presenting in June 2023, we achieved significant milestones in our road\ntowards making the DEX more usable, accessible, and feature-complete.\n\nBidirectional Adaptor Signature Atomic Swaps\nBidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) Atomic Swaps Now Live on BasicSwap DEX\nBidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) atomic swaps now live on BasicSwap DEX.\nParticl NewsCangrejo\n[https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\nProbably the most significant achievement since has been the deployment of\nbidirectional adaptor signature atomic swaps, as detailed here\n[https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n.\n\nAdaptor signature swaps were groundbreaking when they were first published\nbecause they enabled atomic swaps between two blockchains, even if only one had\nprogrammable outputs. \n\nThis development was a game-changer, particularly for Monero, as it allowed for\natomic swaps with other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Particl, marking a\nsignificant leap forward in our collective goal of preserving our financial\nprivacy and sovereignty.\n\nHowever, these swaps had a limitation: they were unidirectional. This meant they\ncould only occur when the coin with programmable outputs (i.e., Bitcoin) was the\none being offered. In practical terms, that means Monero couldn't be the coin\noffered in the swap; it could only be received in exchange for another coin like\nBitcoin.\n\nThe introduction of bidirectional adaptor signature atomic swaps by BasicSwap\nDEX is a pivotal contribution to this technology. By utilizing Particl's\nSecureMessaging Network (SMSG), we've developed a method that, from the user's\nperspective, enables the coin without scriptable outputs to be swapped from both\nthe offerer and bidder sides.\n\nFor those interested in a deeper understanding of this significant advancement\nin atomic swap technology, we highly recommend reading this blog post\n[https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/] \non the subject or exploring our DEX Revolution series available here\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n. Additionally, we've published a detailed article here\n[https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/] that compares standard HTLC\natomic swaps with adaptor signature-based atomic swaps, providing more insights\ninto the differences between these two atomic swap technologies.\n\nBetter User Interface\nBasicSwap’s GUI 2.0.2 Now AvailableBasicSwap’s new 2.0.2 user interface is now\navailable, featuring a wide range of improvements to the user experience and UI\ncodebase.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswaps-gui-2-0-2-now-available/]We've been\ncontinuously improving BasicSwap's user interface, and we're pleased to share\nthat a major UI/UX update (version 2.1) is on the horizon.\n\nFor those interested in what this update entails, we've provided a detailed\noverview in our weekly development progress update here\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-22-09-2023#user-interface-]\n. We encourage you to head over there to learn more about all the improvements\nand changes that will be part of this upcoming release. \n\nGraphical Installers\nBasicSwap DEX Installer for Windows Released (.exe)The installation wizard\n(.exe) for BasicSwap DEX is now available for Windows users.Particl News\ncryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-dex-installer-for-windows-released-exe/]We've\nrecently released a graphical installation wizard for Windows users (.exe) for\nthose looking for an easier approach to setting everything up. This new feature\nnot only simplifies the installation process for Windows users but has also\ndriven a series of back-end improvements.\n\nCurrently, the installation wizard is exclusive to Windows, but we're actively\nworking on extending it to MacOS and Linux users. We aim for a release on these\noperating systems shortly, stay tuned for more any news in that regard published\non Particl News [https://particl.news].\n\nWhat's on the Horizon\nWhile 2023 was focused a lot on the DEX's back-end and developing some of its\ncore features, 2024 is poised to be a pivotal year for BasicSwap as we will\nrelease some of its most significant updates in terms of usability and\naccessibility.\n\nHere are just a few main items we plan on working on. Note that this isn't a\nfully exhaustive list and we are likely to work on other items as well,\nespecially back-end improvements and new functionalities.\n\nLight Nodes / Remote Services\nThis improvement will have substantial benefits for users. In the first place,\nit eliminates the need to download the entire blockchains for each coin, which\ncurrently leads to rather large storage space requirements and lengthy setup\ntimes. Additionally, it will substantially reduce the CPU usage of the DEX,\npotentially by more than 90%.\n\nCurrently, running multiple coin cores simultaneously is a resource-intensive\nprocess and is the primary reason for BasicSwap's high CPU requirements.\nHowever, we want to emphasize that running full nodes provides the highest level\nof security and privacy. Therefore, while we're introducing light nodes and\nremote services as an option to improve usability and reduce resource demands,\nthey will never be mandatory. This approach ensures that users who prioritize\nmaximum security and privacy can continue to run full nodes, while those who\nprefer a quick setup and easy access can also enjoy exactly what they're looking\nfor.\n\nWeb Framework\nAs an extension of our current work on remote services, we plan on building a\nweb framework that will enable users to interact with BasicSwap-related services\ndirectly via the web. This step is particularly important in an era where even\n\"Web3\" technologies are predominantly web-based.\n\nHowever, we're very much aware of the security and privacy challenges that\nhosting a decentralized application (dApp) on the web can pose. Therefore,\nsimilar to our approach with light nodes and remote services, any web-based\nversion of BasicSwap will be entirely optional and we will not transition to a\nweb-only approach. Our goal is to provide both web-based and traditional\noptions, catering to a broad range of user preferences and needs. This is key to\nattracting more users and, consequently, improving the liquidity of the DEX's\norder book which is critical to its success.\n\nThe exact implementation of this web framework is still being determined, and\nthe specifics are subject to change as we progress. Therefore, we cannot yet\ncommit to any sort of official announcement. We will continue to provide regular\nupdates on this development in our weekly progress reports here\n[https://particl.news/tag/progress/].\n\nMore Coins\nWe are committed to adding many more coins moving forward. As our focus lies in\nprivacy, we will naturally focus on privacy coins. However, we also recognize\nthe importance of diversifying our offerings to attract a broader user base. To\nthis end, we plan to include different types of coins and tokens like ETH and\nits various ERC-20 tokens, (e.g., stablecoins), in our lineup.\n\nAgain, attracting a large number of users to BasicSwap is essential as it\ndirectly contributes to increasing the liquidity of the overall ecosystem. This,\nin turn, makes the various currency pairs available on the DEX more liquid and\npractical for trading purposes.\n\nSince our presentation at MoneroKon, our efforts have primarily been focused on\nessential back-end developments, which has limited our capacity to integrate new\ncoins. However, as we move into 2024, we anticipate adding a decent number of\nnew coins and tokens to the DEX.\n\nWe're certainly excited about expanding BasicSwap to other communities and build\nmore bridges between communities! ?\n\nTaproot Integration\nBecause Bitcoin's Taproot update isn't fully complete yet — it still misses the\nSchnorr aggregated signatures — we haven't been able to complete our Taproot\nupdate which will bring massive privacy benefits.\n\nWhile our current adaptor signature swaps do not leave an identical hash on the\nblocks of the two participating blockchains, they do result in a multi-signature\ntransaction on the blockchain of the coin with programmable outputs (for\nexample, Bitcoin in a BTC <> XMR swap). It's important to note that this does\nnot disclose any information about the swap to outside observers. The\ntransaction doesn't reveal itself as a swap; it appears as a standard\nmulti-signature smart contract. However, it still doesn't look like a perfectly\nregular Bitcoin transaction.\n\nThe full integration of Taproot into Bitcoin and Particl pairs using adaptor\nsignature swaps will be a game changer. It will make the multi-signature\ntransaction indistinguishable from regular transactions on the blockchain of the\ncoin with programmable outputs, significantly boosting the fungibility and\nprivacy of BasicSwap-powered swaps done this way.\n\nIt's worth emphasizing that even in their current state, adaptor signature swaps\nare exceptionally private. However, we always strive to improve the privacy of\nour platform in any way we can, and integrating Taproot into our swaps is simply\na logical step forward in pushing the boundaries in the realm of financial\nprivacy and digital sovereignty. \"Hide within the noise\"!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you are reading this, we want to express our gratitude for your support and\nfor participating in the open-source, privacy-first revolution — your\ninvolvement is a valuable contribution to this movement. \n\nThank you for being a part of this journey towards a more secure, private, and\ndecentralized digital future.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

This new feature not only simplifies the installation process for Windows users but has also driven a series of back-end improvements.</p><p>Currently, the installation wizard is exclusive to Windows, but we're actively working on extending it to MacOS and Linux users. We aim for a release on these operating systems shortly, stay tuned for more any news in that regard published on <a href=\"https://particl.news\">Particl News</a>.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-on-the-horizon\">What's on the Horizon</h2><p>While 2023 was focused a lot on the DEX's back-end and developing some of its core features, 2024 is poised to be a pivotal year for BasicSwap as we will release some of its most significant updates in terms of usability and accessibility.</p><p>Here are just a few main items we plan on working on. Note that this isn't a fully exhaustive list and we are likely to work on other items as well, especially back-end improvements and new functionalities.</p><h3 id=\"light-nodes-remote-services\">Light Nodes / Remote Services</h3><p>This improvement will have substantial benefits for users. In the first place, it eliminates the need to download the entire blockchains for each coin, which currently leads to rather large storage space requirements and lengthy setup times. Additionally, it will substantially reduce the CPU usage of the DEX, potentially by more than 90%.</p><p>Currently, running multiple coin cores simultaneously is a resource-intensive process and is the primary reason for BasicSwap's high CPU requirements. However, we want to emphasize that running full nodes provides the highest level of security and privacy. Therefore, while we're introducing light nodes and remote services as an option to improve usability and reduce resource demands, they will never be mandatory. This approach ensures that users who prioritize maximum security and privacy can continue to run full nodes, while those who prefer a quick setup and easy access can also enjoy exactly what they're looking for.</p><h3 id=\"web-framework\">Web Framework</h3><p>As an extension of our current work on remote services, we plan on building a web framework that will enable users to interact with BasicSwap-related services directly via the web. This step is particularly important in an era where even \"Web3\" technologies are predominantly web-based.</p><p>However, we're very much aware of the security and privacy challenges that hosting a decentralized application (dApp) on the web can pose. Therefore, similar to our approach with light nodes and remote services, any web-based version of BasicSwap will be entirely optional and we will not transition to a web-only approach. Our goal is to provide both web-based and traditional options, catering to a broad range of user preferences and needs. This is key to attracting more users and, consequently, improving the liquidity of the DEX's order book which is critical to its success.</p><p>The exact implementation of this web framework is still being determined, and the specifics are subject to change as we progress. Therefore, we cannot yet commit to any sort of official announcement. We will continue to provide regular updates on this development in our weekly progress reports <a href=\"https://particl.news/tag/progress/\"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"more-coins\">More Coins</h3><p>We are committed to adding many more coins moving forward. As our focus lies in privacy, we will naturally focus on privacy coins. However, we also recognize the importance of diversifying our offerings to attract a broader user base. To this end, we plan to include different types of coins and tokens like ETH and its various ERC-20 tokens, (e.g., stablecoins), in our lineup.</p><p>Again, attracting a large number of users to BasicSwap is essential as it directly contributes to increasing the liquidity of the overall ecosystem. This, in turn, makes the various currency pairs available on the DEX more liquid and practical for trading purposes.</p><p>Since our presentation at MoneroKon, our efforts have primarily been focused on essential back-end developments, which has limited our capacity to integrate new coins. However, as we move into 2024, we anticipate adding a decent number of new coins and tokens to the DEX.</p><p>We're certainly excited about expanding BasicSwap to other communities and build more bridges between communities! ?</p><h3 id=\"taproot-integration\">Taproot Integration</h3><p>Because Bitcoin's Taproot update isn't fully complete yet — it still misses the Schnorr aggregated signatures — we haven't been able to complete our Taproot update which will bring massive privacy benefits.</p><p>While our current adaptor signature swaps do not leave an identical hash on the blocks of the two participating blockchains, they do result in a multi-signature transaction on the blockchain of the coin with programmable outputs (for example, Bitcoin in a BTC &lt;&gt; XMR swap). It's important to note that this does not disclose any information about the swap to outside observers. The transaction doesn't reveal itself as a swap; it appears as a standard multi-signature smart contract. However, it still doesn't look like a perfectly regular Bitcoin transaction.</p><p>The full integration of Taproot into Bitcoin and Particl pairs using adaptor signature swaps will be a game changer. It will make the multi-signature transaction indistinguishable from regular transactions on the blockchain of the coin with programmable outputs, significantly boosting the fungibility and privacy of BasicSwap-powered swaps done this way.</p><p>It's worth emphasizing that even in their current state, adaptor signature swaps are exceptionally private. However, we always strive to improve the privacy of our platform in any way we can, and integrating Taproot into our swaps is simply a logical step forward in pushing the boundaries in the realm of financial privacy and digital sovereignty. \"Hide within the noise\"!</p><hr><p>If you are reading this, we want to express our gratitude for your support and for participating in the open-source, privacy-first revolution — your involvement is a valuable contribution to this movement. </p><p>Thank you for being a part of this journey towards a more secure, private, and decentralized digital future.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">The Open-Source Revolution</h3><p>We're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital economy that is fair and open to all.

BasicSwap's installation\nwizard [https://particl.news/firo-added-to-basicswap-installer-exe/]. This\naddition makes it easy for users to set up the DEX with Firo using the\ninstaller's graphical interface.\n\nFiro Added to BasicSwap Installer (.exe)The Firo privacy coin has been added to\nBasicSwap’s installer.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/firo-added-to-basicswap-installer-exe/]But we have even more good news about Firo to share today! As mentioned in our\nrecent weekly development updates [https://particl.news/tag/progress/], we've\nbeen working on improving Firo's integration into the DEX. Today, we're thrilled\nto announce that Firo is now fully compatible with bidirectional adaptor\nsignature swaps! \n\nThis marks a significant milestone in our ongoing efforts to improve and expand\nprivacy-first technologies across different chains.\n\nWhat are Bidirectional Adaptor Signature Atomic Swaps?\nHTLC-Based (“Secret Hash”) Swaps vs Adaptor Signature Swaps in\nBasicSwapShedding\nsome light on the distinctions between BasicSwap’s atomic swap technologies\ncurrently available, and their respective privacy and decentralization\nimplications.Particl NewsCangrejo\n[https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/]Adaptor signature atomic swaps\nare an innovative kind of atomic swap, initially conceptualized for Monero to\nfacilitate its atomic swapping with Bitcoin (read more about it here\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n). This new type was necessary because Monero lacks programmable outputs, a key\nfeature needed for the kind of smart contract required to complete its part in\nthe swap process.\n\nAdaptor signature atomic swaps use what's known as \"semi-scriptless scripts.\"\nThis approach allows for a secure swap when only one party has programmable\noutputs (specifically, the other party needs to have SegWit). This breakthrough\nmade Monero <> Bitcoin atomic swaps possible, representing a major step forward\nin the development of decentralized, privacy-first financial technologies.\n\nHowever, the utility of adaptor signatures extends beyond just enabling Monero\ncompatibility. \n\nAnonymous Atomic Swaps\nOne of the key advantages of adaptor signature-based swaps is their inherent\nanonymity. To appreciate this benefit, it's crucial to understand what causes\nthe lack of privacy in standard Hashed TimeLock Contract (HTLC) based atomic\nswaps.\n\nWhy Standard Atomic Swaps are Terrible for Your Privacy\nStandard atomic swaps, while innovative, have significant privacy drawbacks. The\ncore issue arises from the use of an identical hash that is recorded on each\ninvolved blockchain, typically at very close timestamps. Although the hash\nitself doesn't directly disclose any information when singled out, it poses a\nserious privacy threat when cross-referenced against blocks from other\nblockchains. Indeed, blockchain analysis firms can easily detect this identical\nhash on two different blockchains, allowing them to infer that the owners of the\ntwo corresponding addresses have conducted a swap together.\n\nThe situation worsens when the swap involves two transparent coins, such as\nBitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin (LTC), for example. In such cases, the transaction\namounts and the addresses of the participants are fully visible on the\nblockchain, essentially revealing all useful information to passive observers.\nThis level of transparency is akin to smart-contract swaps on platforms like\nEthereum, where the specific details of every swap, including the amounts and\ninvolved parties, are openly visible to anyone.\n\nSuch visibility is a stark contrast to the privacy expectations many users have\nwhen dealing with cryptocurrencies, especially when trading outside of\ncentralized exchanges. It highlights the need for more privacy-preserving\nsolutions, especially for those who value anonymity and confidentiality in their\ntransactions. This is why adaptor signature swaps are so relevant!\n\nSwapping Anonymously Using Adaptor Signature Swaps \nAdaptor signature swaps address the privacy issue inherent in standard HTLC\natomic swaps. When conducting a swap using this newer method, there isn't a\nmatching hash recorded on both blockchains involved in the transaction. This\nmeans the swap-related data remains exclusive to the two participating parties,\neffectively shielding it from external observation.\n\nThis confidentiality ensures that neither passive nor active blockchain tracing\ntechniques can deduce that transactions on two different blockchains are\nconnected. Although one side of the swap — the programmable side, such as\nBitcoin in a BTC <> XMR swap — will still exhibit a multi-signature transaction\non its blockchain, this transaction won't contain any identifiable, traceable\ndata, or even hints that this is specifically a swap transaction. As a result,\nit becomes impossible for anyone to link this transaction to another one on a\ndifferent blockchain.\n\nCan it be Further Improved?\nIn the case of coins paired with Bitcoin and Particl, yes. As part of our\nongoing development for BasicSwap, we're looking forward to integrating Taproot\nfunctionalities into our swap processes. This integration will begin once the\nfinal component of Taproot, known as Tapscripts, is released by the Bitcoin\ndevelopment team.\n\nTaproot is set to significantly enhance transaction privacy and fungibility. It\nachieves this by aggregating multiple signatures in a transaction into a single\none, making the transaction appear typical. Currently, a multi-signature\ntransaction on Bitcoin might still be perceived as non-standard, even though it\ndoesn't reveal extra information to an outside observer. However, once Taproot\nis fully integrated into BasicSwap, such transactions will resemble any other\nregular transaction on the blockchain.\n\nThis update will be a game-changer in ensuring swaps are not just anonymous, but\nalso seamlessly blend in with the regular transaction \"noise\" on the blockchain.\nIt's a crucial step towards achieving the goal of making swaps completely\nanonymous and fungible.\n\nAutomated Market Making on BasicSwap? Yes!\nWhile BasicSwap provides advanced functionality, it is still an early piece of\nsoftware and its liquidity is nascent. \n\nThat's why we've prepared two video tutorials that will help you setup BasicSwap\non a cloud server and automatically provide liquidity to the order book via its\ncompanion automated market making script.\n\nSetup BasicSwap on a VPS\nSetting up BasicSwap on a cloud instance is extremely useful because it won't\nrequire you to keep your computer on at all time and won't cost you storage\nspace on your personal computer. \n\nWhile there is a cost associated with hosting a VPS, our second video, which\nshows how to run automated market making on BasicSwap, may help in offsetting\nthe costs via any potential trading profits.\n\nAutomated Market Making Script\nThis second video tutorial shows you how to deploy BasicSwap's companion\nautomated market making script. This allows you to provide liquidity on the\norder book in a completely automated manner, ensuring that your offers are\nrepublished when they expire.\n\nWhat's more, it also allows you to peg your rates to the current market prices\n(via API price fetching) and add a markup on top of that market rate, netting\nyou profits when people pick up your offers.\n\nCombined with a cloud instance of BasicSwap, this makes running an automated\nBasicSwap node a breeze once the initial setup is complete. You can simply\nlaunch your server, deploy the market making script, and earn profits on your\nprovided liquidity with very minimal manual inputs required.\n\nHow to Swap\nOf course, nothing stops you from picking offers from other swappers if you see\ngreat opportunities. In that case, the tutorial linked below will teach you how\nto go through all the steps required.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn a world increasingly marked by restrictions, censorship, and centralization,\nembracing decentralized and privacy-first platforms like BasicSwap DEX and Firo\nis crucial for reclaiming our digital sovereignty. Each individual's decision to\nuse these platforms plays a significant role in advancing these technologies and\nfostering their wider adoption for the greater good.\n\nIf you are reading this, we want to express our gratitude for your support and\nfor participating in the open-source, privacy-first revolution.

You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nFiro-related Fix ?\nThis week, we allocated time to develop a solution that would integrate Firo\ninto BasicSwap's installation wizard. We've made satisfactory progress, so much\nthat we believe to have a working fix at the moment, but will require a few more\ndays of testing to ensure no unexpected issue arises. As the main challenge\nstemmed from compatibility issues originating more from Firo's codebase than\nBasicSwap's, resolving the problem ended up being more intricate than one might\nanticipate. This task has thus occupied a significant part of our efforts this\nweek.\n\nOnce the fix is live, Firo will be seamlessly integrated into the current\ninstaller. No update of the installer itself will be required.\n\nWeb Order Book Display ?\nWe have continuing work on the development of a web display for BasicSwap's\ncurrent order book on BasicSwapDEX.com. This feature will let you view all\navailable offers on the DEX's primary order book directly through the website,\nwithout the need to download and install the platform. This capability should\nencourage more people to set up and use the DEX, especially if they identify\nattractive arbitrage opportunities, for example.\n\nInstallation Wizard ?\nWe are busy working on a few fixes and improvements to the BasicSwap\ninstallation wizard following community testing and feedback, including the\nfixes related to the addition of Firo. These changes will be included in\nupcoming versions of the installer for the available platforms.\n\nAdditionally, we are currently running tests for MacOS and Linux versions of the\ninstaller so that users on these operating systems can also enjoy the simplicity\nbrought by the installer.\n\nNote that, because most users that had issues installing and setting up\nBasicSwap DEX were on Windows, we opted to focus on providing an installer for\nthat platform first. That being said, be reassured that we are fully committed\nto releasing versions for other platforms as well and are presently working on\nit.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nWe've also made progress working on the user interface, picking up from where we\nleft off when we started mostly focusing on the installer. At this point, we\nfind ourselves in the wrap up phase of the 2.1 GUI update as we test the changes\nand ensure no bugs or unexpected behaviors are encountered.\n\nAs such, we do not expect new items to be added to the upcoming 2.1 release,\nother than what's already been mentioned in previous updates (see here\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-22-09-2023#user-interface-]\n), as we're satisfied with the current changelog and are eager to start working\non new, exciting development projects for both BasicSwap and Particl Marketplace\nwhich we'll announce and detail shortly on our blog.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

We anticipate their return at the\nstart of next week, at which point we'll resume full development of the pending\nitems.\n\nWeb Order Book Display ?\nWe have begun the development of a web display for BasicSwap's current order\nbook on BasicSwapDEX.com. This feature will let you view all available offers on\nthe DEX's primary order book directly through the website, without the need to\ndownload and install the platform. This capability should encourage more people\nto set up and use the DEX, especially if they identify attractive arbitrage\nopportunities, for example.\n\nInstallation Wizard ?\nWe are busy working on a few fixes and improvements to the BasicSwap\ninstallation wizard following community testing and feedback, with more feedback\nbeing collected from the community this week. These changes will be included in\nupcoming versions of the installer for the available platforms.\n\nAdditionally, we are currently running tests for MacOS and Linux versions of the\ninstaller so that users on these operating systems can also enjoy the simplicity\nbrought by the installer.\n\nNote that, because most users that had issues installing and setting up\nBasicSwap DEX were on Windows, we opted to focus on providing an installer for\nthat platform first. That being said, be reassured that we are fully committed\nto releasing versions for other platforms as well and are presently working on\nit.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nWe've also made progress working on the user interface, picking up from where we\nleft off when we started mostly focusing on the installer. At this point, we\nfind ourselves in the wrap up phase of the 2.1 GUI update as we test the changes\nand ensure no bugs or unexpected behaviors are encountered.\n\nAs such, we do not expect new items to be added to the upcoming 2.1 release,\nother than what's already been mentioned in previous updates (see here\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-22-09-2023#user-interface-]\n), as we're satisfied with the current changelog and are eager to start working\non new, exciting development projects for both BasicSwap and Particl Marketplace\nwhich we'll announce and detail shortly on our blog.\n\nBasicSwap DEX AMA on Navcoin's Discord Server ?\nJoin the Navcoin Discord Server!Check out the Navcoin community on Discord -\nhang out with 6409 other members and enjoy free voice and text chat.Discord\n[https://discord.gg/VMAPeHNufC]An AMA session for BasicSwap DEX is currently\nhappening on the Navcoin Discord server.

Let us take a moment to evaluate the advancements achieved in\nthe past few days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?️\nWe're still completing the items outlined in our previous updates, namely\nincluding enhancing Tor server capabilities and making a variety of minor\nimprovements.\n\nPlease note, however, that we are currently observing a delay that is impacting\nthe the development process of Particl Desktop which we hope to resolve shortly.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nInstallation Wizard ?\nThe installation wizard (.exe) for BasicSwap DEX is now fully complete. We have\ndistributed it to a few people to test on different Windows versions, and will\nbe ready to push it live this coming Monday!\n\nThe installer simplifies the entire BasicSwap installation and configuration\nprocess using a graphical interface, eliminating the need for terminal\ninteractions. To ensure a successful installation, please make sure to run the\ninstaller as an administrator, as it fetches certain dependencies during the\nprocess.\n\nNote that, currently, the DEX must still be launched via the terminal. However,\nclear instructions are provided on the GUI upon the completion of the\ninstallation. We will be working to include a workaround to this over the\nweekend, but if we can't make it on time for this coming Monday release, we'll\nadd it in a subsequent update.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nWith the BasicSwap installer essentially ready for release, we're now shifting\nour focus back to BasicSwap's 2.1 UI and UX update, which we've mentioned a few\nprogress reports ago. \n\nAs a refresher, here is a list of items to be included in this update, with a\ncouple of others currently in progress right now:\n\nUI/UX Changes\n * The Place New Offer page has been redesigned for a cleaner look, featuring\n   options to toggle between simple and advanced modes.\n * The steps for placing a new offer have been simplified.\n * Notifications in the main menu, as well as pop-ups, have been redesigned.\n * The settings page layout has also been redesigned.\n * A new setting allows users to choose their default currency for\n   prices/graphs, such as USD, EUR, or Pound.\n * The layout of the Network Order Book page has been revamped.\n * The \"Swaps in Progress\" page has been redesigned.\n * Both the main menu and sub-menu have been redesigned, now with a better UX\n   logic.\n * Styling improvements have been made to the (SMSG) identity page.\n * The withdrawal section of the single wallet page has also received styling\n   and UX improvements.\n * Better styling for shutdown/error/ pages.\n * Styling for alerts and errors has been revamped.\n * JavaScript browser alerts have been replaced with sleek modals and pop-ups.\n * \"Spinner\" animations have been added for both confirmation and waiting\n   periods.\n * Icons have been appended to all primary buttons.\n * Prices are now displayed on the individual offer/bid pages.\n * Various other tweaks, corrections, and code clean-up have been implemented.\n\nChart and Price Display\n * A new option now lets you only display the coins activated on the Network\n   Order Book Page.\n * Preparations are underway for the introduction of two new privacy coins,\n   including their prices, icons, and graphs.\n * The script calculating the volume of each coin has been restructured, and now\n   includes also USDT as a volume measure from exchanges.\n * Added coin volume bars overlay in the main chart.\n\nAdditionally, we've made a couple of changes and improvements to BasicSwap's\nofficial website — BasicSwapDEX.com [https://basicswapdex.com] — which should go\nlive around the same time as the 2.1 UI update.\n\nBasicSwapDEX.com Website Updates\n * Added dark mode as default.\n * Various GFX/layout tweaks and fixes\n * General UX improvements.\n * Added current coins supported (GFX) + table.\n * Fetch BasicSwap-related blog news and show last 4 items on main page.\n\nAdding New Coins ?\nWe are currently in touch with the Navcoin coin team to review the integration\nof the privacy coin into BasicSwap DEX as it has given us a few challenges. As\nit stands now, the integration should work, but isn't officially supported yet\nuntil we find a more stable way to run and sync the nodes.\n\nGiven the circumstances, we are now considering postponing official support for\nit until after the implementation of light services to the DEX, like Electrum or\nBlockbook integrations for instance. \n\nThis approach will facilitate the smoother integration of not just this coin,\nbut future ones as well. Additionally, it will grant many user experience\nbenefits such as taking out the need for syncing the complete blockchains of\neach enabled coin and maintaining multiple nodes at the same time (including\nhaving to manually update core versions whenever important core updates are\npushed).\n\nIf you still want to test the Navcoin integration in its current state, first\nensure that you're running the latest version of BasicSwap DEX and that it is\nnot currently running. Enable the use of disabled coins by typing the export\nOVERRIDE_DISABLED_COINS=true command from your BasicSwap folder, and then\nproceed to run the usual commands to add new coins to the DEX, which in the case\nof NAV, would be as follows:\n\ndocker-compose stop\nexport COINDATA_PATH=/var/data/coinswaps\ndocker run --rm -t --name swap_prepare -v $COINDATA_PATH:/coindata i_swapclient basicswap-prepare --datadir=/coindata --addcoin=navcoin\n\n> Note: A snapshot of their blockchain can be downloaded here\n[https://info.navcoin.org/navcoin-core/bootstrap-your-wallet/] to speed up the\nsyncing process.\n> Note 2: You can consult the related code by checking out the Navcoin integration\ncommit here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commit/4d8d421de65d32a3ae073d9166ff02824ab513f4]\n.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nInstallation Wizard ?\nWe've mostly finished up the installation wizard by now, with successful tests\nacross the board on all three major OSes.\n\nTo get the installer to work smoothly without issues, a notable back-end\nrefactoring of the installation process was required, which was our primary\nfocus over the week. Now that this task is complete, we're down to finishing up\na few minor items before we roll it out:\n\n * Fix some styling and js issues\n * Update the README on Github for the \"build from source instructions\" \n * Compile the Windows executable (yes, the widely awaited .exe ?) \n\nAs we stand today, we are hopeful that we will be able to release the\ninstallation wizard for Windows next week, with a release for other platforms\nfollowing up shortly after.\n\nAdding New Coins ?\nWe haven't had much time to wrap up the integration of new coins on BasicSwap as\nwe opted to allocate most of our time this week refactoring the installation\nprocess of the DEX , as mentioned in the section above. We've also been\nfinishing up a variety of internal tools we've started working on last week that\nwill allow us to better monitor the blockchain and streamline the management of\nvarious network related processes.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nSimilarly to our progress on the integration of new coins, we haven't had much\ntime to wrap up BasicSwap's 2.1 UI update this week as we've focused on\nfinalizing the installation wizard. \n\nWith its release expected next week, we will then resume our work on the\nupcoming BasicSwap UI/UX interface update, which is already in the final stage\nof production.

that has been made in\nthe past few days. Let us take a moment to evaluate the advancements achieved in\nthe past few days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Listed on MEXC ?\nPART/USDT Pair Listed on MEXCA PART/USDT pair is now available on the MEXC\ncryptocurrency exchange.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/part-usdt-listed-on-mexc/]On Monday, we announced that a\nPART/USDT pair was now available on the MEXC cryptocurrency exchange! \n\nThis is a significant milestone for the Particl network as its makes MEXC the\nmost accessible and widely used exchange platform on which PART can now be\ntraded. Notably, it allows for withdrawals of up to 30 BTC per day without the\nneed for intrusive KYC verifications.\n\nWe're optimistic that this new listing, along with the new trading tools it\nrenders accessible to the community such as Hummingbot [https://hummingbot.org/] \nfor example, will improve the trading environment and conditions for the PART\ncoin, effectively broadening its accessibility to a wider audience than ever\nbefore since the project's initial launch in 2017.\n\nUsing Hummingbot ?\nHummingbot - the open source OS for crypto algo tradersHummingbot documentation\nand websitelogoHummingbot Foundation [https://hummingbot.org/]If you've been\nlooking to trade PART or contribute liquidity to its available markets, the MEXC\nlisting is bound to be a major boon for you on that end. \n\nIndeed, a big benefit of MEXC is that it's compatible with the powerful, free,\nand open-source Hummingbot market making and automated trading tool, which means\nyou can now use it to trade PART/USDT leveraging your own custom automated\nstrategies or one from the large array of pre-made templates\n[https://hummingbot.org/strategies/].\n\nAs such, we invite you to take a look at their website, who knows, perhaps\nyou'll find something interesting that also contributes to healthy trading\nconditions for PART at the same time!\n\nParticl Desktop ?️\nWe're still completing the items outlined in our previous updates, namely\nincluding enhancing Tor server capabilities and making a variety of minor\nimprovements.\n\nPlease note, however, that we are currently observing a delay that is impacting\nthe the development process of Particl Desktop which we hope to resolve shortly.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nAs we conclude the week, it is time to review the progress that has been made in\nthe past few days. Let us take a moment to evaluate the advancements achieved in\nthe past few days.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nExploring New Coin Additions ?\nThis week, we've continued our efforts towards incorporating new coins into\nBasicSwap and enhancing certain DEX components to ensure broader asset\ncompatibility. \n\nWe must note that progress on that end is happening slower than hoped due to a\nvariety of roadblocks related to the nature of some of the cryptocurrencies we\nare integrating. However, we believe that starting next week should see the\nbeginning of the testing process for some of these coins as we're finally coming\nto the end of their integration process.\n\nDon't forget that, as part of their integration process, we've reworked some of\nthe components of the DEX to make it more readily compatible with a wider array\nof coins, which means we'll generally be able to integrate new coins more easily\nin the future.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nWe're continuing work on refining the New Offer page, along with integrating\nmore minor improvements to the user interface. As it stands today, the New Offer\npage is nearly ready and we expect to start testing the new layout shortly. We\nwill publish these changes live once ready and properly tested.\n\nParticl Team Funding Request Approved ?\nTeam Funding Request #4 ResultsThe fourth team funding request has been\napproved\nby Particl stakeholders. Thank you!Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/team-funding-request-4-results/]On Thursday, the 29th of August, 2023, the fourth team funding request has been\nofficially approved by Particl stakeholders with an impressive approval rate of\n99.82%!\n\nThe proposal sought 35,250 PART per month from the treasury over a span of 12\nmonths, followed by the requirement of a new funding request to be published and\nvoted on by stakeholders once this one expires.\n\nWe are delighted to announce that this proposal received resounding approval\nfrom Particl stakeholders, achieving an outstanding 99.82% approval rate \n(exceeding the 60% minimum requirement) and a 55.24% participation rate \n(surpassing the 20% minimum threshold). The voting period spanned 5,040 blocks,\nwith 2779 votes in favor of the proposal, and 5 votes against it.\n\nWe want to thank every one of you in the community for this vote of confidence\nand for participating in this democratic exercise. We are all very excited, and\nproud, to be able to keep on working on Particl, expanding its ecosystem, and\nstimulating its adoption along with you all.\n\nNew Particl Website ✅\nWe've also been making steady progress on the new website, as has been the case\nfor the past couple of weeks, which we now expect to have a working version in\ninternal testing soon. Live launch should follow shortly after that!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
