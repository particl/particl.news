This feature would work similarly to how users\ncurrently handle public, blind, and anon balances for Particl.\n\nImplementing this integration for Litecoin's MWEB would provide users with the\nability to convert their balances and perform deposits and withdrawals using\nMWEB transactions. However, it's important to note that Litecoin's upcoming\nmajor MWEB update is still required for full MWEB swaps to be possible.\n\nOur research and development efforts in this area will continue in the coming\nweeks alongside other projects, and we stand at the ready for a full MWEB\nimplementation once the update goes live in a few weeks/months.\n\nAutomated Market Making on a Cloud BSX Instance ☁️\nCloud Setup and Automated Market Making for BasicSwapSetup a BasicSwap cloud\ninstance and effortlessly run automated market making 24/7Particl News\ncryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/the-ultimate-cloud-basicswap-setup-and-automated-market-making/]\nTo help improve liquidity and overcome some of the challenges associated with\nrunning BasicSwap in its current form, we've published two video tutorials that\nshow you how to smoothly run the DEX on a cloud server and automate the process\nof providing liquidity on the DEX using BasicSwap's automated market making\nscript. \n\nCombining these features results in a powerful tool: a 24/7 BasicSwap cloud\ninstance that autonomously and dynamically manages your offers. This not only\nsimplifies the process of providing liquidity on the order book, but also allows\nyou to set a premium percentage above the current market price for any pair you\nprovide liquidity to; opening up the potential for earning arbitrage profits\nwith minimal manual effort required on your part.\n\nInstallation Wizard ?‍♂️\nEarlier this week, our community encountered an issue with swapping Monero on\nWindows via instances that had been set up via the installation wizard. After\ninvestigating, we identified that the problem stemmed from a need to update the\ncoincurve dependency and worked on a new functionality that allows for updating\ndependencies directly through the installer. \n\nWe believe the update to this functionality is now complete. However, to ensure\neverything works smoothly, we plan to spend a bit more time testing the new\nversion of the installer over the weekend, with plans to release the update\nearly next week if all goes well. We are testing the fixes on MacOS as well.\n\nThanks to the community for testing and reporting issues and bugs, your help is\ninvaluable!\n\nUser Interface (GUI 2.1) ?️\nWe were in the process of wrapping up the next update of the user interface when\nwe had to shift our focus temporarily to address the installation wizard issue,\nas previously mentioned. \n\nDespite this pivot, we remain optimistic about our timeline; our goal still\nbeing to have the user interface update ready and released before Christmas.\n\nParticl and BasicSwap Media ?\nFrom today onwards, we'll start reporting some of our media and social media\nappearances we've had for the past week in this new section.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?️\nWe're still completing the items outlined in our previous updates, namely\nincluding enhancing Tor server capabilities and making a variety of minor\nimprovements.\n\nPlease note, that we are observing a delay that is impacting the development\nprocess of Particl Desktop which we are working on resolving.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nInstallation Wizard ?‍♂️\nWe've successfully completed testing BasicSwap's installation wizard version 2.0\nthis week and are nearly ready to pre-release it. \n\nAs a new addition, the updated installer now lets you update the DEX, and also\nincludes additional scripts to update its dependencies and launch the\napplication (not just install it) by double-clicking on an icon.\n\nAPI Key Management ?\nBasicSwap DEX Update Guide — Particl Academy latest documentationLearn how to\nupdate your BasicSwap instance.\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html]\nThe recent surge in BasicSwap's usage led to an instance where our API key,\nresponsible for supplying data for the various coin charts to users, briefly hit\nits maximum request limit. To address this, we've made modifications to how the\ncharting system retrieves data from the API to prevent such occurrences in the\nfuture.\n\nTo apply the update to how API keys are managed on BasicSwap, you must update\nyour BasicSwap instance by following the tutorial here\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html]\n. \n\nWe're planning to implement further measures shortly to improve the robustness\nof the charting system even more.\n\n> NOTE: You can also input your own API key in the DEX's settings if you prefer to\nsource this data independently.\nUser Interface (GUI 2.1) ?️\nWe are making steady progress on finalizing version 2.1 of BasicSwap's user\ninterface, despite encountering some delays due to the need to fix a few issues\npicked up by the recent testing of the installation wizard and the necessary\nimprovements required to stabilize the charting API.\n\nOur goal remains to launch the 2.1 GUI update by Christmas. However, considering\nthe recent delays, there's a possibility that the release might be pushed to a\nfew days after.\n\nMiscellaneous ✅\n * Fixed Dash's download link for OSX\n * Updated Dash Core (users need to manually update, see \"Update Coin Core\n   Versions\" here\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html]\n   )\n * Added the --startonlycoin flag to the update command to only start the\n   provided coin daemon(s). To be used if a chain requires extra processing\n   during the update process (e.g., Firo, Dash)\n * Made running the local Monero daemon the default and recommended option in\n   the install.md\n * API keys can now only be specified in one single location to facilitate its\n   management across the app\n\nParticl and BasicSwap Media ?\nDon't Miss our Privacy Roundtable Tomorrow ? \nBasicSwap is excited to host a Privacy Roundtable with our friends from PIVX and\nZano tomorrow at 9 am EST. \n\nJoin us for this pre-Christmas gathering as we delve into the rise of AI and its\nimplications for our freedom and privacy.

And to top it\nall, it's completely free to use.\n\nThe platform's unique benefits sure are drawing attention, but as it's still in\nthe early stages of development, some users find its quirks a bit challenging to\nwork with. This has unfortunately affected the liquidity available on the DEX's\norder book.\n\nTo help overcome these challenges and improve liquidity, we present you today\ntwo video tutorials that will show you how to smoothly run BasicSwap on a cloud\nserver and automate the process of providing liquidity on the DEX using\nBasicSwap's automated market making script. When combined together, this will\nlet you set your desired spread based on current market prices and potentially\nearn you arbitrage profits whenever other traders pick up your offers.\n\nIf you want to jump straight to the video tutorials, click here.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAddressing Some of BasicSwap's Main Challenges\nAs BasicSwap is currently in its beta phase, it's natural and expected that\nusers might need to put in extra effort to get it up and running. Fixing these\nobstacles is all a part of our development roadmap, and we're actively working\nto address them through ongoing updates; our goal being to evolve BasicSwap into\na highly user-friendly and intuitive trading platform.\n\nHowever, for those eager to leverage the benefits of BasicSwap today, there are\na few challenges to navigate in the meantime.\n\nThe Need to Run and Store BasicSwap Nodes Locally \nOne of the current challenges with BasicSwap is the necessity to run the DEX\nlocally. This can be resource-intensive, both in terms of CPU usage and storage\nspace as it requires running full nodes — and storing blockchains — for each\ncryptocurrency you wish to enable and swap.\n\nWhile BasicSwap works with pruned blockchains, which considerably reduce the\nstorage footprint, the DEX still demands several gigabytes of space. And while\nthis approach offers the highest level of security and privacy, it comes with\nsignificant resource requirements that may not be feasible for everyone.\n\nAnother consideration when running a full node is the need to keep your computer\nrunning continuously if you want your offers to remain visible on the order book\nand to execute swaps. This can be inconvenient for those who aim to provide\nliquidity reliably and continuously, and makes your setup vulnerable to power\ncuts and internet downtimes. \n\nThe Need to Manually Update and Republish Offers\nWith BasicSwap's current version, offers listed on the order book are\ntime-sensitive, expiring after a maximum of 48 hours. Once an offer expires, it\nrequires you to manually republish it so that it reappears on the order book.\nThis process sure can be cumbersome, especially for those looking to passively\nprovide liquidity and with hopes of earning profits from it.\n\nAdditionally, BasicSwap does not currently have a built-in feature for\nautomatically calculating current market rates for the trading pairs you offer.\nThis means each time you refresh your offers, you need to manually determine the\nmarket rates, another potentially time-consuming task especially when working\nwith multiple pairs.\n\nAutomated Market Making on a 24/7 BasicSwap Cloud Instance\nAs we progress in our development roadmap, addressing these challenges and\nimproving the user experience to make the DEX more intuitive is a top priority.\n\nIndeed, our roadmap includes plans to enable light nodes, remote services, web\ngateways, and the integration of advanced market making strategies directly into\nthe DEX, among other items.\n\nBut in the meantime, we understand the importance of providing immediate\nsolutions to these issues. To that end, we have prepared two specific video\ntutorials that are designed to help you navigate through the aformentioned\nchallenges effectively, offering practical solutions that you can implement\nright away. \n\nSetup BasicSwap on a VPS\nThe first step is to get a reliable 24/7 BasicSwap instance that requires no\nmanual input from you once setup. \n\nYou can easily do this by installing the DEX on a cloud/VPS server. This is\nextremely useful because, once deployed, it won't require you to keep your\ncomputer on at all time and won't cost you storage space or CPU power on your\npersonal computer.\n\nWhile there is a cost associated with hosting a VPS, our second video, which\nshows how to run automated market making on BasicSwap, may help in offsetting\nthe costs via any potential trading profits.\n\nAutomated Market Making Script\nThe second video tutorial shows you how to deploy BasicSwap's companion\nautomated market making script on the cloud instance we've just set up. This\nallows you to provide liquidity on the order book in a completely automated\nmanner, ensuring that your offers are republished when they expire.\n\nWhat's more, it also allows you to peg your rates to the current market prices\nand add a markup on top of that market rate, netting you potential profits\nwhenever people pick up your offers.\n\nCombined with your cloud instance of BasicSwap, this makes running an automated\nBasicSwap node and providing liquidity to the DEX entirely effortless once the\ninitial setup is complete. Simply ensure your server is online, deploy the\nmarket making script, and earn arbitrage profits as people trade using your\nliquidity.\n\nWhy Providing Liquidity is Important\nBasicSwap, as an order book-based DEX, significantly differs from Automated\nMarket Maker (AMM) style exchanges. While AMM DEXs can achieve deeper liquidity\nthrough algorithmic aggregation of all provided liquidity, they face several\ncritical issues that BasicSwap effectively addresses. These include\nsusceptibility to front-running, the prevalence of rug pulls, lack of financial\nprivacy, potential slippage on large trades, and other related challenges.\n\nHowever, order book-based platforms like BasicSwap require more liquidity to\nfill various price ranges for each pair, as this liquidity isn't being\nalgorithmically driven towards a calculated market price. A lack of sufficient\nliquidity can make the exchange less appealing, leading to larger spreads and\nfewer trading opportunities. Conversely, when there's an abundance of liquidity,\norder book-based DEXs can outperform AMM platforms by offering traders more\ncontrol over the prices at which they wish to trade.\n\nIn essence, for BasicSwap and other order book-based exchanges (including most\ncentralized exchanges), liquidity is the name of the game. It's the key factor\nthat determines the platform's effectiveness and appeal. As such, we are calling\non you to contribute to BasicSwap's growth by helping to increase its liquidity. \n\nUshering a Better World for Crypto Trading\nAs liquidity on BasicSwap increases, it will improve the appeal of each trading\npair, offering traders what they need to permanently move away from centralized\nexchanges; a shift that is essential for taking back control over their own\ncoins and financial privacy.\n\nCentralized exchanges have long maintained a firm grip over the cryptocurrency\nmarket, acting as gatekeepers and creating central points of failure. This is in\ndirect contradiction to the foundational ethos of cryptocurrencies. After all,\nrecent events have clearly demonstrated the severe repercussions of\nover-reliance on such centralized systems.\n\nIncidentally, this is precisely the reason behind the creation of BasicSwap DEX.\nIts non-custodial nature, commission-free model, and privacy-first approach\nrepresent the comprehensive solution needed for the crypto ecosystem to progress\nand withstand the upcoming regulatory attack against it. \n\nBy contributing liquidity to BasicSwap, you're not just participating in the\nplatform's growth; you're becoming a part of the historical movement fighting\nfor our digital sovereignty. Your involvement plays a crucial role in shaping a\nmore secure and decentralized future for cryptocurrency trading.\n\nFor this reason, we invite you to join us in this initiative today. Together, we\ncan make a significant impact, and we thank you for standing alongside with us\nin this important life mission.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

This can be resource-intensive, both in terms of CPU usage and storage space as it requires running full nodes — and storing blockchains — for each cryptocurrency you wish to enable and swap.</p><p>While BasicSwap works with pruned blockchains, which considerably reduce the storage footprint, the DEX still demands several gigabytes of space.

This can be inconvenient for those who aim to provide liquidity reliably and continuously, and makes your setup vulnerable to power cuts and internet downtimes. </p><h3 id=\"the-need-to-manually-update-and-republish-offers\">The Need to Manually Update and Republish Offers</h3><p>With BasicSwap's current version, offers listed on the order book are time-sensitive, expiring after a maximum of 48 hours. Once an offer expires, it requires you to manually republish it so that it reappears on the order book. This process sure can be cumbersome, especially for those looking to passively provide liquidity and with hopes of earning profits from it.</p><p>Additionally, BasicSwap does not currently have a built-in feature for automatically calculating current market rates for the trading pairs you offer.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]Following last week's release\nof the MVP for multi-net capabilities using Simplex as the first alternative\nnetwork, we've identified several Simplex-specific issues that we're currently\nworking to resolve.\n\nDue to Simplex's complex and intricate network architecture, these issues are\nproving challenging to address, requiring additional development time.
