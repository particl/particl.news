So let's quickly see what progress has been made in the past\nfew days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop\nAs has been the case for the past few updates, we're still working through\nincrementally separating Particl Core from Particl Desktop and, by the same\nprocess, adding more user configuration options to the desktop client.\n\nAs we've mentioned in previous progress reports, this is a large but essential\nstep as we move ahead with Particl's upcoming development cycle\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/] which transforms\nthe ecosystem's architecture with a modular approach.\n\nParticl Core\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As usual, we've been\nkeeping up with upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain\nParticl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. You can always keep track\nof those changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nInvestigating a Node Issue ?\nEarlier today, we observed some cases of staking nodes getting stuck at a\nprevious block and not staking anymore. We are currently investigating the\nissue, but in the meantime, please check your node(s) to ensure that they are\n(1) staking correctly and (2) on the latest block (you can verify the current\nblock number here [https://explorer.particl.io/] or directly using Partyman's \npartyman/partyman status command.\n\nIf your node appears out of sync, you can fix the problem by simply restarting\nit. On Partyman, you can do this by typing partyman/partyman restart. If you're\nusing Particl Qt or Particl Desktop, close the application completely and\nre-open it.\n\n> Note: After restarting, make sure that your node successfully syncs to the\nlatest block. In rare cases, it may take a couple of restarts for this to\nhappen.\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week, we've completed the important process of building a standardized way\nto integrate certain Bitcoin-based cryptocurrencies into BasicSwap. However, we\nhaven't tested the entire process on mainnet yet, which we'll be doing over the\ncourse of next week.\n\nOnce ready, it'll make it much easier and faster to integrate various\ncryptocurrencies that meet certain criteria for cross-chain swapping. This will\nhelp the Particl team work through integrations faster and let other projects\nbuild their own coin integrations.\n\nBasicSwap Front-end ?\nWe've also been making steady progress on the finalization and testing of\nBasicSwap's GUI in preparation for the open beta launch. Here's a summary of\nwhat we've completed, fixed, or improved to the user interface this week.\n\n 1. Updated the error/confirm modals\n 2. Finished most templates for the order book tables\n 3. Tested the GUI across multiple browsers\n 4. Added a \"mobile-friendly\" menu for small resolution screens and mobile\n    devices (requires browsing to the IP address of your local BasicSwap\n    instance for now) \n 5. Improved some parts of the https_server\n 6. Wrapped up the intro page\n 7. Fixed a variety of bugs and issues with the user interface\n\nVote for Team Proposal Ongoing ?\nTeam Funding Proposal #3Learn all the details about the Particl team’s third\nfunding request from the Treasury Fund.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/team-funding-proposal-3/]This Wednesday, the voting round\nfor the Particl team's 3rd funding proposal\n[https://particl.news/team-funding-proposal-3/] has started and is currently\nongoing. The vote is expected to end roughly this coming Wednesday.\n\nYou can vote by following the step-by-step instructions available here\n[https://particl.wiki/tutorial/staking/how-to-vote/]. To monitor the results in\nreal-time, you can either open up the Governance app on Particl Desktop or use\nthe partyman/partyman proposal tally command on Partyman (tally votes for\nproposal 11).\n\nFinally, to verify that you are voting correctly, you can use the votehistory \ncommand on Particl Desktop and Particl Qt, and ~/particlcore/particl-cli\nvotehistory on Partyman. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
