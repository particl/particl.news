So let's quickly see what progress has been made in the past\nfew days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop\nAs has been the case for the past few updates, we're still working through\nincrementally separating Particl Core from Particl Desktop and, by the same\nprocess, adding more user configuration options to the desktop client.\n\nAs we've mentioned in previous progress reports, this is a large but essential\nstep as we move ahead with Particl's upcoming development cycle\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/] which transforms\nthe ecosystem's architecture with a modular approach.\n\nParticl Core\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As usual, we've been\nkeeping up with upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain\nParticl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. You can always keep track\nof those changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nInvestigating a Node Issue ?\nEarlier today, we observed some cases of staking nodes getting stuck at a\nprevious block and not staking anymore. We are currently investigating the\nissue, but in the meantime, please check your node(s) to ensure that they are\n(1) staking correctly and (2) on the latest block (you can verify the current\nblock number here [https://explorer.particl.io/] or directly using Partyman's \npartyman/partyman status command.\n\nIf your node appears out of sync, you can fix the problem by simply restarting\nit. On Partyman, you can do this by typing partyman/partyman restart. If you're\nusing Particl Qt or Particl Desktop, close the application completely and\nre-open it.\n\n> Note: After restarting, make sure that your node successfully syncs to the\nlatest block. In rare cases, it may take a couple of restarts for this to\nhappen.\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week, we've completed the important process of building a standardized way\nto integrate certain Bitcoin-based cryptocurrencies into BasicSwap. However, we\nhaven't tested the entire process on mainnet yet, which we'll be doing over the\ncourse of next week.\n\nOnce ready, it'll make it much easier and faster to integrate various\ncryptocurrencies that meet certain criteria for cross-chain swapping. This will\nhelp the Particl team work through integrations faster and let other projects\nbuild their own coin integrations.\n\nBasicSwap Front-end ?\nWe've also been making steady progress on the finalization and testing of\nBasicSwap's GUI in preparation for the open beta launch. Here's a summary of\nwhat we've completed, fixed, or improved to the user interface this week.\n\n 1. Updated the error/confirm modals\n 2. Finished most templates for the order book tables\n 3. Tested the GUI across multiple browsers\n 4. Added a \"mobile-friendly\" menu for small resolution screens and mobile\n    devices (requires browsing to the IP address of your local BasicSwap\n    instance for now) \n 5. Improved some parts of the https_server\n 6. Wrapped up the intro page\n 7. Fixed a variety of bugs and issues with the user interface\n\nVote for Team Proposal Ongoing ?\nTeam Funding Proposal #3Learn all the details about the Particl team’s third\nfunding request from the Treasury Fund.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/team-funding-proposal-3/]This Wednesday, the voting round\nfor the Particl team's 3rd funding proposal\n[https://particl.news/team-funding-proposal-3/] has started and is currently\nongoing. The vote is expected to end roughly this coming Wednesday.\n\nYou can vote by following the step-by-step instructions available here\n[https://particl.wiki/tutorial/staking/how-to-vote/]. To monitor the results in\nreal-time, you can either open up the Governance app on Particl Desktop or use\nthe partyman/partyman proposal tally command on Partyman (tally votes for\nproposal 11).\n\nFinally, to verify that you are voting correctly, you can use the votehistory \ncommand on Particl Desktop and Particl Qt, and ~/particlcore/particl-cli\nvotehistory on Partyman. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

Regardless, the proposal was still overwhelmingly approved, and its\nparticipation rate has been well over the required threshold of 20%.\n\n> Note: The Particl.page pool [https://particl.page/pool/] operator had previously\nannounced they were shutting down their staking pool as a result of an\nunfortunate series of events on their end while resolving the staking node\nissue, but later communicated that they were working on a potential solution\nthat would allow them to remain online. Please check out their blog\n[https://particl.page/articles/] [https://particl.page/articles/] to follow the\nnews and stay up-to-date regarding their recovery process. \n\nNote that no funds were lost or compromised, as per the secure nature of cold\nstaking.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

So let's quickly see what progress has been made in the past\nfew days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nAs has been the case for the past few updates, we're still working through\nincrementally separating Particl Core from Particl Desktop and, by the same\nprocess, adding more user configuration options to the desktop client. \n\nAs we've mentioned in previous progress reports, this is a large but essential\nstep as we move ahead with Particl's upcoming development cycle\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/] which transforms\nthe ecosystem's architecture with a modular approach.\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Update\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As usual, we've been\nkeeping up with upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain\nParticl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. You can always keep track\nof those changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week, we've been exploring the integration of certain coins on BasicSwap.\nWe're working on preparing example commits showing other projects which may want\nto integrate their coins onto BasicSwap how to do it themselves. However,\nBasicSwap's true cross-chain nature makes it impossible to have a\none-size-fits-all coin integration solution. Still, the example commits we're\nworking on will nonetheless be able to facilitate the integration process of a\ndecent number of coins.\n\nAdditionally, we've made significant progress on the DEX's GUI. We're currently\nworking through a few issues and adding improvements as we test it before\nreleasing publicly. But, just as a small end-of-week teaser, here is what the\ncurrent order book page looks like!\n\nListing Seeding Proposal Progress Update\nIt seems like we're long overdue for an update on the listing seeding proposal!\nAs it stands right now, we've got two short-term priorities related to Particl\nDesktop and the marketplace:\n\n * Completing the Particl Desktop 3.3 changes and releasing it\n * Deploying the listing seeding system\n\nAnd while we're currently primarily focused on the changes related to Particl\nDesktop 3.3, we've already begun working on the listing seeding proposal's\ndeliverable, notably by adding product codes in the last Particl Desktop update,\nwhich is a requirement for an improved, more complete vision we have for this\nproposal. But what is this \"improved vision\"?\n\nListing Seeding Proposal 2.0\nSince we've published the original listing seeding proposal, many things have\nchanged around the Particl project, especially considering last week's major\nannouncement of an evolutionary leap forward for the ecosystem\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/].\n\nFor this reason, we've re-imagined what we intend to deliver for the proposal so\nthat it fits better with this new direction and have designed a more complete\nand open system that will drastically improve the life of Particl sellers — not\njust populate the marketplace with listings.\n\nAs opposed to building a relatively closed system for the exclusive purpose of\nseeding listings on the marketplace, we're now opting to build an open \"power\nseller\" standalone application intended to be released publicly.\n\nThis system will act as an external, advanced inventory and order management\ntool built for power Particl sellers. This will open up a ton of opportunities\nfor sellers by giving them access to more advanced capabilities. Notably, you\ncan expect most or all standard seller features to be available, such as the\nability to easily create, manage and publish listings as well as up escrow\nparameters, manage shipping, orders, and even chat conversations outside of\nParticl Desktop.\n\nBut, to complement these functionalities, sellers will be able to automate a lot\nof the typical seller-related processes such as automatically relisting\nmarketplace items, accepting and processing orders according to set preferences,\nand etc. When properly set up, it will allow sellers run their shops almost on\nauto-pilot and will dramatically reduce the time it requires to manage large\nseller accounts on Particl.\n\nAnother key function of this system will be in how it connects a seller\ninventory to a WooCommerce store (and, eventually, additional external platforms\nas we march through the upcoming development cycle). The main benefit here is\nthe ability to install and use a wide variety of WooCommerce plugins (i.e., an\nautomated dropshipping system like Dropified). This will grant sellers many more\noptions than ever before on Particl Marketplace, a taste of what's to be\npossible with Particl's new modular and open architecture.\n\n> Note: The system will be released with incremental feature updates.\nDeploying a Mobile Version of the Marketplace Quicker\nOne of the main reasons we've opted to change the design of the listing seeding\nproposal is to be able to release a buyer-focused mobile version of the\nmarketplace\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward#new-particl-dapps-are-coming-around] \nmuch quicker. That way, there is no requirement to wait for the full version of\nthe improved marketplace to be ready before we can start releasing new products.\n\nIndeed, because the first few versions of the upcoming mobile version of the\nmarketplace will be exclusively buyer-focused, sellers still need to be able to\npublish listings for buyers to buy. And since listings posted on the current\nversion of the marketplace won't show up on the new version (because the\ncodebases will be vastly different), there needs to be a way for sellers to\npublish listings while we build the full version of the marketplace.\n\nAnd that's where the listing seeding tool comes in handy. It will let sellers\nsell their products and services on the new version of the marketplace while we\nincrementally build the full version (on desktop and web). In other words, we'll\nuse this tool as an intermediary for sellers, allowing us to deploy the\nbuyer-focused mobile version of the marketplace more quickly and keep things\nmoving smoothly.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

As it stands right now, we've got two short-term priorities related to Particl Desktop and the marketplace:</p><ul><li>Completing the Particl Desktop 3.3 changes and releasing it</li><li>Deploying the listing seeding system</li></ul><p>And while we're currently primarily focused on the changes related to Particl Desktop 3.3, we've already begun working on the listing seeding proposal's deliverable, notably by adding product codes in the last Particl Desktop update, which is a requirement for an improved, more complete vision we have for this proposal. But what is this \"improved vision\"?</p><h3 id=\"listing-seeding-proposal-2-0\">Listing Seeding Proposal 2.0</h3><p>Since we've published the original listing seeding proposal, many things have changed around the Particl project, especially considering <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/\">last week's major announcement of an evolutionary leap forward for the ecosystem</a>.</p><p>For this reason, <strong>we've re-imagined what we intend to deliver for the proposal</strong> so that it fits better with this new direction and have designed a more complete and open system that will drastically improve the life of Particl sellers — not just populate the marketplace with listings.</p><p>As opposed to building a relatively closed system for the exclusive purpose of seeding listings on the marketplace, we're now opting to build an open \"power seller\" standalone application intended to be released publicly.</p><p>This system will act as an external, advanced inventory and order management tool built for power Particl sellers. This will open up a ton of opportunities for sellers by giving them access to more advanced capabilities. Notably, you can expect most or all standard seller features to be available, such as the ability to easily create, manage and publish listings as well as up escrow parameters, manage shipping, orders, and even chat conversations outside of Particl Desktop.</p><p>But, to complement these functionalities, sellers will be able to automate a lot of the typical seller-related processes such as automatically relisting marketplace items, accepting and processing orders according to set preferences, and etc. When properly set up, it will allow sellers run their shops almost on auto-pilot and will dramatically reduce the time it requires to manage large seller accounts on Particl.</p><p>Another key function of this system will be in how it connects a seller inventory to a WooCommerce store (and, eventually, additional external platforms as we march through the upcoming development cycle). The main benefit here is the ability to install and use a wide variety of WooCommerce plugins (i.e., an automated dropshipping system like Dropified). This will grant sellers many more options than ever before on Particl Marketplace, a taste of what's to be possible with Particl's new modular and open architecture.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> The system will be released with incremental feature updates.</em></blockquote><h3 id=\"deploying-a-mobile-version-of-the-marketplace-quicker\">Deploying a Mobile Version of the Marketplace Quicker</h3><p>One of the main reasons we've opted to change the design of the listing seeding proposal is to be able to release a <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward#new-particl-dapps-are-coming-around\">buyer-focused mobile version of the marketplace</a> much quicker. That way, there is no requirement to wait for the full version of the improved marketplace to be ready before we can start releasing new products.</p><p>Indeed, because the first few versions of the upcoming mobile version of the marketplace will be exclusively buyer-focused, sellers still need to be able to publish listings for buyers to buy. And since listings posted on the current version of the marketplace won't show up on the new version (because the codebases will be vastly different), there needs to be a way for sellers to publish listings while we build the full version of the marketplace.</p><p>And that's where the listing seeding tool comes in handy. It will let sellers sell their products and services on the new version of the marketplace while we incrementally build the full version (on desktop and web). In other words, we'll use this tool as an intermediary for sellers, allowing us to deploy the buyer-focused mobile version of the marketplace more quickly and keep things moving smoothly.</p><hr><p>As always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and what it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nMulti-Net Support ?\nMultinet by tecnovert · Pull Request #311 · basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
