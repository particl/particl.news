This script is intended to be executed on staking nodes as a companion\nto the Partyman [https://github.com/dasource/partyman] cold staking application,\nbut can also be executed without Partyman [https://github.com/dasource/partyman] \nbeing installed on the node. In that case, Partyman\n[https://github.com/dasource/partyman] will automatically be installed to the\nlatest version by the Private Cold Staking script.\n\n> Note: Partyman [https://github.com/dasource/partyman] is the application\nrequired to create and run a cold staking node on the Particl network. Follow \nthis tutorial\n[https://particl.news/guide-setting-up-particl-cold-staking-f5d9073bac4] to\nlearn how to install and use it so that you can safely cold stake your funds.\nPrivate Cold Staking V1.0Download: https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking\n\nGBen1/Private-Coldstaking [https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking]\nThis script allows you to anonymize automatically your coldstaking rewards on\nyour node and to redirect them… [https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking]\ngithub.com [https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking]\n\nTo install directly on your staking node, type the following commands:\n\ncd ~ && git clone https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking.git\n\ncd Private-Coldstaking && bash privatecoldstaking.sh\n\nPPoS — A Security-Focused Proof-of-Stake Protocol\nParticl Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) is Particl’s very own and super secure\nProof-of-Stake algorithm. In fact, it is one of the most secure PoS algorithms\nin the blockchain space due to its cold staking capabilities.\n\nFor those not familiar with it, cold staking allows you to delegate the staking\nweight of your funds to a node which contains no coin, meaning that the wallet\nthat actually holds the coins can be taken offline and still contribute to\nsecuring the Particl network (and receive staking rewards for it). What makes\nthe cold staking capabilities of PPoS even more secure is the fact that it can\nbe used in combination with a hardware wallet like a Ledger Nano S device, for\nexample, bringing its level of security to an absurdly high level.\n\nOne thing Particl Proof-of-Stake does not do, however, is private/stealth\nstaking. In other words, you can only stake funds held in public balances, but\nnot in blind or anon balances. But considering the great privacy protocols\navailable on the Particl network (Confidential Transactions (CT) and RingCT),\nthere really shouldn’t be any reason why staking privately shouldn’t be\npossible.\n\nWhy isn’t PPoS Private by Default in the First Place?\nAs the previous section of this blog post mentions, PPoS is a security-focused\nProof-of-Stake protocol, meaning security comes first before anything else.\nAfter all, PoS protocols are what’s responsible for the verification of\ntransactions and the creation of coins on the network. If something goes wrong\nhere, it can spell a lot of troubles for the chain.\n\nThe main issue with a fully private Proof-of-Stake protocol is auditability. In\nfact, while it could be proven without a doubt that the inflation model is fine\n(you can prove the right amount of coins is being created at the right time, and\nyou can detect if an exploit if being used to create a fraudulent amount of\ncoins at the inflation level), it’s not possible, however, to detect some edge\ncases where an attacker would be able to create coins out of thin air without\nissuing them through the usual inflation process.\n\nNote that Proof-of-Work coins with a “private by default” approach to mining,\nsuch as Monero, are also vulnerable to this issue. This isn’t a vulnerability\nthat is exclusive to Proof-of-Stake. At this point, there has been a few\ninstances of inflation-related attacks, notably in regards to the Zerocoin\nprotocol\n[https://cryptoslate.com/zerocoin-exploit-found-zcoin-attacked-other-privacy-coins-at-risk/] \n(Zerocoin, PIVX, Veil, etc) which had to be disabled on the affected coins.\nThere has been a similar bug on Monero and some of its forks\n[https://www.getmonero.org/2017/05/17/disclosure-of-a-major-bug-in-cryptonote-based-currencies.html] \nwhich would have allowed an attacker to create an unlimited amount of coins\nwithout ever being able to detect it. Luckily, this has never been exploited and\nthe bug has been fixed a long time before. Imagine thousands upon thousands of\ncoins being generated out of thin air without anyone being able to detect it…\n\nMaking Cold Staking Private Without the Security Concessions\n)But, again, considering the great privacy protocols available on the Particl\nnetwork (Confidential Transactions (CT) and RingCT), there really shouldn’t be\nany reason why staking privately shouldn’t be possible. And this is where the\nPrivate Cold Staking script comes into action.\n\nThe Private Cold Staking script is a script coded by Particl’s Community\nManager, Guillaume Benayoun. It allows you to automatically anonymize your\nstaking rewards using RingCT. This means you can now safely cold stake your\ncoins and remain anonymous on the network.\n\nBecause the script doesn’t operate at the protocol level, it can provide a very\npowerful level of privacy without compromising on the security side of things.\nTo be clear, with this script, Particl Proof-of-Stake remains untouched. The\nprivacy aspect of things is granted by the Private Cold Staking script itself.\n\nWhat it Can and Can’t Do\nThe Private Cold Staking script is intended to be used as a companion tool to\nthe Partyman cold staking app. It has to be used directly on your cold staking\nnode and uses entropy to obfuscate patterns\n[https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking/blob/master/README.md], thus\nincreasing the level of privacy. This script allows you to do three things:\n\n * Automatically anonymize your staking rewards and send them to a public\n   address of your choice\n * Automatically anonymize your staking rewards and send them to a blind (CT)\n   address of your choice\n * Automatically anonymize your staking rewards and send them to an anon (RingCT\n   ) address of your choice\n\nThe Private Cold Staking cannot, however, stake funds held on stealth addresses\n(blind or anon balances).\n\n> Note: Due to the nature of the script, a few coins will be held on your cold\nstaking node for a small amount of time (under 24 hours). It is not recommended\nto use this script if your staking environment isn’t safe (i.e. shared computer,\nuntrustworthy VPS, etc).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to Use the Private Cold Staking Script\n * Download the script on your cold staking node\n   cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking.git\n * Navigate to the script’s directory\n   cd Private-Coldstaking/\n * Execute the script and go through the setup process\n   bash privatecoldstaking.sh\n * Make sure everything is set up properly\n   bash update.sh\n * If you wish to uninstall the script, run the uninstaller\n   bash uninstall.sh\n\nFor more information, refer directly to the script’s README file\n[https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking/blob/master/README.md] on Github.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Private Cold Staking script takes Particl Proof-of-Stake to the next level\nby enabling solid privacy options without sacrificing any of its security. It is\ndirectly in line with Particl’s commitment to both security and privacy. Since\nit will create more anon outputs that can then be used by the network to better\nanonymize other RingCT transactions, it directly contributes to improving the\noverall privacy of the network.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Time to protect your finances and reclaim your\nprivacy! ?","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Private-Cold-Staking-Script-Released/1-zeOzkM2eQLG3Nsd6TbzY_w.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"anonymizing-your-staking-rewards-with-ringct-\">Anonymizing Your Staking Rewards With RingCT ?</h3><p>Particl is proud to announce the release of a private cold staking script on Github.

This release has been a historic moment for the project and\na huge stepping stone for the upcoming eCommerce revolution that Particl is\nbrewing up.\n\nParticl’s Open Marketplace Live on Mainnet ?Since that time, the team has\ncertainly not been taking it slow. No, it’s instead been carefully monitoring\nthe community for feedback and comments regarding the overall user experience of\nthis first live version of the marketplace and has started working on several\nfeatures that are soon going to make their way onto the marketplace. It’s\nimportant to remind ourselves that this version of the Open Marketplace is an\nearly Beta version and is in no way the “end” of anything for Particl. Quite to\nthe contrary, it is the beginning of a great journey in disrupting one of the\nbiggest economic sector of the world— the eCommerce sector.\n\nIt’s been mentioned in the past that, as the Open Marketplace goes live on\nmainnet, it would signify a gradual change of phase for the project. Whereas\nParticl used to be almost exclusively focused on development, getting a live\nproduct means user adoption will now play a more important role. After all, this\nproject has always been about building a product that people could use to\naddress real-world issues. It has always been about creating a solution that\nempowers individuals and enables businesses to reach their full potential. And\nnow that the solution is here, it’s time to get people to use it and benefit\nfrom its groundbreaking technology.\n\nNow it’s Adoption Time!\nEver since the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace, the Particl team has\nreceived a huge amount of feedback and comments about the overall user\nexperience. And it is this user experience, the feeling you get when using the\nmarketplace, that is critical in getting new people and businesses to use\nParticl. It is one of the key factors in determining the “user conversion rate”,\nor the number of people that become recurring users after trying out the\nmarketplace for the first time.\n\nIndeed, getting new people to try out the marketplace is one thing, but\nretaining them as users is a whole other story. Most of the time, people are\nmore than willing to sacrifice their data and even pay higher prices if the user\nexperience is better elsewhere. And besides, you also get one chance at first\nimpressions.\n\nFor this reason, the new Open Marketplace development roadmap will now be\nheavily focused on building what needs to be done to make the user experience as\ngood and as accessible as possible. In other words, each new marketplace feature\nreleased within the next few weeks and months will directly contribute in making\nthe user experience better, thus increasing the user conversion rate and\nallowing more sellers and buyers to be onboarded.\n\nWhat are the Current Barriers to Entry\nSince the ultimate goal of the Open Marketplace is to empower individuals and\nbusinesses on a global scale, it’s important to identify what are the current\nbarriers to entry for anyone to start using the marketplace. After that, it’s\ncrucial to identify what can be done about it and then act on it.\n\nBy definition, a barrier to entry is an obstacle or hindrance that makes it hard\nto adopt a new product. This obstacle can be a technological challenge,\ndifficult government regulations, a steep financial cost, a lack of education\nabout a topic, and etc. In the Open Marketplace’s case, the barriers to entry\nare mostly technological, financial, and educational.\n\nThat much is made quite obvious when you start to go over the list of the most\nreported issues, comments, and feedback regarding the user experience of the\nmarketplace since it’s been released on mainnet. When all summarized, most of it\ncan be boiled down to a few main barriers to entry that makes it a bit\nchallenging for buyers and sellers to adopt the platform. Some of the most\nreported user experience issues include:\n\n * The setup process of the marketplace (it has to be manually enabled) could be\n   improved (technological barrier)\n * Listing fees being too high for large-scale sellers (financial barrier)\n * The double deposit MAD escrow requires a security deposit from both sides \n   (financial barrier)\n * There is no branding or identification option for vendors (technological\n   barrier)\n * The marketplace currently only accepts the PART coin and not Bitcoin, other\n   cryptocurrencies, or more traditional means of payment (technological\n   barrier)\n * The entire blockchain and SMSG network needs to be synced, which takes a few\n   minutes to do (technological barrier)\n * What needs to be done to complete a certain action isn’t always perfectly\n   clear (educational barrier)\n * How funds move throughout a full transaction process (educational barrier)\n\nThese barriers to entry are the main obstacles that make it harder for Particl\nto be adopted to a wider level. As such, solutions to these issues will be\nprioritized moving forward, and each item contained within the Open Marketplace\ndevelopment roadmap for the next few months is designed to increase the adoption\nof the Open Marketplace by improving the user experience.\n\nMake Particl as Accessible as Any Other Marketplace\nTo eliminate the barriers that make the Open Marketplace hard to adopt for most\npeople, the Particl team has planned and started working on several improvements\nand features. Each of them is designed to feed off each other and directly\ncontribute to improving Particl’s user experience for both buyers and sellers.\n\nWhat follows is an estimated release timeline of the next few features that are\ngoing to make their way onto Particl’s Open Marketplace. There’s currently no\ndate or time estimate associated with any of these features, but they’re what’s\nbeing worked on at this moment and what is planned to be released in the short\nto mid-term.\n\n> Note: This development timeline is only an estimation of the order at which\nfeatures will be released live on mainnet. All listed items are subject to\nchange.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Coming Up for Particl?\n * User Interface Tweaks\n * Lowering Marketplace Fees\n * Product Import Tool (1)\n * Q&A Section — Ask a Question to a Seller (2)\n * Particl Desktop Settings Page (3)\n * Market Management Tool (4)\n * Adjustable Escrow Ratio (5)\n * Inventory and Quantity Management Tool (6)\n * Then What?\n   Alternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments\n   Mobile Application\n   Developer SDK Tools\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUser Interface Tweaks\nImproved Sell Orders Page (Work-in-Progress)The lowest hanging fruit for\nimpoving Particl’s user experience is by making several tweaks to the user\ninterface of Particl Desktop, the client on which the Open Marketplace is\nhosted. These tweaks are currently being worked on based on user feedback and\nwill make using Particl much easier, especially for those who haven’t used it in\nthe past. These improvements and additions will also display more information to\nbuyers and sellers, making it easier to track what’s happening within the client\n(i.e. why funds are moving around, or at what time has a certain transaction\nbeen locked into escrow, and etc).\n\nLowering Marketplace Fees\nOne of the most reported issue with the Open Marketplace is the cost of listing\nan item. As the marketplace is fully autonomous and isn’t being operated by any\nthird-party, it charges no commission, subscription, payment processing, or\nescrow fee at all. It does, however, charge a small listing fee to fight off\nspam on the network.\n\nIn fact, when listing an item, the network usually charges sellers with a few\ncents worth of PART every day. And while it isn’t that big of a deal for any\nseller making a few sales here and there on their listings, especially given the\nfact that no commission is being charged on top of sales, it can quickly add up\nfor some of the smaller scale vendors who struggle to make sales and sellers\nwith huge inventories (hundreds/thousands of listings).\n\nAdjusting Marketplace Listing Fees on the Partyman AppFortunately, you can\nactually contribute to making this listing fee smaller. The Particl team has\npublished on their blog a full tutorial\n[https://particl.news/adjusting-listing-fees-4b676e230601] on how to instruct\nyour staking node to broadcast a request for lower fees to the SMSG network.\nSMSG is the network on which marketplace-related content is published and\nhosted.\n\nAdditionally, the Particl team is in the process of improving and optimizing the\nSMSG network. It is estimated that the marketplace fees (i.e. listing fees) will\nsignificantly be lowered due to the more effective SMSG codebase.\n\nThese changes will come gradually within the Beta phase of development of the\nmarketplace as updates get pushed.\n\nProduct Import Tool\nProduct Import Tool (Work-in-Progress)One of the key components of a two-sided\nmarketplace is getting a good amount of sellers and listed products. This is why\nthe new Particl Open Marketplace roadmap for the next few months includes a lot\nof tools that will make it easier for sellers to adopt the platform.\n\nOne such tool is the Product Import tool. This tool allows vendors to quickly\nimport large inventories from other sources, considerably reducing the time it\ntakes to populate the marketplace when holding custody of large inventories.\nWithout this feature, sellers need to manually add listings one by one, which is\na very time-consuming process.\n\nWith this feature in place, sellers are going to be able to import and list\nlarge inventories with only a few clicks. Outside sources for inventory\nimportation will include WooCommerce stores and CSV files (spreadsheets). More\noptions are very likely to be added in the future.\n\nQ&A Section — Ask a Question to a Seller\nBut a two-sided marketplace being a two-sided marketplace, it also needs a good\namount of buyers so that it can reach its full potential. This is where the\nupcoming Q&A section comes into play.\n\nThis “comment section” will allow anyone to ask questions to vendors before\npurchasing (or flagging) a product. This isn’t unlike the very popular Q&A\nsection that Amazon has had for some time now, and it goes a great way into\ngiving you information that might be missing from the item’s description.\n\nThis feature, while not a direct line of contact with the seller, will help\nbuyers make more informed purchasing decisions and give a little bit more\nconfidence when buying an item from a complete stranger. The more you know, the\nbetter decisions one can make.\n\nParticl Desktop Settings Page\nThe Particl Desktop Settings page is a no-brainer. Currently, if you want to\nchange a configuration on your Particl Desktop client, you either have to modify\nsome config file or enter some command inside the console. This works, but since\nthe goal is to make Particl’s user experience as good as possible, it’s\ndefinitely not as user-friendly as it should be.\n\nThe Settings page is pretty much what you would expect from a…settings page. It\nallows you to change various preferences without having to go through the hassle\nof finding a tutorial on how to find and modify a config file, or find a list of\ncommands to enter in the console.\n\nMarket Management Tool\nThe Market Management tool is one of the most awaited features of the Open\nMarketplace, and rightly so. It is what’s going to make all the individual\npieces of the marketplace click together and form into a giant distributed\nnetwork of markets.\n\nSelect What Market (or Storefront) to Browse (Work-in-Progress)Market Management\nwill allow you to either create a market of your own or connect your client to a\npre-existing one. These community markets can be created by anyone and are\ncompletely independent of the main interface of the Open Marketplace. In fact,\nthey are powered by completely different sets of market keys, meaning no data\ncan be shared between the different markets. It’s like multi-wallets, but more\nadvanced and for markets.\n\nOn Particl, there are two types of markets: community markets, and storefronts.\n\nCommunity Markets: They are markets on which anyone that has access to it can\nbuy or sell goods and services. They function exactly the same as the main\ninterface of the Open Marketplace, and nobody has any special permission over\nother users. Not even the market creator. These markets, however, are not\nenabled nor visible by default. To access these markets, you need to connect\nyour Particl Desktop client to its Market ID.\n\n> Note: The main interface of the Open Marketplace is a community market that’s\nenabled and displayed by default by the Particl Desktop client.\nJoined Markets (and Storefronts) Page (Work-in-Progress)Storefronts: They are customizable community markets on which special\npermissions can be attributed to various users. In their most common sense, they\nare storefronts on which a seller can “set up a shop” in such a way that only\nhim (or the people he gives administrator rights to) can publish listings.\nAnyone with access to a storefront can only buy (or flag) the listings put on\nthere by the owner of the storefront. Storefronts can also be used by\ncommunities looking for higher standards in quality on which only vetted sellers\ncould publish listings.\n\n> Note: By default, Particl Desktop has no way to automatically find Market IDs on\nthe network. These keys need to be distributed manually by whoever wants people\nto interact with a certain market or storefront…unless these markets/storefronts\nget promoted.\nPromote a Market or Storefront (Work-in-Progress)While Particl Desktop cannot\nautomatically scan and detect community markets, it is still possible to promote\nyour market to the network, for a fee. When “promoting” your market (or\nstorefront), your Particl Desktop client broadcasts the Market ID of your market\nto the network using SMSG. It is then picked up by the other clients connected\nto the Particl network, and is added to a “market browser”. At this point, a\nmarket will act just like a listing. It will show up on the market browser for\nthe amount of time it’s been promoted. Once the promotion period ends, the\nmarket disappears from the market browser.\n\n> Note: Once a market or storefront disappears from the market browser, it is\nstill accessible to anyone with its Market ID. The only difference is that it\nwon’t be publicly accessible from the market browser itself.\nAnyone with the proper Market IDs of a market or storefront can promote it. All\nthe fees paid to bump/promote community markets are, just like the listing fees,\nredistributed to stakers.\n\nCreate a New Storefront With Logo (Work-in-Progress)Storefronts are ideal for\nsellers with an already established reputation. It allows them to guarantee to\ntheir customer base that a given market, thus all products published inside of\nit, belongs to him. This can easily be done by, for example, displaying the\nMarket ID of the storefront on the seller’s official website.\n\nAdditionally, storefronts allow for a minimal amount of customization/branding\n(logo, store description, store title) and aggregate all the listings of a\nvendor to a single point of access This makes it easier and quicker for\ncustomers to find what they’re looking for, when they need it.\n\nAdjustable Escrow Ratio\nAs it stands right now, Particl’s double deposit MAD escrow system only works\nusing a 100% ratio, meaning both parties need to deposit a security deposit\nequal to 100% of the value of the item or service being purchased. There’s\nnothing wrong with that, of course. After all, a 100% ratio does provide the\nbest game-theory for this type of escrow. There might, however, be some\ncircumstances where such an escrow system wouldn’t be ideal.\n\nTake the example of a well-known seller that’s already trusted by its customer\nbase and runs a storefront on Particl. This seller might want to move some of\nits inventory on Particl to save on fees and improve the level of privacy for\nhis business as well as his customers. But since that seller is already\nwell-known and has an established customer base, it might not be ideal for both\nthe seller and its customer to front funds in order to cover a double deposit\nMAD escrow smart-contract. There is already trust that’s been established\nbetween the two parties and, since the seller is running a Particl storefront,\nhe can prove ownership of the products being offered simply by spreading his\nMarket ID on his website or social media pages. In that situation, the required\nsecurity deposits become an unnecessary obstacle for both the seller and the\nbuyer as they do not necessarily require, or want, escrow protection for\ntransactions.\n\nWhat an adjustable escrow would mean is that vendors could set up their own\nescrow ratio preferences from 0% to 100%. In the above example of a well-known\nseller running a Particl storefront, he could just reduce his escrow ratio to\n0%, meaning no security deposit would be required from neither the buyer or the\nvendor. This, of course, means that buyers would have no recourse against a\ndishonest seller, but for those already-established sellers with an existing\ncustomer base, having the opportunity to not have to advance coins to fund the\nescrow system would make adopting Particl’s Open Marketplace much more of a\nno-brainer.\n\nInventory and Quantity Management Tool\nThis feature is self-explanatory. There is no way, currently, to manage a wide\ninventory and add quantities to your listing. Fortunately, the marketplace\nback-end currently allows for most of it, but it hasn’t been integrated into the\nOpen Marketplace just yet. Note that a relatively fair amount of development is\nstill needed around this feature and it is likely to be released after the\nMarket Management tool.\n\nThis tool, like its name implies, allows vendors to easily manage inventory\nquantities, manage multiple listings, and etc. Just like the Product Import\ntool, Inventory Management is going to make it way easier for sellers with large\ninventories to take the leap and get started selling on Particl without it being\na big hassle.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThen What?\nAll of the above-mentioned items are placed into a short to mid-term roadmap,\nmeaning they are likely to be released within the next few weeks and months,\ndepending on the feature. But wait, there’s more to it!\n\nThe Particl team is thinking ahead and has already planned and started doing\nresearch on the features that are going to be worked on once the above\nmarketplace development roadmap is completed.\n\nAlternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments\nOne of the barriers to entry for Particl’s Open Marketplace currently is that it\nonly works with PART, Particl’s native privacy coin. This, of course, is due to\nthe nature of the technology and how the marketplace has to use PART for its\nprivacy and smart-contract capabilities\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd]. If it\nwere using Bitcoin, not only would transactions take a considerably longer time\ndue to longer confirmations, but the marketplace wouldn’t be able to offer a\nprivate-by-default experience to its users. And if it were using Monero, it\nwould be okay on the privacy side of things, but then the coin couldn’t be used\nwithin smart-contracts. The PART coin is a next-generation privacy coin that\nhas\nboth a solid privacy scheme and a flexible codebase\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd] which\nallows it to be used within smart-contracts. As far as privacy coins come, it’s\npretty much getting your cake and eating it too! The good stuff…without the\nlimitations.\n\nBut in the end, people want an easy-to-use marketplace with good user\nexperience, and only accepting PART severely limits the number of new users that\ncan be onboarded (that’s because everybody uses Bitcoin, mostly). To address\nthis issue, the Particl team is going to be working on integrating alternative\nmethods of payments, like paying with Bitcoin, for example.\n\nThere are a couple of ways this can be done, either through an atomic swap\nwidget or by integrating a third-party partner. And while the Particl team would\nlike to use an atomic swap solution (research and development on the matter is\nongoing at this very moment), a third-party integration might have to be coded\nin until an atomic swap application is fully ready (and thoroughly tested) to\ngo. There are currently investigations going into this question specifically,\nand so more details will be able to be communicated in the future.\n\nIt’s important to note though that, regardless of the method chosen to accept\ndifferent payment methods, the PART coin will always be the coin that settles\nthe transaction in the end. That’s because even though Particl’s Open\nMarketplace would be accepting Bitcoin, the marketplace Dapp still needs PART to\noperate as it is the coin that gives it its privacy and smart-contract\ncapabilities. This means any non-PART payments will be automatically converted\ninto a PART transaction, in the background, on behalf of the user. The end\nresult is that the buyer pays with Bitcoin, and the Open Marketplace does all\nthe rest, transferring the Bitcoin into Particl to fuel the escrow contract.\n\nMobile Application\nAnother very important upcoming feature is a Particl Open Marketplace mobile\napplication. Indeed, most people now shop on their cellphones, which means\ndownloading a software that requires you to sync two networks (blockchain +\nSMSG) is definitely a downgrade in terms of user experience. Sure, it provides\nway better privacy and decentralization, but for most people, this is too weak\nof an argument against a lazy and fast user-experience.\n\nAnd so, to address this issue, the Particl team has scheduled the development of\na mobile application. Research is already being put into this item at this very\nmoment, although it is not a top priority for the team right now. That’s because\nthere are still some core features missing to the marketplace (the items in the\nabove roadmap) that need to be added before the team can think of wrapping\neverything within a mobile application. Once the above roadmap is complete or\nnear-complete, that’s when the Open Marketplace’s mobile application is going to\nbecome more of a focus.\n\nThis mobile application will make Particl as accessible as it will have ever\nbeen. In fact, most of the world uses cellphones and more and more people now\nspend more time on their phone than on their computer. To make sure the\napplication has good performance and setup speed, it is more than likely to be a\n“light wallet”, meaning it won’t require you to download the entire blockchain\nand SMSG network to function. In other words, this application is intended to be\nas easy to use as any traditional marketplace mobile application (i.e. Amazon’s\napplication).\n\nDeveloper SDK Tools\nWith bringing more people within the Particl ecosystem in mind, the team has\nplanned for the release of an SDK tool. This tool will be accompanied by various\ntechnical documentation that is now currently missing. This will allow outside\ndevelopers and teams to easily start contributing to the Particl network by\ndeveloping services, decentralized applications, marketplace features, and etc.\n\nBecause the Open Marketplace is still very much into a heavy development phase,\nthis SDK tool is likely to be one of the last items of this article to see the\nday. With this in mind, the SDK tool will be going live once the Particl code\ngets “stable enough” so that it makes sense to commit to a version and write\ndocumentation on it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet’s Wrap it Up\nAll of the above-mentioned features that are going to be added to Particl have\none thing in common — they are part of a bigger puzzle that’s gonna make the\nOpen Marketplace much more accessible and easy to use for everyone. They all\ncontribute to eliminate the current barriers to entry that makes adopting\nParticl more complicated for most people.\n\nOnce in place, these should take Particl to the next level, making it a much\nmore credible contender for mainstream adoption. In the meantime, Particl\npioneers such as you can still buy and sell anything for crypto, without leaving\na trace, using the current version of the Open Marketplace. And since the\nmarketplace is now live on mainnet, new features and improvements can be\nexpected to come out at an accelerated pace!\n\nParticl is now well on its way on the path towards mainstream adoption. The\ndevelopment team is now a well-oiled machine and is excited to enter this new\nphase for the Particl project. The base layer is there, now it’s all about\nputting the last pieces to the puzzle together. This is where it gets exciting\nand when it starts moving faster!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-r41YvsRXOJyeVDkN_GcTqg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"new-marketplace-development-update-roadmap\">New Marketplace Development Update &amp; Roadmap</h3><p>It has now been more than 2 weeks since the Particl Open Marketplace has launched on mainnet. This release has been a historic moment for the project and a huge stepping stone for the upcoming eCommerce revolution that Particl is brewing up.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-QjorfnMkAgAxEXVbGdPndw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl’s Open Marketplace Live on Mainnet ?</figcaption></figure><p>Since that time, the team has certainly not been taking it slow. No, it’s instead been carefully monitoring the community for feedback and comments regarding the overall user experience of this first live version of the marketplace and has started working on several features that are soon going to make their way onto the marketplace. It’s important to remind ourselves that this version of the Open Marketplace is an early Beta version and is in no way the “end” of anything for Particl. Quite to the contrary, it is the beginning of a great journey in disrupting one of the biggest economic sector of the world— the eCommerce sector.</p><p>It’s been mentioned in the past that, as the Open Marketplace goes live on mainnet, it would signify a gradual change of phase for the project. Whereas Particl used to be almost exclusively focused on development, getting a live product means user adoption will now play a more important role. After all, this project has always been about building a product that people could use to address <strong>real-world issues. </strong>It has always been about creating a solution that empowers individuals and enables businesses to reach their full potential. And now that the solution is here, it’s time to get people to use it and benefit from its groundbreaking technology.</p><h2 id=\"now-it-s-adoption-time-\">Now it’s Adoption Time!</h2><p>Ever since the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace, the Particl team has received a huge amount of feedback and comments about the overall user experience. And it is this user experience, the feeling you get when using the marketplace, that is critical in getting new people and businesses to use Particl. It is one of the key factors in determining the “user conversion rate”, or the number of people that become recurring users after trying out the marketplace for the first time.</p><p>Indeed, getting new people to try out the marketplace is one thing, but retaining them as users is a whole other story. Most of the time, people are more than willing to sacrifice their data and even pay higher prices if the user experience is better elsewhere. And besides, you also get one chance at first impressions.</p><p>For this reason, <strong>the new Open Marketplace development roadmap will now be heavily focused on building what needs to be done to make the user experience as good and as accessible as possible. </strong>In other words, each new marketplace feature released within the next few weeks and months will directly contribute in making the user experience better, thus increasing the user conversion rate and allowing more sellers and buyers to be onboarded.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-current-barriers-to-entry\">What are the Current Barriers to Entry</h2><p>Since the ultimate goal of the Open Marketplace is to empower individuals and businesses on a global scale, it’s important to identify what are the current barriers to entry for anyone to start using the marketplace. After that, it’s crucial to identify what can be done about it and then act on it.</p><p>By definition, a barrier to entry is an obstacle or hindrance that makes it hard to adopt a new product. This obstacle can be a technological challenge, difficult government regulations, a steep financial cost, a lack of education about a topic, and etc. In the Open Marketplace’s case, the barriers to entry are mostly <strong>technological</strong>, <strong>financial</strong>, and<strong> educational</strong>.</p><p>That much is made quite obvious when you start to go over the list of the most reported issues, comments, and feedback regarding the user experience of the marketplace since it’s been released on mainnet. When all summarized, most of it can be boiled down to a few main barriers to entry that makes it a bit challenging for buyers and sellers to adopt the platform. Some of the most reported user experience issues include:</p><ul><li>The setup process of the marketplace (it has to be manually enabled) could be improved <strong>(technological barrier)</strong></li><li>Listing fees being too high for large-scale sellers <strong>(financial barrier)</strong></li><li>The double deposit MAD escrow requires a security deposit from both sides <strong>(financial barrier)</strong></li><li>There is no branding or identification option for vendors <strong>(technological barrier)</strong></li><li>The marketplace currently only accepts the PART coin and not Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, or more traditional means of payment <strong>(technological barrier)</strong></li><li>The entire blockchain and SMSG network needs to be synced, which takes a few minutes to do<strong> (technological barrier)</strong></li><li>What needs to be done to complete a certain action isn’t always perfectly clear <strong>(educational barrier)</strong></li><li>How funds move throughout a full transaction process <strong>(educational barrier)</strong></li></ul><p>These barriers to entry are the main obstacles that make it harder for Particl to be adopted to a wider level. As such, solutions to these issues will be prioritized moving forward, and each item contained within the Open Marketplace development roadmap for the next few months is designed to increase the adoption of the Open Marketplace by improving the user experience.</p><h2 id=\"make-particl-as-accessible-as-any-other-marketplace\">Make Particl as Accessible as Any Other Marketplace</h2><p>To eliminate the barriers that make the Open Marketplace hard to adopt for most people, the Particl team has planned and started working on several improvements and features. Each of them is designed to feed off each other and directly contribute to improving Particl’s user experience for both buyers and sellers.</p><p>What follows is an estimated release timeline of the next few features that are going to make their way onto Particl’s Open Marketplace. There’s currently no date or time estimate associated with any of these features, but they’re what’s being worked on at this moment and what is planned to be released in the short to mid-term.</p><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>This development timeline is only an estimation of the order at which features will be released live on mainnet. All listed items are subject to change.</blockquote><hr><h3 id=\"what-s-coming-up-for-particl\">What’s Coming Up for Particl?</h3><ul><li><a href=\"#8c5a\"><strong>User Interface Tweaks</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"#5f27\"><strong>Lowering Marketplace Fees</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"#909d\"><strong>Product Import Tool</strong></a><strong> (1)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#3d73\"><strong>Q&amp;A Section — Ask a Question to a Seller</strong></a><strong> (2)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#c8cb\"><strong>Particl Desktop Settings Page</strong></a><strong> (3)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#7168\"><strong>Market Management Tool</strong></a><strong> (4)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#e90f\"><strong>Adjustable Escrow Ratio</strong></a><strong> (5)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#3d2b\"><strong>Inventory and Quantity Management Tool</strong></a><strong> (6)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#5a71\"><strong>Then What?</strong></a><br><a href=\"#a7e1\">Alternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments</a><br><a href=\"#c75e\">Mobile Application</a><br><a href=\"#9733\">Developer SDK Tools</a></li></ul><hr><h3 id=\"user-interface-tweaks\">User Interface Tweaks</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-ZdZYzwxy3xJGIyMnGSbIwQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Improved Sell Orders Page (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>The lowest hanging fruit for impoving Particl’s user experience is by making several tweaks to the user interface of Particl Desktop, the client on which the Open Marketplace is hosted. These tweaks are currently being worked on based on user feedback and will make using Particl much easier, especially for those who haven’t used it in the past. These improvements and additions will also display more information to buyers and sellers, making it easier to track what’s happening within the client (i.e. why funds are moving around, or at what time has a certain transaction been locked into escrow, and etc).</p><h3 id=\"lowering-marketplace-fees\">Lowering Marketplace Fees</h3><p>One of the most reported issue with the Open Marketplace is the cost of listing an item. As the marketplace is fully autonomous and isn’t being operated by any third-party, it charges no commission, subscription, payment processing, or escrow fee at all. It does, however, charge a small listing fee to fight off spam on the network.</p><p>In fact, when listing an item, the network usually charges sellers with a few cents worth of PART every day. And while it isn’t that big of a deal for any seller making a few sales here and there on their listings, especially given the fact that no commission is being charged on top of sales, it can quickly add up for some of the smaller scale vendors who struggle to make sales and sellers with huge inventories (hundreds/thousands of listings).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-OLpQIvxuczEzoa_flsWpfw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Adjusting Marketplace Listing Fees on the Partyman App</figcaption></figure><p>Fortunately, you can actually contribute to making this listing fee smaller. <a href=\"https://particl.news/adjusting-listing-fees-4b676e230601\"><strong>The Particl team has published on their blog a full tutorial</strong></a> on how to instruct your staking node to broadcast a request for lower fees to the SMSG network. SMSG is the network on which marketplace-related content is published and hosted.</p><p>Additionally, the Particl team is in the process of improving and optimizing the SMSG network. It is estimated that the marketplace fees (i.e. listing fees) will significantly be lowered due to the more effective SMSG codebase.</p><p>These changes will come gradually within the Beta phase of development of the marketplace as updates get pushed.</p><h3 id=\"product-import-tool\">Product Import Tool</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-nV8MXWfbGAStemdjRDT_EQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Product Import Tool (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>One of the key components of a two-sided marketplace is getting a good amount of sellers and listed products. This is why the new Particl Open Marketplace roadmap for the next few months includes a lot of tools that will make it easier for sellers to adopt the platform.</p><p>One such tool is the Product Import tool. This tool allows vendors to quickly import large inventories from other sources, considerably reducing the time it takes to populate the marketplace when holding custody of large inventories. Without this feature, sellers need to manually add listings one by one, which is a very time-consuming process.</p><p>With this feature in place, sellers are going to be able to import and list large inventories with only a few clicks. Outside sources for inventory importation will include WooCommerce stores and CSV files (spreadsheets). More options are very likely to be added in the future.</p><h3 id=\"qa-section-ask-a-question-to-a-seller\">Q&amp;A Section — Ask a Question to a Seller</h3><p>But a two-sided marketplace being a two-sided marketplace, it also needs a good amount of buyers so that it can reach its full potential. This is where the upcoming Q&amp;A section comes into play.</p><p>This “comment section” will allow anyone to ask questions to vendors before purchasing (or flagging) a product. This isn’t unlike the very popular Q&amp;A section that Amazon has had for some time now, and it goes a great way into giving you information that might be missing from the item’s description.</p><p>This feature, while not a direct line of contact with the seller, will help buyers make more informed purchasing decisions and give a little bit more confidence when buying an item from a complete stranger. The more you know, the better decisions one can make.</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-settings-page\">Particl Desktop Settings Page</h3><p>The Particl Desktop Settings page is a no-brainer. Currently, if you want to change a configuration on your Particl Desktop client, you either have to modify some config file or enter some command inside the console. This works, but since the goal is to make Particl’s user experience as good as possible, it’s definitely not as user-friendly as it should be.</p><p>The Settings page is pretty much what you would expect from a…settings page. It allows you to change various preferences without having to go through the hassle of finding a tutorial on how to find and modify a config file, or find a list of commands to enter in the console.</p><h3 id=\"market-management-tool\">Market Management Tool</h3><p>The Market Management tool is one of the most awaited features of the Open Marketplace, and rightly so. It is what’s going to make all the individual pieces of the marketplace click together and form into a giant distributed network of markets.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-sQWfEk-U6lWzv8ijSfJBng.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Select What Market (or Storefront) to Browse (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>Market Management will allow you to either create a market of your own or connect your client to a pre-existing one. These community markets can be created by anyone and are completely independent of the main interface of the Open Marketplace. In fact, they are powered by completely different sets of market keys, meaning no data can be shared between the different markets. It’s like multi-wallets, but more advanced and for markets.</p><p>On Particl, there are two types of markets: community markets, and storefronts.</p><p><strong>Community Markets:</strong> They are markets on which anyone that has access to it can buy or sell goods and services. They function exactly the same as the main interface of the Open Marketplace, and nobody has any special permission over other users. Not even the market creator. These markets, however, are not enabled nor visible by default. To access these markets, you need to connect your Particl Desktop client to its Market ID.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> The main interface of the Open Marketplace is a community market that’s enabled and displayed by default by the Particl Desktop client.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-Gh6FqychOcQ2f49d-D_laA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Joined Markets (and Storefronts) Page (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Storefronts: </strong>They are customizable community markets on which special permissions can be attributed to various users. In their most common sense, they are storefronts on which a seller can “set up a shop” in such a way that only him (or the people he gives administrator rights to) can publish listings. Anyone with access to a storefront can only buy (or flag) the listings put on there by the owner of the storefront. Storefronts can also be used by communities looking for higher standards in quality on which only vetted sellers could publish listings.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> By default, Particl Desktop has no way to automatically find Market IDs on the network.

There’s nothing wrong with that, of course. After all, a 100% ratio does provide the best game-theory for this type of escrow. There might, however, be some circumstances where such an escrow system wouldn’t be ideal.</p><p>Take the example of a well-known seller that’s already trusted by its customer base and runs a storefront on Particl. This seller might want to move some of its inventory on Particl to save on fees and improve the level of privacy for his business as well as his customers. But since that seller is already well-known and has an established customer base, it might not be ideal for both the seller and its customer to front funds in order to cover a double deposit MAD escrow smart-contract. There is already trust that’s been established between the two parties and, since the seller is running a Particl storefront, he can prove ownership of the products being offered simply by spreading his Market ID on his website or social media pages. In that situation, the required security deposits become an unnecessary obstacle for both the seller and the buyer as they do not necessarily require, or want, escrow protection for transactions.</p><p>What an adjustable escrow would mean is that vendors could set up their own escrow ratio preferences from 0% to 100%. In the above example of a well-known seller running a Particl storefront, he could just reduce his escrow ratio to 0%, meaning no security deposit would be required from neither the buyer or the vendor. This, of course, means that buyers would have no recourse against a dishonest seller, but for those already-established sellers with an existing customer base, having the opportunity to not have to advance coins to fund the escrow system would make adopting Particl’s Open Marketplace much more of a no-brainer.</p><h3 id=\"inventory-and-quantity-management-tool\">Inventory and Quantity Management Tool</h3><p>This feature is self-explanatory. There is no way, currently, to manage a wide inventory and add quantities to your listing. Fortunately, the marketplace back-end currently allows for most of it, but it hasn’t been integrated into the Open Marketplace just yet. Note that a relatively fair amount of development is still needed around this feature and it is likely to be released after the Market Management tool.</p><p>This tool, like its name implies, allows vendors to easily manage inventory quantities, manage multiple listings, and etc. Just like the Product Import tool, Inventory Management is going to make it way easier for sellers with large inventories to take the leap and get started selling on Particl without it being a big hassle.</p><hr><h2 id=\"then-what\"><strong>Then What?</strong></h2><p>All of the above-mentioned items are placed into a short to mid-term roadmap, meaning they are likely to be released within the next few weeks and months, depending on the feature. But wait, there’s more to it!</p><p>The Particl team is thinking ahead and has already planned and started doing research on the features that are going to be worked on once the above marketplace development roadmap is completed.</p><h3 id=\"alternative-payment-options-bitcoin-payments\">Alternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments</h3><p>One of the barriers to entry for Particl’s Open Marketplace currently is that it only works with PART, Particl’s native privacy coin. This, of course, is due to the nature of the technology and how the marketplace has to use <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>PART for its privacy and smart-contract capabilities</strong></a>. If it were using Bitcoin, not only would transactions take a considerably longer time due to longer confirmations, but the marketplace wouldn’t be able to offer a private-by-default experience to its users. And if it were using Monero, it would be okay on the privacy side of things, but then the coin couldn’t be used within smart-contracts. The <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>PART coin is a next-generation privacy coin that has both a solid privacy scheme and a flexible codebase</strong></a> which allows it to be used within smart-contracts. As far as privacy coins come, it’s pretty much getting your cake and eating it too! The good stuff…without the limitations.</p><p>But in the end, people want an easy-to-use marketplace with good user experience, and only accepting PART severely limits the number of new users that can be onboarded (that’s because everybody uses Bitcoin, mostly). To address this issue, the Particl team is going to be working on integrating alternative methods of payments, like paying with Bitcoin, for example.</p><p>There are a couple of ways this can be done, either through an atomic swap widget or by integrating a third-party partner. And while the Particl team would like to use an atomic swap solution (research and development on the matter is ongoing at this very moment), a third-party integration might have to be coded in until an atomic swap application is fully ready (and thoroughly tested) to go. There are currently investigations going into this question specifically, and so more details will be able to be communicated in the future.</p><p>It’s important to note though that, regardless of the method chosen to accept different payment methods, the PART coin will always be the coin that settles the transaction in the end. That’s because even though Particl’s Open Marketplace would be accepting Bitcoin, the marketplace Dapp still needs PART to operate as it is the coin that gives it its privacy and smart-contract capabilities. This means any non-PART payments will be automatically converted into a PART transaction, in the background, on behalf of the user. The end result is that the buyer pays with Bitcoin, and the Open Marketplace does all the rest, transferring the Bitcoin into Particl to fuel the escrow contract.</p><h3 id=\"mobile-application\">Mobile Application</h3><p>Another very important upcoming feature is a Particl Open Marketplace mobile application. Indeed, most people now shop on their cellphones, which means downloading a software that requires you to sync two networks (blockchain + SMSG) is definitely a downgrade in terms of user experience. Sure, it provides way better privacy and decentralization, but for most people, this is too weak of an argument against a lazy and fast user-experience.</p><p>And so, to address this issue, the Particl team has scheduled the development of a mobile application. Research is already being put into this item at this very moment, although it is not a top priority for the team right now. That’s because there are still some core features missing to the marketplace (the items in the above roadmap) that need to be added before the team can think of wrapping everything within a mobile application. Once the above roadmap is complete or near-complete, that’s when the Open Marketplace’s mobile application is going to become more of a focus.</p><p>This mobile application will make Particl as accessible as it will have ever been. In fact, most of the world uses cellphones and more and more people now spend more time on their phone than on their computer. To make sure the application has good performance and setup speed, it is more than likely to be a “light wallet”, meaning it won’t require you to download the entire blockchain and SMSG network to function. In other words, this application is intended to be as easy to use as any traditional marketplace mobile application (i.e. Amazon’s application).</p><h3 id=\"developer-sdk-tools\">Developer SDK Tools</h3><p>With bringing more people within the Particl ecosystem in mind, the team has planned for the release of an SDK tool. This tool will be accompanied by various technical documentation that is now currently missing. This will allow outside developers and teams to easily start contributing to the Particl network by developing services, decentralized applications, marketplace features, and etc.</p><p>Because the Open Marketplace is still very much into a heavy development phase, this SDK tool is likely to be one of the last items of this article to see the day. With this in mind, the SDK tool will be going live once the Particl code gets “stable enough” so that it makes sense to commit to a version and write documentation on it.</p><hr><h2 id=\"let-s-wrap-it-up\">Let’s Wrap it Up</h2><p>All of the above-mentioned features that are going to be added to Particl have one thing in common — they are part of a bigger puzzle that’s gonna make the Open Marketplace much more accessible and easy to use for everyone. They all contribute to eliminate the current barriers to entry that makes adopting Particl more complicated for most people.</p><p>Once in place, these should take Particl to the next level, making it a much more credible contender for mainstream adoption. In the meantime, Particl pioneers such as you can still buy and sell anything for crypto, without leaving a trace, using the current version of the Open Marketplace. And since the marketplace is now live on mainnet, new features and improvements can be expected to come out at an accelerated pace!</p><p>Particl is now well on its way on the path towards mainstream adoption. The development team is now a well-oiled machine and is excited to enter this new phase for the Particl project. The base layer is there, now it’s all about putting the last pieces to the puzzle together. This is where it gets exciting and when it starts moving faster!</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-uAgpsfe9xDDVHe1pF6zJdg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure>","url":"http://localhost:2368/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"994d687a-0700-42af-9230-d514c67d48e9","codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5f7e4ca61a93b603e3f767b2","reading_time":16,"send_email_when_published":false,"email_subject":null,"childHtmlRehype":{"html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-r41YvsRXOJyeVDkN_GcTqg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><h3 id=\"new-marketplace-development-update-roadmap\">New Marketplace Development Update &#x26; Roadmap</h3><p>It has now been more than 2 weeks since the Particl Open Marketplace has launched on mainnet. This release has been a historic moment for the project and a huge stepping stone for the upcoming eCommerce revolution that Particl is brewing up.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-QjorfnMkAgAxEXVbGdPndw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl’s Open Marketplace Live on Mainnet ?</figcaption></figure><p>Since that time, the team has certainly not been taking it slow. No, it’s instead been carefully monitoring the community for feedback and comments regarding the overall user experience of this first live version of the marketplace and has started working on several features that are soon going to make their way onto the marketplace. It’s important to remind ourselves that this version of the Open Marketplace is an early Beta version and is in no way the “end” of anything for Particl. Quite to the contrary, it is the beginning of a great journey in disrupting one of the biggest economic sector of the world— the eCommerce sector.</p><p>It’s been mentioned in the past that, as the Open Marketplace goes live on mainnet, it would signify a gradual change of phase for the project. Whereas Particl used to be almost exclusively focused on development, getting a live product means user adoption will now play a more important role. After all, this project has always been about building a product that people could use to address <strong>real-world issues. </strong>It has always been about creating a solution that empowers individuals and enables businesses to reach their full potential. And now that the solution is here, it’s time to get people to use it and benefit from its groundbreaking technology.</p><h2 id=\"now-it-s-adoption-time-\">Now it’s Adoption Time!</h2><p>Ever since the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace, the Particl team has received a huge amount of feedback and comments about the overall user experience. And it is this user experience, the feeling you get when using the marketplace, that is critical in getting new people and businesses to use Particl. It is one of the key factors in determining the “user conversion rate”, or the number of people that become recurring users after trying out the marketplace for the first time.</p><p>Indeed, getting new people to try out the marketplace is one thing, but retaining them as users is a whole other story. Most of the time, people are more than willing to sacrifice their data and even pay higher prices if the user experience is better elsewhere. And besides, you also get one chance at first impressions.</p><p>For this reason, <strong>the new Open Marketplace development roadmap will now be heavily focused on building what needs to be done to make the user experience as good and as accessible as possible. </strong>In other words, each new marketplace feature released within the next few weeks and months will directly contribute in making the user experience better, thus increasing the user conversion rate and allowing more sellers and buyers to be onboarded.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-current-barriers-to-entry\">What are the Current Barriers to Entry</h2><p>Since the ultimate goal of the Open Marketplace is to empower individuals and businesses on a global scale, it’s important to identify what are the current barriers to entry for anyone to start using the marketplace. After that, it’s crucial to identify what can be done about it and then act on it.</p><p>By definition, a barrier to entry is an obstacle or hindrance that makes it hard to adopt a new product. This obstacle can be a technological challenge, difficult government regulations, a steep financial cost, a lack of education about a topic, and etc. In the Open Marketplace’s case, the barriers to entry are mostly <strong>technological</strong>, <strong>financial</strong>, and<strong> educational</strong>.</p><p>That much is made quite obvious when you start to go over the list of the most reported issues, comments, and feedback regarding the user experience of the marketplace since it’s been released on mainnet. When all summarized, most of it can be boiled down to a few main barriers to entry that makes it a bit challenging for buyers and sellers to adopt the platform. Some of the most reported user experience issues include:</p><ul><li>The setup process of the marketplace (it has to be manually enabled) could be improved <strong>(technological barrier)</strong></li><li>Listing fees being too high for large-scale sellers <strong>(financial barrier)</strong></li><li>The double deposit MAD escrow requires a security deposit from both sides <strong>(financial barrier)</strong></li><li>There is no branding or identification option for vendors <strong>(technological barrier)</strong></li><li>The marketplace currently only accepts the PART coin and not Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, or more traditional means of payment <strong>(technological barrier)</strong></li><li>The entire blockchain and SMSG network needs to be synced, which takes a few minutes to do<strong> (technological barrier)</strong></li><li>What needs to be done to complete a certain action isn’t always perfectly clear <strong>(educational barrier)</strong></li><li>How funds move throughout a full transaction process <strong>(educational barrier)</strong></li></ul><p>These barriers to entry are the main obstacles that make it harder for Particl to be adopted to a wider level. As such, solutions to these issues will be prioritized moving forward, and each item contained within the Open Marketplace development roadmap for the next few months is designed to increase the adoption of the Open Marketplace by improving the user experience.</p><h2 id=\"make-particl-as-accessible-as-any-other-marketplace\">Make Particl as Accessible as Any Other Marketplace</h2><p>To eliminate the barriers that make the Open Marketplace hard to adopt for most people, the Particl team has planned and started working on several improvements and features. Each of them is designed to feed off each other and directly contribute to improving Particl’s user experience for both buyers and sellers.</p><p>What follows is an estimated release timeline of the next few features that are going to make their way onto Particl’s Open Marketplace. There’s currently no date or time estimate associated with any of these features, but they’re what’s being worked on at this moment and what is planned to be released in the short to mid-term.</p><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>This development timeline is only an estimation of the order at which features will be released live on mainnet. All listed items are subject to change.</blockquote><hr><h3 id=\"what-s-coming-up-for-particl\">What’s Coming Up for Particl?</h3><ul><li><a href=\"#8c5a\"><strong>User Interface Tweaks</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"#5f27\"><strong>Lowering Marketplace Fees</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"#909d\"><strong>Product Import Tool</strong></a><strong> (1)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#3d73\"><strong>Q&#x26;A Section — Ask a Question to a Seller</strong></a><strong> (2)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#c8cb\"><strong>Particl Desktop Settings Page</strong></a><strong> (3)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#7168\"><strong>Market Management Tool</strong></a><strong> (4)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#e90f\"><strong>Adjustable Escrow Ratio</strong></a><strong> (5)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#3d2b\"><strong>Inventory and Quantity Management Tool</strong></a><strong> (6)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#5a71\"><strong>Then What?</strong></a><br><a href=\"#a7e1\">Alternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments</a><br><a href=\"#c75e\">Mobile Application</a><br><a href=\"#9733\">Developer SDK Tools</a></li></ul><hr><h3 id=\"user-interface-tweaks\">User Interface Tweaks</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-ZdZYzwxy3xJGIyMnGSbIwQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Improved Sell Orders Page (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>The lowest hanging fruit for impoving Particl’s user experience is by making several tweaks to the user interface of Particl Desktop, the client on which the Open Marketplace is hosted. These tweaks are currently being worked on based on user feedback and will make using Particl much easier, especially for those who haven’t used it in the past. These improvements and additions will also display more information to buyers and sellers, making it easier to track what’s happening within the client (i.e. why funds are moving around, or at what time has a certain transaction been locked into escrow, and etc).</p><h3 id=\"lowering-marketplace-fees\">Lowering Marketplace Fees</h3><p>One of the most reported issue with the Open Marketplace is the cost of listing an item. As the marketplace is fully autonomous and isn’t being operated by any third-party, it charges no commission, subscription, payment processing, or escrow fee at all. It does, however, charge a small listing fee to fight off spam on the network.</p><p>In fact, when listing an item, the network usually charges sellers with a few cents worth of PART every day. And while it isn’t that big of a deal for any seller making a few sales here and there on their listings, especially given the fact that no commission is being charged on top of sales, it can quickly add up for some of the smaller scale vendors who struggle to make sales and sellers with huge inventories (hundreds/thousands of listings).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-OLpQIvxuczEzoa_flsWpfw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Adjusting Marketplace Listing Fees on the Partyman App</figcaption></figure><p>Fortunately, you can actually contribute to making this listing fee smaller. <a href=\"https://particl.news/adjusting-listing-fees-4b676e230601\"><strong>The Particl team has published on their blog a full tutorial</strong></a> on how to instruct your staking node to broadcast a request for lower fees to the SMSG network. SMSG is the network on which marketplace-related content is published and hosted.</p><p>Additionally, the Particl team is in the process of improving and optimizing the SMSG network. It is estimated that the marketplace fees (i.e. listing fees) will significantly be lowered due to the more effective SMSG codebase.</p><p>These changes will come gradually within the Beta phase of development of the marketplace as updates get pushed.</p><h3 id=\"product-import-tool\">Product Import Tool</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-nV8MXWfbGAStemdjRDT_EQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Product Import Tool (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>One of the key components of a two-sided marketplace is getting a good amount of sellers and listed products. This is why the new Particl Open Marketplace roadmap for the next few months includes a lot of tools that will make it easier for sellers to adopt the platform.</p><p>One such tool is the Product Import tool. This tool allows vendors to quickly import large inventories from other sources, considerably reducing the time it takes to populate the marketplace when holding custody of large inventories. Without this feature, sellers need to manually add listings one by one, which is a very time-consuming process.</p><p>With this feature in place, sellers are going to be able to import and list large inventories with only a few clicks. Outside sources for inventory importation will include WooCommerce stores and CSV files (spreadsheets). More options are very likely to be added in the future.</p><h3 id=\"qa-section-ask-a-question-to-a-seller\">Q&#x26;A Section — Ask a Question to a Seller</h3><p>But a two-sided marketplace being a two-sided marketplace, it also needs a good amount of buyers so that it can reach its full potential. This is where the upcoming Q&#x26;A section comes into play.</p><p>This “comment section” will allow anyone to ask questions to vendors before purchasing (or flagging) a product. This isn’t unlike the very popular Q&#x26;A section that Amazon has had for some time now, and it goes a great way into giving you information that might be missing from the item’s description.</p><p>This feature, while not a direct line of contact with the seller, will help buyers make more informed purchasing decisions and give a little bit more confidence when buying an item from a complete stranger. The more you know, the better decisions one can make.</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-settings-page\">Particl Desktop Settings Page</h3><p>The Particl Desktop Settings page is a no-brainer. Currently, if you want to change a configuration on your Particl Desktop client, you either have to modify some config file or enter some command inside the console. This works, but since the goal is to make Particl’s user experience as good as possible, it’s definitely not as user-friendly as it should be.</p><p>The Settings page is pretty much what you would expect from a…settings page. It allows you to change various preferences without having to go through the hassle of finding a tutorial on how to find and modify a config file, or find a list of commands to enter in the console.</p><h3 id=\"market-management-tool\">Market Management Tool</h3><p>The Market Management tool is one of the most awaited features of the Open Marketplace, and rightly so. It is what’s going to make all the individual pieces of the marketplace click together and form into a giant distributed network of markets.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-sQWfEk-U6lWzv8ijSfJBng.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Select What Market (or Storefront) to Browse (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>Market Management will allow you to either create a market of your own or connect your client to a pre-existing one. These community markets can be created by anyone and are completely independent of the main interface of the Open Marketplace. In fact, they are powered by completely different sets of market keys, meaning no data can be shared between the different markets. It’s like multi-wallets, but more advanced and for markets.</p><p>On Particl, there are two types of markets: community markets, and storefronts.</p><p><strong>Community Markets:</strong> They are markets on which anyone that has access to it can buy or sell goods and services. They function exactly the same as the main interface of the Open Marketplace, and nobody has any special permission over other users. Not even the market creator. These markets, however, are not enabled nor visible by default. To access these markets, you need to connect your Particl Desktop client to its Market ID.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> The main interface of the Open Marketplace is a community market that’s enabled and displayed by default by the Particl Desktop client.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-Gh6FqychOcQ2f49d-D_laA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Joined Markets (and Storefronts) Page (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Storefronts: </strong>They are customizable community markets on which special permissions can be attributed to various users. In their most common sense, they are storefronts on which a seller can “set up a shop” in such a way that only him (or the people he gives administrator rights to) can publish listings. Anyone with access to a storefront can only buy (or flag) the listings put on there by the owner of the storefront. Storefronts can also be used by communities looking for higher standards in quality on which only vetted sellers could publish listings.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> By default, Particl Desktop has no way to automatically find Market IDs on the network. These keys need to be distributed manually by whoever wants people to interact with a certain market or storefront…unless these markets/storefronts get promoted.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-xEOnXDjpfjoRMz-Gyasahg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Promote a Market or Storefront (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>While Particl Desktop cannot automatically scan and detect community markets, it is still possible to <strong>promote your market</strong> to the network, for a fee. When “promoting” your market (or storefront), your Particl Desktop client broadcasts the Market ID of your market to the network using SMSG. It is then picked up by the other clients connected to the Particl network, and is added to a “market browser”. At this point, a market will act just like a listing. It will show up on the market browser for the amount of time it’s been promoted. Once the promotion period ends, the market disappears from the market browser.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Once a market or storefront disappears from the market browser, it is still accessible to anyone with its Market ID. The only difference is that it won’t be publicly accessible from the market browser itself.</blockquote><p>Anyone with the proper Market IDs of a market or storefront can promote it. All the fees paid to bump/promote community markets are, just like the listing fees, redistributed to stakers.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-5utZ5LvZNv-3EOxW_ueeow.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Create a New Storefront With Logo (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>Storefronts are ideal for sellers with an already established reputation. It allows them to guarantee to their customer base that a given market, thus all products published inside of it, belongs to him. This can easily be done by, for example, displaying the Market ID of the storefront on the seller’s official website.</p><p>Additionally, storefronts allow for a minimal amount of customization/branding (logo, store description, store title) and aggregate all the listings of a vendor to a single point of access This makes it easier and quicker for customers to find what they’re looking for, when they need it.</p><h3 id=\"adjustable-escrow-ratio\">Adjustable Escrow Ratio</h3><p>As it stands right now, Particl’s double deposit MAD escrow system only works using a 100% ratio, meaning both parties need to deposit a security deposit equal to 100% of the value of the item or service being purchased. There’s nothing wrong with that, of course. After all, a 100% ratio does provide the best game-theory for this type of escrow. There might, however, be some circumstances where such an escrow system wouldn’t be ideal.</p><p>Take the example of a well-known seller that’s already trusted by its customer base and runs a storefront on Particl. This seller might want to move some of its inventory on Particl to save on fees and improve the level of privacy for his business as well as his customers. But since that seller is already well-known and has an established customer base, it might not be ideal for both the seller and its customer to front funds in order to cover a double deposit MAD escrow smart-contract. There is already trust that’s been established between the two parties and, since the seller is running a Particl storefront, he can prove ownership of the products being offered simply by spreading his Market ID on his website or social media pages. In that situation, the required security deposits become an unnecessary obstacle for both the seller and the buyer as they do not necessarily require, or want, escrow protection for transactions.</p><p>What an adjustable escrow would mean is that vendors could set up their own escrow ratio preferences from 0% to 100%. In the above example of a well-known seller running a Particl storefront, he could just reduce his escrow ratio to 0%, meaning no security deposit would be required from neither the buyer or the vendor. This, of course, means that buyers would have no recourse against a dishonest seller, but for those already-established sellers with an existing customer base, having the opportunity to not have to advance coins to fund the escrow system would make adopting Particl’s Open Marketplace much more of a no-brainer.</p><h3 id=\"inventory-and-quantity-management-tool\">Inventory and Quantity Management Tool</h3><p>This feature is self-explanatory. There is no way, currently, to manage a wide inventory and add quantities to your listing. Fortunately, the marketplace back-end currently allows for most of it, but it hasn’t been integrated into the Open Marketplace just yet. Note that a relatively fair amount of development is still needed around this feature and it is likely to be released after the Market Management tool.</p><p>This tool, like its name implies, allows vendors to easily manage inventory quantities, manage multiple listings, and etc. Just like the Product Import tool, Inventory Management is going to make it way easier for sellers with large inventories to take the leap and get started selling on Particl without it being a big hassle.</p><hr><h2 id=\"then-what\"><strong>Then What?</strong></h2><p>All of the above-mentioned items are placed into a short to mid-term roadmap, meaning they are likely to be released within the next few weeks and months, depending on the feature. But wait, there’s more to it!</p><p>The Particl team is thinking ahead and has already planned and started doing research on the features that are going to be worked on once the above marketplace development roadmap is completed.</p><h3 id=\"alternative-payment-options-bitcoin-payments\">Alternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments</h3><p>One of the barriers to entry for Particl’s Open Marketplace currently is that it only works with PART, Particl’s native privacy coin. This, of course, is due to the nature of the technology and how the marketplace has to use <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>PART for its privacy and smart-contract capabilities</strong></a>. If it were using Bitcoin, not only would transactions take a considerably longer time due to longer confirmations, but the marketplace wouldn’t be able to offer a private-by-default experience to its users. And if it were using Monero, it would be okay on the privacy side of things, but then the coin couldn’t be used within smart-contracts. The <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>PART coin is a next-generation privacy coin that has both a solid privacy scheme and a flexible codebase</strong></a> which allows it to be used within smart-contracts. As far as privacy coins come, it’s pretty much getting your cake and eating it too! The good stuff…without the limitations.</p><p>But in the end, people want an easy-to-use marketplace with good user experience, and only accepting PART severely limits the number of new users that can be onboarded (that’s because everybody uses Bitcoin, mostly). To address this issue, the Particl team is going to be working on integrating alternative methods of payments, like paying with Bitcoin, for example.</p><p>There are a couple of ways this can be done, either through an atomic swap widget or by integrating a third-party partner. And while the Particl team would like to use an atomic swap solution (research and development on the matter is ongoing at this very moment), a third-party integration might have to be coded in until an atomic swap application is fully ready (and thoroughly tested) to go. There are currently investigations going into this question specifically, and so more details will be able to be communicated in the future.</p><p>It’s important to note though that, regardless of the method chosen to accept different payment methods, the PART coin will always be the coin that settles the transaction in the end. That’s because even though Particl’s Open Marketplace would be accepting Bitcoin, the marketplace Dapp still needs PART to operate as it is the coin that gives it its privacy and smart-contract capabilities. This means any non-PART payments will be automatically converted into a PART transaction, in the background, on behalf of the user. The end result is that the buyer pays with Bitcoin, and the Open Marketplace does all the rest, transferring the Bitcoin into Particl to fuel the escrow contract.</p><h3 id=\"mobile-application\">Mobile Application</h3><p>Another very important upcoming feature is a Particl Open Marketplace mobile application. Indeed, most people now shop on their cellphones, which means downloading a software that requires you to sync two networks (blockchain + SMSG) is definitely a downgrade in terms of user experience. Sure, it provides way better privacy and decentralization, but for most people, this is too weak of an argument against a lazy and fast user-experience.</p><p>And so, to address this issue, the Particl team has scheduled the development of a mobile application. Research is already being put into this item at this very moment, although it is not a top priority for the team right now. That’s because there are still some core features missing to the marketplace (the items in the above roadmap) that need to be added before the team can think of wrapping everything within a mobile application. Once the above roadmap is complete or near-complete, that’s when the Open Marketplace’s mobile application is going to become more of a focus.</p><p>This mobile application will make Particl as accessible as it will have ever been. In fact, most of the world uses cellphones and more and more people now spend more time on their phone than on their computer. To make sure the application has good performance and setup speed, it is more than likely to be a “light wallet”, meaning it won’t require you to download the entire blockchain and SMSG network to function. In other words, this application is intended to be as easy to use as any traditional marketplace mobile application (i.e. Amazon’s application).</p><h3 id=\"developer-sdk-tools\">Developer SDK Tools</h3><p>With bringing more people within the Particl ecosystem in mind, the team has planned for the release of an SDK tool. This tool will be accompanied by various technical documentation that is now currently missing. This will allow outside developers and teams to easily start contributing to the Particl network by developing services, decentralized applications, marketplace features, and etc.</p><p>Because the Open Marketplace is still very much into a heavy development phase, this SDK tool is likely to be one of the last items of this article to see the day. With this in mind, the SDK tool will be going live once the Particl code gets “stable enough” so that it makes sense to commit to a version and write documentation on it.</p><hr><h2 id=\"let-s-wrap-it-up\">Let’s Wrap it Up</h2><p>All of the above-mentioned features that are going to be added to Particl have one thing in common — they are part of a bigger puzzle that’s gonna make the Open Marketplace much more accessible and easy to use for everyone. They all contribute to eliminate the current barriers to entry that makes adopting Particl more complicated for most people.</p><p>Once in place, these should take Particl to the next level, making it a much more credible contender for mainstream adoption. In the meantime, Particl pioneers such as you can still buy and sell anything for crypto, without leaving a trace, using the current version of the Open Marketplace. And since the marketplace is now live on mainnet, new features and improvements can be expected to come out at an accelerated pace!</p><p>Particl is now well on its way on the path towards mainstream adoption. The development team is now a well-oiled machine and is excited to enter this new phase for the Particl project. The base layer is there, now it’s all about putting the last pieces to the puzzle together. This is where it gets exciting and when it starts moving faster!</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-uAgpsfe9xDDVHe1pF6zJdg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":["kg-card","kg-image-card"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-r41YvsRXOJyeVDkN_GcTqg.jpeg","className":["kg-image"],"alt":""},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"new-marketplace-development-update-roadmap"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"New Marketplace Development Update & Roadmap"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"It has now been more than 2 weeks since the Particl Open Marketplace has launched on mainnet.

There is already trust that’s been established between the two parties and, since the seller is running a Particl storefront, he can prove ownership of the products being offered simply by spreading his Market ID on his website or social media pages.

This means any non-PART payments will be automatically converted into a PART transaction, in the background, on behalf of the user.

There is no third-party or\nintermediary operating it or having any sort of control over its network. It\nuses a mix of P2P and blockchain technologies, meaning that it is exclusively\nrun by its global community of users.\n\nThe Open Marketplace is an equally decentralized application that’s built on top\nof the Particl network. It allows anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and\nservices, physical or digital, regardless of where they are located in the\nworld. And because it is entirely decentralized, there’s no staff or support\nteam to enforce rules and policies.\n\nFurthermore, the Open Marketplace is completely private by default, meaning no\nidentifiable data can be linked to any of its users. Transactions are hidden on\nthe blockchain, images are stripped of their metadata, data exchange is\nencrypted, and you can even connect the marketplace through the Tor network. In\nother words, users of the marketplace are anonymous.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started\nTo download the Particl Open Marketplace, go to https://particl.io/downloads or \nget it directly from Github\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.0.1].\n\nparticl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.0.1]\nYou can't perform that action at this time.

If you have ever run the Particl Open Marketplace on mainnet before, you\n    will need to wipe your existing marketplace database, otherwise, you may\n    encounter errors that will break your experience. The location of your\n    particl-market is dependent on the OS you use.\n\n * Windows:C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Roaming\\particl-market\n * macOS:~/Library/Application Support/particl-market\n * Linux:~/.particl-market\n\n2. To use the marketplace, you need to create a marketplace-enabled wallet. To\ndo that, you need to first create a normal wallet as usual. Then, once that is\ndone, create a second wallet and name in Market. Once generated, that wallet\nwill have the marketplace enabled.\n\nFor a complete tutorial on how to download, install, and setup the Particl Open\nMarketplace, follow this link: \nhttps://particl.news/tutorial-how-to-use-the-private-and-trustless-particl-marketplace-11839ea30e09\n\nFor a Wiki version, follow this link: \nhttps://particl.wiki/prepare-install-marketplace\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to Use the Open Marketplace\nAlthough the Particl Open Marketplace proposes a new and improved way to shop\nand do business online, it isn’t too different than the marketplaces you’re used\nto use.\n\nFor buyers and sellers, the simple process of going through a transaction can be\nsummarized as follow:\n\n * The buyer places an order\n * The seller accepts the order\n * The buyer locks his funds in escrow\n * The seller locks his funds in escrow\n * The seller packages and ships the order. A tracking number can be included at\n   this point\n * The buyer receives the order, inspects it, and marks the transaction as\n   complete\n\nSounds easy? That’s because it is! In fact, the process of purchasing and\nselling something online without sacrificing your data shouldn’t be a chore and\nshould be accessible to as many people as possible. Yet, if you want to have a\nfull breakdown of how to use the Particl Open Marketplace, you can either read \nthis tutorial blog post\n[https://particl.news/understanding-and-use-of-the-particl-marketplace-9866cd8190f5] \nor consult this Wiki step-by-step guide [https://particl.wiki/how-to-buy-sell].\n\nWhat Can You Buy & Sell\nParticl’s Open Marketplace is a two-sided marketplace. By definition, a\ntwo-sided marketplace is a marketplace for “exchange between\n[https://reasonstreet.co/business-model-two-sided-marketplace/]two\n[https://reasonstreet.co/business-model-two-sided-marketplace/] distinct user\ngroups that provide each other with the benefits of a large network\n[https://reasonstreet.co/business-model-two-sided-marketplace/]”.\n\nThat means it is entirely up to the users to figure out what they want to buy\nand what they want to sell, and when demand arises, supply should usually follow\nto fill a void. The best example of a two-sided marketplace is eBay — a\nmarketplace where both sellers and buyers are “customers” of and provide each\nother benefits (the seller provides the buyer with items they’re looking for,\nand the buyer provides the sellers with revenue).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Next?\nThis is only the beginning of a long journey for Particl. This mainnet release,\ndubbed a Beta release, marks the first mainnet iteration of many to come for the\nmarketplace.\n\nIt means a lot of intended features are still not implemented yet, and that a\nlot of improvement will be made along the way. This is why your feedback will be\nextremely valuable. What do you think is missing from this marketplace? How was\nyour experience in a particular situation and how could it be improved?\n\nIn the foreseeable future, the Particl team will be focusing on developing some\nof the core features identified earlier in the year. That includes, but isn’t\nlimited to:\n\n * A mobile application and/or mobile integration\n * The possibility to use other coins on Particl Desktop and/or the marketplace\n * A market management tool allowing for the management of multiple user markets\n * A comment section to allow reviews to be logged in\n * Listing price pegging to allow listings to dynamically adjust their prices in\n   PART\n * And more…\n\nBut for now, it is time to play with the world’s most private and decentralized\nmarketplace as much as possible and observe how it will play out. The Particl\nteam will be on the lookout and will be collecting feedback over the course of\nthe next few days/weeks.\n\nThis important period will certainly help shape the future of the project and\nestablish short to mid-term development priorities.\n\nSo install the marketplace, and let’s get down to business!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-is-Now-Live-on-Mainnet/1-89WBhJh6pZ1PBeAKZB2M3A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>It is finally here!

After years of research, development, fine-tuning, refactoring, and\ncommunity-testing, it is finally ready to be unveiled as the world’s most\ndisruptive and empowering marketplace the world has ever seen.\n\nWhat’s Particl and What’s the Open Marketplace?\nParticl is an entirely decentralized platform. There is no third-party or\nintermediary operating it or having any sort of control over its network. It\nuses a mix of P2P and blockchain technologies, meaning that it is exclusively\nrun by its global community of users.\n\nThe Open Marketplace is an equally decentralized application that’s built on top\nof the Particl network. It allows anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and\nservices, physical or digital, regardless of where they are located in the\nworld. And because it is entirely decentralized, there’s no staff or support\nteam to enforce rules and policies.\n\nFurthermore, the Open Marketplace is completely private by default, meaning no\nidentifiable data can be linked to any of its users. Transactions are hidden on\nthe blockchain, images are stripped of their metadata, data exchange is\nencrypted, and you can even connect the marketplace through the Tor network. In\nother words, users of the marketplace are anonymous.\n\nWhat’s important to note, though, is that the Open Marketplace is still very\ndeep into its development phase. In fact, this mainnet release will mark the\nbeginning of the Beta phase of development. Whereas the Alpha phase was mostly\nfocused on building the base layer of the marketplace, Beta will be about adding\nvarious features on top of it and make it more appealing and easy to use for\nvarious types of vendors and buyers.\n\nSo what does it mean? What will you be able to do with Particl’s Open\nMarketplace once it first comes out? What are going to be the available\nfeatures? This blog post will explain, in details, everything you need to know\nprior to the marketplace releasing on mainnet.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSlick, Modern, and User-Friendly Interface\nOne of the most important aspect of any marketplace or product is the user\ninterface and how easy and seamless it is to use. No matter how many great\nfeatures a marketplace has, consumers will opt for a simpler option if it is too\ndifficult use or too time-consuming to learn.\n\nAnd so, with this in mind, the Particl team has put tremendous focus on the Open\nMarketplace’s user experience and interface. In fact, the marketplace is\nintegrated directly into Particl Desktop, the network’s flagship client, and is\ndesigned in a way that makes it easy for everyone to quickly understand how it\nworks. Forget the usual boring and ugly look of cryptocurrency wallets — the\nOpen Marketplace is not only very pleasant to the eye, it is also a very\nintuitive platform that won’t require you to pull all of the hair out of your\nhead just to figure out how to make it work.\n\nYes, this first version mainnet of the marketplace is a Beta build. Yes, there\nare definitely a lot of improvements that are going to be made so that it can be\n“grandma-friendly”, but as Particl always strives to improve its products on all\naspects, and as UI/UX is one of the top focus of the team, it will keep getting\nbetter and more intuitive over time. According to today’s crypto standards,\nParticl Desktop is damn sexy, but the team’s target is set much higher than just\nbeing “good enough” for the crypto crowd.\n\nBuy Stuff for Crypto\n * No fee\n * No identifiable data generated or collected by any 3rd-party\n * No registration or account creation\n * Full escrow support\n * Untraceable currency transactions\n\nIt is already possible to buy many things with cryptocurrencies, but most\noptions are full of friction and they introduce third-parties back in the game.\nThese options either require you to (1) pay a hefty fee, (2) go through many\nsteps and account registrations, or (3) sacrifice your personal data to some\ncompany.\n\nIn most cases, these options introduce all of the above mentioned issues. In all\ncases, the re-introduction of third-parties into the process is proving to be\nhighly counter-productive and more troublesome than simply spending traditional\ncurrencies. Didn’t we start using Bitcoin because we wanted to get rid of\nmiddlemen? Then, why should we have to crawl back to them when we want to spend\nour coins?\n\nParticl fixes all of that in one big swoop by providing a private-by-default\nmarketplace that allows anyone to safely buy products and services online and\npay for them using cryptocurrencies, but without having to deal with any of the\nthree issues introduced by third-parties mentioned just above. After all,\nBitcoin was initially created to be an ecosystem that’s entirely independent\nfrom third-parties, as demonstrated by Satoshi’s early attempt at building a\ndecentralized marketplace on top of the Bitcoin codebase\n[https://news.bitcoin.com/satoshis-pre-release-bitcoin-code-contains-some-fascinating-findings/]\n.\n\nThe Open Marketplace is entirely decentralized and autonomous, meaning it\ndoesn’t rely on any third-party to operate. The absence of any third-party means\nthat you do not have to pay any fee or sacrifice your personal data in order to\nbe able to use cryptocurrencies as actual currencies.\n\nFor the buyer, that means you will likely get access to more affordable products\nsince vendors do not need to pay any fee, except for a small anti-spam listing\nfee. Keep in mind that some online vendors need to pay as high as 40% fee per\nsale, once every fee is paid. Sometimes, that’s even more. That is always\nreflected in the final price that we all pay when shopping online.\n\nSave time and energy by instantly and directly connecting with vendors that\nalready accept cryptocurrencies. Gone are the days you needed to continually\nbrowse the internet to find a vendor that sells the product you are looking\nfor…and accepts cryptocurrencies at the same time.\n\nSell Stuff for Crypto\n * No fee, except for a small listing fee of a few cents\n * No identifiable data generated or collected by any 3rd-party\n * No registration or account creation\n * Full escrow support\n * Untraceable currency transactions\n\nNow, what if you would like to sell some stuff and accept cryptocurrencies? What\nif you wanted to make a business out of it? There are a few options available,\nbut just like for buyers, they require the assistance of third-parties to\nfunction. This introduces a lot of issues for vendors such as (1) paying very\nhigh fees, (2) requiring a lot of paperwork and sign ups, and (3) sacrificing\nyour business data to some company.\n\nThanks to its decentralized structure, the Open Marketplace fixes the issues\nmentioned above by allowing sellers to earn cryptocurrencies by putting products\nand services up for sale on the platform, but without using of any third-party\nor company. The only fee sellers are required to pay, aside from the usual\ncryptocurrency transaction fee, is a small anti-spam listing fee of a few cents\nper day. Everything else is at a big fat 0% fee. For most people selling online,\nthis is about as big of as deal as it gets!\n\nImagine you’re a seller and paying something like 40% fee per transaction, or\neven “just” 15%. Suddenly being charged ~0% on your sales represents a huge\nopportunity and can change your business around in a major way. Not only can you\nmake much more profit per sale, but you can also reduce your prices to gain a\nnet advantage over your competitors.\n\nAnd, since the Open Marketplace is a crypto-focused two-sided marketplace,\nmeaning the platform is populated by both active sellers and buyers, it is the\nideal place to sell items for cryptocurrencies without having to waste hours\nfinding a target audience that is not only looking for your product, but also\nwilling to spend cryptocurrencies for it.\n\nDouble Deposit Escrow System\nParticl Wiki — Double Deposit Escrow System\n[https://particl.wiki/marketplace#decentralized_escrow]\nParticl's Open Marketplace is a decentralized marketplace built with privacy at\nits core. It offers a low-cost, secure…\n[https://particl.wiki/marketplace#decentralized_escrow]particl.wiki\n[https://particl.wiki/marketplace#decentralized_escrow]\n\n * No fee, except for the usual cryptocurrency transaction fee\n * Infinitely scalable\n * No identifiable data generated or collected by any 3rd-party\n * Privacy-focused\n\nUnlike other marketplaces, the Open Marketplace uses a fee-less and\ndecentralized type of escrow (or resolution center). Just like the rest of the\nplatform, this escrow system doesn’t rely on any third-party for issues to be\nresolved.\n\nIn fact, the Open Marketplace’s escrow system is based on the Mutually Assured\nDestruction (MAD) game-theory and requires both sellers and buyers to make a\nsecurity deposit, on top of the regular payment, into a smart-contract. The\nsecurity deposits are refunded, in full, to the participants when both of them\nmark the transaction as complete.\n\nNot requiring any third-party for the escrow system dramatically increases\nprivacy since no escrow agent can have access to your transaction details,\nconversation history, and tracking information. It allows you to own your data\nby ensuring that none of it can be collected by any party other than the one you\nare transacting with.\n\nParticl’s double deposit escrow system is also almost free to use. Unlike most\neCommerce platform, protecting yourself from a party you do not know or trust\nwon’t require you to pay anything other than a simple cryptocurrency transaction\nfee.\n\nAs a comparison, some marketplaces and online commerce platforms will charge you\na considerable fee, sometimes as high as 20% per transaction, just for using an\nescrow or mediation service. These fees tend to be higher on B2B-focused\nmarketplaces.\n\nTake Your Privacy Back\nParticl Explained - Private Transactions\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd]\nAnonymous transactions, or Anon transactions, as referred to in Particl\nDesktop,\ntake privacy to the next level by not…\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd]\n\n * Untraceable currency transactions\n * No metadata when uploading files (i.e. listing pictures)\n * No identifiable data generated\n * No account creation, registration, or KYC required\n * IP addresses can easily be hidden\n\nYou would think that a decentralized marketplace that doesn’t require any\nthird-party, at any step of the process, would be better at keeping your data\nprivate. That, unfortunately, couldn’t be further from the truth.\n\nIn fact, blockchains are publicly auditable ledgers that permanently record your\ndata. And while data written on a blockchain is usually pseudonymous, it is\nentirely possible to collect, analyze, decipher, and use it. Blockchain analysis\nfirms are getting exponentially better at mining and deciphering data stored on\nblockchains. Some of the largest crypto companies are even doing it out in the\nopen\n[https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/a3bn5e/coinbase-neutrino-former-hacking-team-members]\n. In other words, if you’re worried about how your data is being collected and\nused (hint: and you should be), using a public blockchain might not be ideal for\nyou.\n\nThat’s precisely why the Open Marketplace is private by default. That means you\nwon’t need to do any extra step to protect your privacy and your data won’t be\nout there on a public blockchain for everyone to see and decipher, at any point\nin time. Particl’s Open Marketplace does it all for you.\n\nBy integrating the Confidential Transactions (CT) and RingCT privacy protocols\ninto Particl’s double deposit escrow system, all currency transactions are\nhidden on the blockchain and can’t be traced back to users. Additionally, all\ndata uploaded on the marketplace is stripped of all its metadata so that it\ncan’t be reverse engineered (did you know most pictures taken by phones usually\ncontain a geo-tag?).\n\nThe only privacy enhancing feature that is not enabled by default is the Tor\nnetwork integration. While easy and very quick to set up\n[http://particl.wiki/tor-hs], it requires users to manually enable it. That’s\nbecause pushing automatic updates introduces security vulnerabilities,\nespecially man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.\n\nDecentralized Marketplace Moderation\nParticl Explained - Decentralized Marketplace Moderation\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-decentralized-marketplace-moderation-7daa3c75d5b2]\nTo vote against a specific listing, users need to flag it using the Open\nMarketplace user interface. Once the first…\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-decentralized-marketplace-moderation-7daa3c75d5b2]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-decentralized-marketplace-moderation-7daa3c75d5b2]\n\n * 1 coin = 1 vote\n * Delisting threshold is -9,000 coin weight\n * Provably verifiable\n * Cannot be gamed or produce fake votes\n * No staff with special access or power involved\n\nUsually, to keep marketplaces free of undesirable content, companies use an army\nof moderators and dedicated staff to delete listings and ban users. In the case\nof the Open Marketplace, however, that is impossible as there is no third-party\ninvolved.\n\nParticl instead built a completely decentralized governance mechanism, based on\ngame-theory, that allows anyone in the community to flag undesirable content off\nof the marketplace. The system uses a similar model as the very well known\nReddit model — any user can upvote or downvote a listing, and when it reaches a\ncertain negative threshold, that listing gets deleted from the marketplace. But\nunlike Reddit’s system, which is based on a 1 user = 1 vote basis, the Open\nMarketplace uses a 1 coin = 1 vote basis.\n\nThis system ensures that the Open Marketplace stays clean by employing what can\neffectively become the world’s largest community of moderators. It also ensures\nthat only the users of the platform have an actual say on what content gets to\nstay on there, avoiding troll armies and ill-intended individuals.\n\n> Note: On this first mainnet version of the Particl Open Marketplace, a listing\nwill get taken down entirely once it reaches a negative threshold of -9,000.\nCommunity Proposals\nDecentralized Project Governance Update\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6]\nAs we’ve highlighted in our third Community Update, the Particl team has begun\nworking on the initial version of the…\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6]\n\n * 1 coin = 1 vote\n * Anyone can submit proposals to the community\n * Anyone can vote on proposals\n\nUsing the same system that powers the decentralized moderation system, any\nParticl user can create or vote on a proposal using the Particl Desktop client.\nThis introduces a lot of opportunities for buyers, vendors, and cryptocurrency\nusers.\n\nFor example, this system could be used to reach community consensus on important\ndecisions related to the project. The community could vote on initiatives to\nfund using the common Community Fund\n[https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/address.dws?RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM.htm]\n. Vendors could also make use of this feature to poll their customer base about\nwhat type of product they should be focusing. The possibilities are endless and\nit is entirely up to the community to use the system as they please.\n\nAnd just like the decentralized moderation system, each user carries its own\nvoting weight, as determined by the number of coins they hold. This ensures only\nthose with a stake in the project can have a voice, a concept not too different\nfrom the stakeholder concept in publicly traded companies.\n\nMulti-wallets\nMulti-Wallets on Particl Desktop\n[https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076]\nMulti-wallets are not new to Particl. In fact, they have been available on\nParticl-Qt ever since Particl forked to…\n[https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076]particl.news\n[https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076]\n\nReleasing on mainnet at the same time as the Particl Open Marketplace,\nmulti-wallets allow you to manage multiple wallets within the same Particl\nDesktop environment. In this case, multi-wallets can be compared to ‘user\naccounts’ that are completely independent from each other.\n\nMulti-wallets enable a much better degree of security and privacy as each wallet\nis entirely isolated from the others. That means no information or data\n(purchases, profiles, sales data, transaction details, and etc) can leak from a\nwallet to another. It is impossible, simply by looking into the blockchain, that\ntwo wallets are hosted under the same Particl Desktop instance unless the owner\nof the two wallets has linked them together by making payments to an address\nalready identified as belonging to that user.\n\nMulti-wallets can also be used to manage various profiles on the marketplace,\nseller or buyer, and completely keep your identity private between each of the\nwallets. However, market management and market user management tools will come\nat a later time during the Beta phase of development and won’t be part of the\ninitial mainnet version of the marketplace.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith all of that being said, the Particl Open Marketplace will be the first\nprivacy-focused decentralized marketplace of its kind to ever see the day and\nwill mark an important milestone in the history of online eCommerce. It will go\nlive, on mainnet, on the 12th of August 2019 and will include all features\nmentioned in this blog post.\n\nBut don’t get too complacent, this is just the beginning of one very epic\njourney in disrupting one of the biggest sector of the global economy. This\nrelease will also mark the beginning of the Open Marketplace’s Beta phase of\ndevelopment, and it will only get more interesting and exciting from here on\nout. Moving forward, you can expect many more features to be included to it,\nmaking it a real behemoth in both the blockchain and eCommerce worlds. You can\nalso expect more users to start using it, as well as more third-party\nintegrations to see the day. Suffice to say, there’s a lot of good stuff coming\nup for Particl, and each milestone that will be reached from this point onward\nwill be more exciting than the previous one.\n\nBuckle up, because this train is finally getting moving, and there ain’t no\nstopping after it gets released out in the open!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace---What-to-Expect-on-Day-1/1-gAK1frBqYBuhi6WzZZpftg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Particl’s Open Marketplace is finally just a few days away, within an arm’s reach!

In this case, multi-wallets can be compared to ‘user accounts’ that are completely independent from each other.</p><p>Multi-wallets enable a much better degree of security and privacy as each wallet is entirely isolated from the others. That means no information or data (purchases, profiles, sales data, transaction details, and etc) can leak from a wallet to another. It is impossible, simply by looking into the blockchain, that two wallets are hosted under the same Particl Desktop instance unless the owner of the two wallets has linked them together by making payments to an address already identified as belonging to that user.</p><p>Multi-wallets can also be used to manage various profiles on the marketplace, seller or buyer, and completely keep your identity private between each of the wallets. However, market management and market user management tools will come at a later time during the Beta phase of development and won’t be part of the initial mainnet version of the marketplace.</p><hr><p>With all of that being said, the Particl Open Marketplace will be the first privacy-focused decentralized marketplace of its kind to ever see the day and will mark an important milestone in the history of online eCommerce. <strong>It will go live, on mainnet, on the 12th of August 2019 and will include all features mentioned in this blog post.</strong></p><p>But don’t get too complacent, this is just the beginning of one very epic journey in disrupting one of the biggest sector of the global economy. This release will also mark the beginning of the Open Marketplace’s Beta phase of development, and it will only get more interesting and exciting from here on out. Moving forward, you can expect many more features to be included to it, making it a real behemoth in both the blockchain and eCommerce worlds. You can also expect more users to start using it, as well as more third-party integrations to see the day. Suffice to say, there’s a lot of good stuff coming up for Particl, and each milestone that will be reached from this point onward will be more exciting than the previous one.</p><p>Buckle up, because this train is finally getting moving, and there ain’t no stopping after it gets released out in the open!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace---What-to-Expect-on-Day-1/1-cx5kMA6I0j5UIUCKprYfuQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure>","url":"http://localhost:2368/particl-open-marketplace-what-to-expect-on-day-1-c7dd46c46db/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"52b9ba6d-6648-44f4-b2ac-60b858d8d19a","codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5f7e4ca61a93b603e3f767bb","reading_time":11,"send_email_when_published":false,"email_subject":null,"childHtmlRehype":{"html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace---What-to-Expect-on-Day-1/1-gAK1frBqYBuhi6WzZZpftg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Particl’s Open Marketplace is finally just a few days away, within an arm’s reach! After years of research, development, fine-tuning, refactoring, and community-testing, it is finally ready to be unveiled as the world’s most disruptive and empowering marketplace the world has ever seen.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-particl-and-what-s-the-open-marketplace\">What’s Particl and What’s the Open Marketplace?</h2><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_6SvhwFYnOU?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Particl is an entirely decentralized platform. There is no third-party or intermediary operating it or having any sort of control over its network. It uses a mix of P2P and blockchain technologies, meaning that it is exclusively run by its global community of users.</p><p>The Open Marketplace is an equally decentralized application that’s built on top of the Particl network. It allows anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and services, physical or digital, regardless of where they are located in the world. And because it is entirely decentralized, there’s no staff or support team to enforce rules and policies.</p><p>Furthermore, the Open Marketplace is completely private by default, meaning no identifiable data can be linked to any of its users. Transactions are hidden on the blockchain, images are stripped of their metadata, data exchange is encrypted, and you can even connect the marketplace through the Tor network. In other words, users of the marketplace are anonymous.</p><p>What’s important to note, though, is that the Open Marketplace is still very deep into its development phase. In fact, this mainnet release will mark the beginning of the Beta phase of development. Whereas the Alpha phase was mostly focused on <strong>building the base layer of the marketplace</strong>, Beta will be about <strong>adding various features</strong> on top of it and make it more appealing and easy to use for various types of vendors and buyers.</p><p>So what does it mean? What will you be able to do with Particl’s Open Marketplace once it first comes out? What are going to be the available features? This blog post will explain, in details, everything you need to know prior to the marketplace releasing on mainnet.</p><hr><h2 id=\"slick-modern-and-user-friendly-interface\">Slick, Modern, and User-Friendly Interface</h2><p>One of the most important aspect of any marketplace or product is the user interface and how easy and seamless it is to use. No matter how many great features a marketplace has, consumers will opt for a simpler option if it is too difficult use or too time-consuming to learn.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace---What-to-Expect-on-Day-1/1-DhXEPhuXIsBc3EKOf938hg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>And so, with this in mind, the Particl team has put tremendous focus on the Open Marketplace’s user experience and interface. In fact, the marketplace is integrated directly into Particl Desktop, the network’s flagship client, and is designed in a way that makes it easy for everyone to quickly understand how it works. Forget the usual boring and ugly look of cryptocurrency wallets — the Open Marketplace is not only very pleasant to the eye, it is also a very intuitive platform that won’t require you to pull all of the hair out of your head just to figure out how to make it work.</p><p>Yes, this first version mainnet of the marketplace is a Beta build. Yes, there are definitely a lot of improvements that are going to be made so that it can be “grandma-friendly”, but as Particl always strives to improve its products on all aspects, and as UI/UX is one of the top focus of the team, it will keep getting better and more intuitive over time. According to today’s crypto standards, Particl Desktop is damn sexy, but the team’s target is set much higher than just being “good enough” for the crypto crowd.</p><h2 id=\"buy-stuff-for-crypto\">Buy Stuff for Crypto</h2><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qKOA4dOAFeM?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><ul><li><strong>No fee</strong></li><li><strong>No identifiable data generated or collected by any 3rd-party</strong></li><li><strong>No registration or account creation</strong></li><li><strong>Full escrow support</strong></li><li><strong>Untraceable currency transactions</strong></li></ul><p>It is already possible to buy many things with cryptocurrencies, but most options are full of friction and they introduce third-parties back in the game. These options either require you to (1) pay a hefty fee, (2) go through many steps and account registrations, or (3) sacrifice your personal data to some company.</p><p>In most cases, these options introduce all of the above mentioned issues. In all cases, the re-introduction of third-parties into the process is proving to be highly counter-productive and more troublesome than simply spending traditional currencies. Didn’t we start using Bitcoin because we wanted to get rid of middlemen? Then, why should we have to crawl back to them when we want to spend our coins?</p><p>Particl fixes all of that in one big swoop by providing a private-by-default marketplace that allows anyone to safely buy products and services online and pay for them using cryptocurrencies, but without having to deal with any of the three issues introduced by third-parties mentioned just above. After all, Bitcoin was initially created to be an ecosystem that’s entirely independent from third-parties, as demonstrated by <a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/satoshis-pre-release-bitcoin-code-contains-some-fascinating-findings/\"><strong>Satoshi’s early attempt at building a decentralized marketplace on top of the Bitcoin codebase</strong></a>.</p><p>The Open Marketplace is entirely decentralized and autonomous, meaning it doesn’t rely on any third-party to operate. The absence of any third-party means that you do not have to pay any fee or sacrifice your personal data in order to be able to use cryptocurrencies as actual currencies.</p><p>For the buyer, that means <strong>you will likely get access to more affordable products since vendors do not need to pay any fee</strong>, except for a small anti-spam listing fee. Keep in mind that some online vendors need to pay as high as 40% fee per sale, once every fee is paid. Sometimes, that’s even more. That is always reflected in the final price that we all pay when shopping online.</p><p>Save time and energy by <strong>instantly</strong> and <strong>directly</strong> connecting with vendors that already accept cryptocurrencies. Gone are the days you needed to continually browse the internet to find a vendor that sells the product you are looking for…and accepts cryptocurrencies at the same time.</p><h2 id=\"sell-stuff-for-crypto\">Sell Stuff for Crypto</h2><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/86ejmW0BkGI?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><ul><li><strong>No fee, except for a small listing fee of a few cents</strong></li><li><strong>No identifiable data generated or collected by any 3rd-party</strong></li><li><strong>No registration or account creation</strong></li><li><strong>Full escrow support</strong></li><li><strong>Untraceable currency transactions</strong></li></ul><p>Now, what if you would like to sell some stuff and accept cryptocurrencies? What if you wanted to make a business out of it? There are a few options available, but just like for buyers, they require the assistance of third-parties to function. This introduces a lot of issues for vendors such as (1) paying very high fees, (2) requiring a lot of paperwork and sign ups, and (3) sacrificing your business data to some company.</p><p>Thanks to its decentralized structure, the Open Marketplace fixes the issues mentioned above by allowing sellers to earn cryptocurrencies by putting products and services up for sale on the platform, but without using of any third-party or company. The only fee sellers are required to pay, aside from the usual cryptocurrency transaction fee, is a small anti-spam listing fee of a few cents per day. Everything else is at a big fat 0% fee. For most people selling online, this is about as big of as deal as it gets!</p><p>Imagine you’re a seller and paying something like 40% fee per transaction, or even “just” 15%.

In this case, multi-wallets can be compared to ‘user accounts’ that are completely independent from each other.</p><p>Multi-wallets enable a much better degree of security and privacy as each wallet is entirely isolated from the others. That means no information or data (purchases, profiles, sales data, transaction details, and etc) can leak from a wallet to another. It is impossible, simply by looking into the blockchain, that two wallets are hosted under the same Particl Desktop instance unless the owner of the two wallets has linked them together by making payments to an address already identified as belonging to that user.</p><p>Multi-wallets can also be used to manage various profiles on the marketplace, seller or buyer, and completely keep your identity private between each of the wallets. However, market management and market user management tools will come at a later time during the Beta phase of development and won’t be part of the initial mainnet version of the marketplace.</p><hr><p>With all of that being said, the Particl Open Marketplace will be the first privacy-focused decentralized marketplace of its kind to ever see the day and will mark an important milestone in the history of online eCommerce. <strong>It will go live, on mainnet, on the 12th of August 2019 and will include all features mentioned in this blog post.</strong></p><p>But don’t get too complacent, this is just the beginning of one very epic journey in disrupting one of the biggest sector of the global economy. This release will also mark the beginning of the Open Marketplace’s Beta phase of development, and it will only get more interesting and exciting from here on out. Moving forward, you can expect many more features to be included to it, making it a real behemoth in both the blockchain and eCommerce worlds. You can also expect more users to start using it, as well as more third-party integrations to see the day. Suffice to say, there’s a lot of good stuff coming up for Particl, and each milestone that will be reached from this point onward will be more exciting than the previous one.</p><p>Buckle up, because this train is finally getting moving, and there ain’t no stopping after it gets released out in the open!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace---What-to-Expect-on-Day-1/1-cx5kMA6I0j5UIUCKprYfuQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":["kg-card","kg-image-card"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace---What-to-Expect-on-Day-1/1-gAK1frBqYBuhi6WzZZpftg.jpeg","className":["kg-image"],"alt":""},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Particl’s Open Marketplace is finally just a few days away, within an arm’s reach!

There is no third-party or\nintermediary operating it and having any sort of control over its network. It\nuses a mix of P2P and blockchain technologies, meaning that it is exclusively\nrun by its global community of users.\n\nThe Open Marketplace is an equally decentralized application that’s built on top\nof the Particl network. It allows anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and\nservices, physical or digital, regardless of where they are located in the\nworld. And because it is entirely decentralized, there’s no staff or support\nteam to enforce rules and policies.\n\nFurthermore, the Open Marketplace is completely private by default, meaning no\nidentifiable data can be linked to any of its users. Transactions are hidden on\nthe blockchain, images are stripped of their metadata, data exchange is\nencrypted, and you can even connect the marketplace through the Tor network. In\nother words, users of the marketplace are anonymous.\n\nUndesirable Content\nThis, however, introduces a bit of an issue when it comes to the content being\nput on there. After all, how can you prevent anyone from buying or selling\nanything when there are no rules and no central party with special permissions\nto moderate it? Giving special permissions/powers and allowing certain users to\ndelete content and hold such a strong position of power is a slippery slope and,\non a long enough timeline, ultimately a slow crawl back to the old ways where a\ncompany would run its own platform, impose its rules, and charge fees.\n\nBut this isn’t what Particl is about. No, Particl is about full decentralization\nand complete privacy. The recent years, with all of the data breaches like\nEquifax’s and the abuse of data like with the constant scandals involving\nFacebook, have shown without a doubt that the tech industry needs to evolve and\nstart protecting its users.\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f] \nAnd, because data has become so valuable and such a big target for hackers, we\ncannot expect or trust centralized models such as Amazon, Alibaba, eBay, and\ncentral parties, to effectively secure our data.\n\nThis is why Particl’s Open Marketplace is entirely decentralized and\nprivate-by-default. Its “trustless” nature, meaning that you do not need to\ntrust any entity to behave honestly, ensures that none of your data can be\ncollected by any party other than the ones you transact with. It is, simply put,\nthe next logical step in the evolution of eCommerce technology. But like any new\ngroundbreaking technology, it also introduces new challenges. Keeping the\nmarketplace free from undesirable listings is one of them.\n\nDecentralized Governance\nTo fight off undesirable content, Particl has put in place a completely\ndecentralized and provably fair governance mechanism where anyone can vote off\nundesirable listings.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQuick Facts:\n * Voting power ratio: 1 PART coin = 1 vote\n * Delisting threshold at time of publishing: -9,000 PART (adjustable)\n * Need to be staking?: No\n * Fee for flagging an item: Less than 0.001 PART for the first person to flag,\n   free for additional flaggers\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDelisting Threshold\nTo vote against a specific listing, users need to flag it using the Open\nMarketplace user interface. Once the first user marks a listing as undesirable,\nit gets taken into a queue of previously flagged listings where other users will\nbe able to either agree that it should be taken off the marketplace, or disagree\nand vote for it to remain listed. For a listing to be completely delisted, its\nscore needs to reach a certain negative threshold.\n\nParticl’s decentralized moderation system can be compared to the Reddit\nupvote/downvote system. On Reddit, if 5 users downvote a post, and 3 users\nupvote it, the post has a score of -2. Usually, when it reaches a certain\nnegative threshold (i.e. -10), the post is automatically hidden from other\nusers. Reddit counts votes on a 1 user = 1 vote basis.\n\nParticl’s listing moderation system is similar. Each user that flags and votes\nfor a listing contributes to either increasing or decreasing the listing’s\nscore. It also deletes the listing from the user’s personal instance of the\nclient (deleted locally, but not hidden globally until the listing reaches the\ndelisting threshold). But because Particl is private by design and entirely\ndecentralized, there is no real way for the platform to detect a user that\ncreated multiple addresses or used virtual machines to game the system and\nregister fraudulent votes. The network cannot ban an account, blacklist an IP\naddress, or manually adjust votes to try to fight off spam votes.\n\nInstead, Particl counts votes on a 1 coin = 1 vote, which makes it impossible to\ngame the system. If you want to add more power to your votes, you can do it in a\nlegitimate way: acquire more PART coins. No matter how many wallets you use, or\nno matter how many times you try changing your IP address, the system only takes\nthe “coin weight” into consideration when counting votes. This ensures only\nthose with a stake in the network can influence governance outcomes.\n\nThe delisting threshold of the Particl Open Marketplace will be -9,000 during\nthe first mainnet version. That threshold can and will be adjusted on the way\nforward. It may take a few tweaks until the perfect ratio is reached, but\nbecause game-theory is impossible to test on testnet (because test coins don’t\nhold any value), it has to be tested out in the wild.\n\nGame-Theory\nAs you probably now realize, this mechanism is actually pretty simple, but it’s\nalso quite strong and effective. The reason behind this is the whole game-theory \naspect of it.\n\nTo have significant voting power and single-handedly influence votes, a user\nneeds to acquire a lot of coins. This can be quite expensive depending on the\nactive delisting threshold ratio (in the first mainnet version of the\nmarketplace, that threshold will be -9,000), and it only gets more expensive as\nthe platform starts getting more network effect.\n\nAnd because voters have a direct financial stake in the network, they are\ndirectly incentivized to behave correctly. If voters colluded with each other\nand started trolling or censoring the marketplace, that would arguably reduce\nthe value of the network and incur a net loss for all co-conspirators.\n\nAdditionally, if users do not pro-actively keep the public interface of the\nmarketplace clean, it might result in a platform filled with undesirable or\nspammy content, which would contribute to driving people away. That, too, would\nseverely reduce the potential network effect and would be a serious obstacle to\nParticl reaching a more mainstream audience.\n\nSince voters are users with a financial stake in the network, driving users away\nfrom the platform is not something being desired. That is especially true of a\nmarketplace — more users mean more products to buy (for buyers) and more\npotential customers to reach (for vendors). That is why keeping the interface\nclean is a small, but not insignificant, contribution each user can make to the\nnetwork.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFAQ\n * What’s the delisting threshold?\n * The delisting threshold is currently at -9,000 for the first mainnet version\n   of the Open Marketplace. This threshold can and will be adjusted moving\n   forward.\n\n—\n\n * Will listings disappear after I vote them off?\n * When you flag a listing, it is deleted locally, meaning that it is taken off\n   your own personal instance of the marketplace, but not for other users. A\n   listing is only delisted from everyone’s marketplace instance once it reaches\n   the delisting threshold.\n\n—\n\n * Do I need to be staking to vote?\n * No, coins do not need to be staking. Anyone with a coin can vote.\n\n—\n\n * Can I vote if my coins are stored on a hardware device?\n * Not initially, but hardware device support is something being considered for\n   later in the future.\n\n—\n\n * Is there a fee for flagging listings?\n * If you are the first user to flag a listing that has never been flagged\n   before, you will need to be a sub-cent fee (0.00x PART or less). If you are\n   flagging a listing that’s already been flagged before, then there is no fee\n   to be paid.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

For a listing to be completely delisted, its score needs to reach a certain negative threshold.</p><p>Particl’s decentralized moderation system can be compared to the Reddit upvote/downvote system. On Reddit, if 5 users downvote a post, and 3 users upvote it, the post has a score of -2. Usually, when it reaches a certain negative threshold (i.e. -10), the post is automatically hidden from other users. <strong>Reddit counts votes on a 1 user = 1 vote basis.</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained---Decentralized-Marketplace-Moderation/1-4oviqSSL0DeUDYK6vFHdhg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Particl’s listing moderation system is similar. Each user that flags and votes for a listing contributes to either increasing or decreasing the listing’s score. It also deletes the listing from the user’s personal instance of the client (deleted locally, but not hidden globally until the listing reaches the delisting threshold). But because Particl is private by design and entirely decentralized, there is no real way for the platform to detect a user that created multiple addresses or used virtual machines to game the system and register fraudulent votes. The network cannot ban an account, blacklist an IP address, or manually adjust votes to try to fight off spam votes.</p><p>Instead, <strong>Particl counts votes on a 1 coin = 1 vote</strong>, which makes it impossible to game the system. If you want to add more power to your votes, you can do it in a legitimate way: acquire more PART coins. No matter how many wallets you use, or no matter how many times you try changing your IP address, the system only takes the “coin weight” into consideration when counting votes. This ensures only those with a stake in the network can influence governance outcomes.</p><p><strong>The delisting threshold of the Particl Open Marketplace will be -9,000 during the first mainnet version.</strong> That threshold can and will be adjusted on the way forward.

The reason behind this is the whole <strong>game-theory</strong> aspect of it.</p><p>To have significant voting power and single-handedly influence votes, a user needs to acquire a lot of coins. This can be quite expensive depending on the active delisting threshold ratio (in the first mainnet version of the marketplace, that threshold will be <strong>-9,000</strong>), and it only gets more expensive as the platform starts getting more network effect.</p><p>And because voters have a direct financial stake in the network, they are directly incentivized to behave correctly.

This means the submission period is over, and the\nvoting process now begins.\n\nMarket Key Submissions [https://github.com/particl/particl-market/pulls]\nYou can't perform that action at this time.

Now’s the time to let people know\nwhat set of Market Keys you want to see used as the default keys for the main\ninterface of the Particl Open Marketplace. In order to make the voting process\nas accessible as possible, we’re taking the process over two different\nplatforms: Particl’s Twitter page and the Particl community forum.\n\nThe first thing you’ll need to do before voting is opening Github to the pull\nrequest page of particl-market. This is where you’ll see all of the Market Key\nsubmissions. Then, simply have a look at the keys and note down the number of\nthe pull request attached to the set of Market Keys you want to submit. Once\nthat’s done, either head over to Twitter or the Particl community forum and cast\nyour vote! The voting period will end on the 8th of August at 4:00:00 (UTC).\n\n> Note: You can only pick Market Keys that have been submitted before the end of\nthe contest. That means you can only vote for pull request #406 to #458.\nTwitter\nVoting on Twitter isn’t really complicated. Simply click the link below to be\nredirected to the tweet used for the voting process, and write in the comment\nsection the number of the pull request attached to the set of Market Keys you’d\nlike to see win this contest. Make sure that the number of the pull request is\nclearly identified.\n\n> \nParticl Community Forum\nTo vote on the forum, simply click on the link below to be redirected to the\nthread used for the voting process and register your vote by writing the number\nof the pull request associated with the set of keys you want to win in the\ncomment section of the thread. If you do not have an account yet, the process of\ncreating one is fairly straight-forward.\n\nMarket Key Voting Thread\n[https://particl.community/t/market-key-voting-thread/591]\nOn the 17th of July, it was announced that the community could start creating\nand submitting sets of Market Keys on…\n[https://particl.community/t/market-key-voting-thread/591]particl.community\n[https://particl.community/t/market-key-voting-thread/591]\n\n> Note: You can vote on both Twitter and the Particl community forum. In that\ncase, you will be casting two votes and both will be registered.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPrizes and How to Claim Them\nAside from being a big part of Particl’s history, there is no prize associated\nwith winning this contest. That’s because the Particl team wants people to vote\nwith their heart and to reduce the number of fraudulent votes.\n\nHowever, everyone that has submitted a set of Market Keys gets a free limited\nedition Particl t-shirt as well as the chance to win one of the three (3) free\nTrezor hardware wallets being given away.\n\nTrezor Winners\nThe three lucky community members who will walk out of this contest with one of\nthe three (3) free Trezor hardware wallets being given away will be announced on\nthe 8th of August, briefly after the voting period for the Market Keys end.\nWinners will be picked at random and will be announced on Twitter as well as on\nParticl’s chat platforms (Discord, Telegram, and Riot). Additionally, the\nwinners will be notified about it right from their pull request on Github as a\ncomment coming from Cryptoguard. Good luck everyone!\n\nClaim Your Prize\nTo claim your prize, head over to Particl’s community forum by following the\nlink below and register using the Github application. Then, go to Cryptoguard’s\nprofile (https://particl.community/u/Cryptoguard/summary) and send him a message\nwith the physical address you want to receive your prize(s).\n\nClaiming your prize(s) and giving away your physical address is entirely\noptional. All addresses will be deleted from our systems a few weeks after the\nprizes are all shipped (so that we can assist you in case of shipping issues).\n\n> Note: You must submit your physical address with an account logged in through\nthe Github login app of the Particl forum. This ensures that you are the right\nperson submitting the address and not an impersonator.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Market-Key-Generation-Contest-Voting-Period/1-QOoDlouL2J6BFxbBkS-YDw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"it-s-time-to-vote\">It’s Time to Vote</h3><p>On the <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-second-anniversary-91e878efa3c0\">17th of July</a>, it was announced that the community could start creating and submitting sets of Market Keys on Github so that they could be used as the default keys for the main interface of the wallet.

This build allows you to test the\nnewly introduced “anon” escrow. This escrow system makes all marketplace\ntransactions private-by-default thanks to a combination of the CT and RingCT\nprivacy protocols. This testnet build also contains a vast range of tweaks that\nhave been made to the user interface since the last testnet round.\n\nTo ensure that the code is as stable as it can be and free of any bugs, the\nParticl team is inviting you to participate in a bug bounty where you will be\nrewarded, in PART, if you find any bug within Particl Desktop and the Open\nMarketplace.\n\nSo let’s dive deeper into this bug hunting bounty!\n\n> Note: If any bug is found during this testing round, it will likely be fixed on\nthe spot in internal builds. New builds, batched with multiple bug fixes at\nonce, would then be posted throughout the duration of the bounty, meaning there\ncould potentially be more than one build published during the duration of this\nbug bounty. Reported bugs can only earn you a bounty payment if they’re being\nreported on the latest build publicly available.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCatching Bugs\nThe instructions to participate in this bug bounty are pretty simple:\n\nLatest build version + location of the Report Bug button * Download the latest testnet build of the Open Marketplace. While there is a\n   working testnet version available here\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/], newer builds with\n   fixed bugs may be posted in the #testing channel on either Discord\n   [http://discord.me/particl], Telegram\n   [https://t.me/joinchat/Gpl8aEYMR8go1QYbM-S2qw], or Riot\n   [https://riot.im/app/#/room/#particl-testing:matrix.org]. Always verify that\n   you are running the latest build by checking the #testing channel first.\n * Make a backup of your\n   configuration files, especially wallet.dat.\n * Run it on a clean\n   install (delete all your testnet configuration folders, including\n   Particl/testnet, Particl Desktop/testnet, and Particl Market). Please make\n   sure to backup any mainnet wallet.dat file you have before you do.\n * Report any bug or\n   issue by clicking on the bug icon on Particl Desktop. This will take you to\n   Particl Desktop’s Issue page on Github. Users need to follow the proper\n   template that automatically fills the text field when you create a new Issue.\n\nWhat’s Considered a Bug\nA bug is an unexpected behavior that breaks functionality. It needs to prevent\nusers from using a feature to its full extent. It can also be a miscalculation,\na behavior that causes wrong amounts to be transferred, or information that’s\ndisplayed incorrectly.\n\nBugs are separated into 3 categories: minor, medium, and critical.\n\nMinor bug ($25): A minor bug is any small unexpected outcome that doesn’t break\nthe build in any significant way, but still considerably impacts the user\nexperience in a negative way. A minor bug can be annoying, but won’t prevent you\nfrom accomplishing any action within the marketplace.\n\nA good example of a minor bug could be this one here: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues/1619\n\nMedium bug ($50): A significant bug breaks the build or prevents you from\naccomplishing a certain action. They are more than just annoyances, they prevent\nyou from doing an action.\n\nAn example of what a medium bug could look like would be not being able to add\nan item to your cart, prices of items not showing up on any listing or a button\nthat wouldn’t do anything upon clicking on it.\n\nMajor bug ($100): A critical bug is a major issue that not only breaks the build\nand prevents you from accomplishing a task, but that also could result in a loss\nof funds or an incorrectly transferred amount.\n\nAn example of what a major bug could look like would be if the escrow system\nbreaks up and becomes unusable or sends the wrong amounts to the wrong users.\n\nNOTE: The Particl team has sole discretion over what level a bug is categorized\ninto. While the criteria are clear about what makes a bug a minor, medium, or\ncritical one, some bugs may not be as clear cut. In that scenario, Particl\ndevelopers will determine its level.\n\nWhat’s NOT Considered a Bug\nAlthough you may encounter issues, not all of them are considered as bugs. These\nissues may include:\n\n * A typo\n * An improvement suggestion\n * A button is not perfectly aligned\n * A small visual glitch\n * A styling issue\n * A perceived need to change/add buttons\n\nHow to Report an Issue on Github\nFor a bug to qualify for a bounty payment, it has to be properly reported on the\nParticl Desktop’s Issue page on Github and use the proper template that’s\nautomatically generated when clicking on New Issue. This helps developers\nunderstand the issue more quickly and reproduce it on their end so that it can\nbe fixed more rapidly.\n\nTo access Particl Desktop’s Issue page, simply click on the Bug icon located at\nthe bottom left corner of the Particl Desktop wallet. This will automatically\ntake you to the Github page where bugs and issues get reported. Once you are\nthere, simply click the green New Issue button. Alternatively, you can manually\nvisit this Github page by following this link: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues/new\n\n> Note: You will need a Github account to log issues and bugs.\nThe Fine Prints\n * All bug bounties are paid in PART\n * The bug hunting bounty will run for 7 days (from the 1st of August to the 8th\n   of August, 16:00:00 UTC)\n * Only bugs reported on Github using the proper reporting template can qualify\n   for bounty payment.\n * If the same bug is reported more than once, the bounty will be awarded to the\n   first user that reported the issue.\n * The Particl team has sole discretion on what level (minor, medium, or\n   critical) a bug is, and whether an issue is actually a bug or not.\n * Reported bugs need to be from the latest build available. Bugs on older\n   versions aren’t eligible for bounty payment. The latest version can be\n   downloaded from the #testing channel on either Discord\n   [http://discord.me/particl], Telegram\n   [https://t.me/joinchat/Gpl8aEYMR8go1QYbM-S2qw], or Riot\n   [https://riot.im/app/#/room/#particl-testing:matrix.org].\n * There is an assessment period for each bug submission. Each reported bug\n   needs to be approved for bounty payment by the Particl team.\n * Payments will be done at the end of the bug bounty\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith that being said, good luck in your hunt for bugs, and see you on mainnet!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace-Testnet-Bug-Bounty/1-yt8oCJgUcMXk71DqSkOTog.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"earn-part-for-catching-bugs\">Earn PART for Catching Bugs</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace-Testnet-Bug-Bounty/1-S_fPVIak-t6K7ukw7LoCDA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Particl just started, on the 1st of August, the final testing round of the Open Marketplace before it moves up onto mainnet.

Disclaimer, the next few days are going to be\nPACKED!\n\nAugust 1st, 2019\nOn this day, Particl is initiating the last round of testing, on testnet, before\nthe Particl Open Marketplace goes live on mainnet. This build contains all of\nthe bug fixes from the last testing round as well as the integration of the\nfully anon escrow system, powered by a combination of RingCT, CT, and\nsmart-contracts.\n\nA testnet bug bounty of a duration of 7 days also accompanies the testnet\nrelease of the Open Marketplace. This bug bounty rewards testers in PART for\ntrying to break the Open Marketplace, one last time, before it goes onto mainnet\nand gets used with real funds. It ensures the mainnet product will be as stable\nand secure as it can be, and that as little inconvenience and problems arise\nwhen new users start using the marketplace.

This permanent bounty is aimed at rewarding users who find bugs,\nexploits, or vulnerabilities in the Particl code to securely disclose issues and\nget promptly rewarded for their hard work. This bounty, just like the testnet\nbounty for the Open Marketplace, ensures that Particl’s code is as secure and\nstable as possible when faced to various attack vectors.

This session will use the same concept as the session the day before, but this\ntime will be done in french. This session will also have a 200 PART airdrop\nwhich will be distributed equally among all participants who complete the\nfollowing steps:\nParticipate in the Hangout session\n\n * Participate in the Hangout session\n * Share your screen while testing the Open Marketplace\n * Create a listing and go through the process of selling an item OR purchase an\n   item and go through the entire buy flow\n * Write either your Telegram or Discord username on the Hangout chat so that an\n   admin can contact you later on to get your PART deposit address\n\nTo participate in this Hangout session, follow this link: \nhttps://hangouts.google.com/group/9K81RY78dDSpgukL9\n\nNote: Once over, the session will be published on Particl’s Youtube page.\n\nAugust 5th, 2019\nOn the 5th of August, the Market Key Generation Contest will be over and any\nsubmitted Market Key passed this date will not be accepted as part of the\ncontest. This date will also mark the beginning of the 2-day voting process\nwhere the Particl community will get the pick the one set of Market Keys that\nwill generate the main interface of the Particl Open Marketplace. For more\ndetails about what are Market Keys and how you can participate in the contest,\nfollow the link below.\n\nMarket Key Generation Contest\n[https://particl.news/market-key-generation-contest-e7b93ec14f60]\nWin a Trezor Hardware Device and a Limited Edition T-Shirt ?\n[https://particl.news/market-key-generation-contest-e7b93ec14f60]particl.news\n[https://particl.news/market-key-generation-contest-e7b93ec14f60]\n\nAfter all, everyone that participates will win a free limited edition Particl\nt-shirt as well as get the chance to win one of the three (3) free Trezor\nhardware wallets being given away to participants. Why not give it a go?\n\nAugust 7th, 2019\nTwo days after the end of the Market Key submission period, at 18:00:00 UTC, the\nvoting period in which the community will pick the set of Market Keys it wants\nto use as the default Market Keys of the main interface of the Open Marketplace\nwill end. This will effectively decide what keys are going to be used once the\nfirst mainnet build of the Particl Open Marketplace will get compiled, and will\ngive Particl Desktop 2.0 its marketplace functionality.\n\nAugust 8th, 2019\nThe Particl Open Marketplace testnet bug bounty will end. The Particl developers\nwill then continue working to fix the identified bugs, if any, for the next few\nhours/days. On the same day, the set of Market Keys selected by the community\nwill be integrated into the codebase of the Particl Open Marketplace.\n\nAugust 9th, 2019 - August 12th, 2019\nDuring this period of 4 days, the Particl development team will fix any\nidentified bugs and compile internal builds running on both testnet and mainnet\nto conduct the last round of internal testing. These builds will contain all the\npotential bug fixes resulting from the bug bounty, and will also run using the\ncommunity-generated set of Market Keys.\n\nAugust 12th, 2019 — The BIG Day\nThe 12th of August will be Particl’s biggest day to date. This is when the\nParticl Open Marketplace releases on mainnet, at 12:00:00 UTC. This is the\nmoment everybody’s been waiting for, and it’s just around the corner. Indeed, on\nthis day, Particl Desktop 2.0 will be pushed, with marketplace functionality,\nonto mainnet as a public release.\n\nThis will allow anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and services using\ncryptocurrencies in a way that preserves your digital privacy and personal data.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Particl Team Gets Shuffled\nBut wait, there’s more! Because the project is now in the middle of a phase\nswitch, the Particl team is getting reshuffled to focus more on Particl adoption\nand community building. This means a few members of the team are getting new\nroles and opportunities.\n\nParticl Gets a New Community Manager\nAugust 1st also marks the day where Particl gets a new Community Manager!\nIndeed, Guillaume Benayoun, most commonly known as Ben within the Particl\ncommunity, will join the team’s ranks as Particl’s Community Manager and\nAmbassador.\n\nBen has been a very active member ever since the very beginning of Particl and\nhas almost single-handedly built the Particl FR community. Ben is also behind \nParticl’s evening of presentations at CoinHouse\n[https://particl.news/particl-in-paris-presentations-at-coinhouse-a38106cdd36a],\nParis, which took place on the 21st of February 2019. Click the links below to\nwatch the three presentations made on this evening.\n\n * Cold Staking & Cold Staking Pools, by Guillaume Benayoun\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crzskSfKTWk]\n * The Evolution of Global eCommerce, by Lina Seiche\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQrDPzUGYaY]\n * The Role of Intermediaries in Blockchain eCommerce, by Albin Cauderlier\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfUTKTSL2-I]\n\nAs part of his new role within the Particl team, Ben will work on growing the\nmain Particl community and make it more engaging. He will ensure there is always\na team member available to answer questions, moderate the community, and keep\nthe channels clean. Additionally, he will also help on user onboarding and the\ncreation of sub-communities to drive up the adoption of the Particl Open\nMarketplace. As with any other member of the Particl communications team, he\nwill also help in a lot of other areas touching communications.\n\nCryptoguard Gets a New Role\nCryptoguard, Particl’s former Community Manager, will now assume a more strategy\nand communications-focused role within the Particl team. He will take on some of\nPaul Schmitzer’s role in managing communications and crafting the strategies\nsurrounding it. He will still be around the community and work full-time on the\nproject, but this new position will probably mean he will have a more “in the\nbackground” role. Cryptoguard has started working on these new responsibilities\na while ago, hence why getting a new Community Manager that would be entirely\nfocused on the community was necessary.\n\nPaul Schmitzer Gets a New Role\nAs part of this reshuffling on the communications team, Paul Schmitzer will take\non a more strategic and partnership-focused role, assisting Imran in doing some\nof that. Paul’s new position will be mostly focused on contacting people, help\nto form new partnerships and relationships, and managing the communications\nstrategy on a higher level.\n\nLina Seiche Leaves the Project\nLina Seiche, former Lead Event Coordinator & Community Evangelist for Particl,\nis unfortunately leaving the project in favor of a new job offer she’s received.\nWe would like to thank Lina for her work with Particl and wish her all the best\nwith her future endeavors!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt is with great excitement that we step within this final pre-mainnet phase.\nWith a few years behind our backs, it is now time to let the world know about\nthe wonders of Particl and its Open Marketplace.\n\nSo get prepared, get your computers ready for testing, and let’s revolutionize\nthe world of eCommerce together!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Project-Update/1-kxHpRkWtmo3WsOgNQlqWUg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"toward-the-mainnet-release-of-the-particl-open-marketplace\">Toward the Mainnet Release of the Particl Open Marketplace</h3><p>The gears are turning, and ever since the Market Key Generation Contest was announced on the 26th of July, the process of bringing the Particl Open Marketplace on mainnet is now well in motion!</p><p>This blog post is going to be an important one — it will give you all the information you need to know about what’s coming up as well as the remaining steps before the Open Marketplace moves onto mainnet.</p><hr><h2 id=\"the-road-to-mainnet\">The Road to Mainnet</h2><p>It is finally here! <strong>The Particl Open Marketplace goes live on mainnet on the 12th of August!</strong></p><p>Ever since the 16th of July, we have entered in the final mile of the marathon that is the mainnet launch of the Particl Open Marketplace.

This time, it is also\naccompanied by a testnet bug bounty that will reward you for finding bugs\nrelated to the Particl Open Marketplace.\n\nEver since the last testnet build of the Open Marketplace on the 10th of July,\nthe Particl team has not only been very busy integrating RingCT into the escrow\nsystem of the marketplace but also fixing a market start-up and switching issue\nidentified earlier last week. It is with great excitement that it can be\nannounced today that the testnet build is now ready for public testing and will \nmove up onto mainnet on the 12th of August, 2019!\n\nGet Started!\nDownload and get started with testing the Open Marketplace by following this\nGithub link:\n\nparticl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha2-testnet]\nYou can't perform that action at this time.

For those of you that have tested the marketplace on testnet before, please\n    do remember that you will need to wipe your existing marketplace database,\n    otherwise, you may encounter errors that will break your experience. The\n    location of your particl-market is dependent on the OS you use.\n\n * Windows:C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Roaming\\particl-market\n * macOS:~/Library/Application Support/particl-market\n * Linux:~/.particl-market\n\n2. To use the marketplace, you need to create a marketplace-enabled wallet. To\ndo that, you need to first create a normal wallet as usual. Then, once that is\ndone, create a second wallet and name in Market. Once generated, that wallet\nwill have the marketplace enabled.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s New Since Last Time?\nNew Features\n * Fully anonymous escrow support, powered by RingCT\n * Added the ability to support free shipping\n * Added text to the help sections on the buy and sell page to indicate to users\n   that their wallets need to be unlocked to process buy flow messages\n * Error message dialog for when proposal creation fails\n\nChanges to Existing Features\n * On the top bar of the listings, buy and sell pages, the available Anon\n   balance of your wallet is displayed\n * “Spendable” and “Locked” on the Overview page is now a summary of all\n   balances\n * Instead of the balance transfer label on the Overview page, the transaction\n   type is now displayed (i.e. Converted to blind)\n * Added the ability to copy the text in the console window\n\nFixed Issues & Bugs\n * Cold staking Zap functionality\n * Converting between public and private balances\n * When converting between balances and selecting the Make payment button, a\n   popup will be displayed to unlock your wallet if it is encrypted. You then\n   need to confirm the transaction. If you click away from the popup, it will\n   disappear and the Make payment button will remain greyed out\n * Flagging of listings with 1 UTXO now works properly. Before the fix, it would\n   show as flagged but not be removed from your Listings page\n * Validation added that the balance transfer fee is subtracted from the amount\n   requested\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEarn PART by Participating in the Bug Bounty\nSince this build is the version of the marketplace that’s going to move up onto\nmainnet, it is this time accompanied by a bug bounty where you stand to earn\nPART coins for finding any bug related to the marketplace. This ensures that as\nmany testers as possible can try to break, hack into, or find vulnerabilities in\nthe Particl Open Marketplace before it launches and gets used with real funds.\n\nTo find all the details about this bug bounty, as well as the prizes, follow the\nlink below.\n\nParticl Open Marketplace Testnet Bug Bounty\n[https://particl.news/particl-open-marketplace-testnet-bug-bounty-d7594faaf81f]\nThe instructions to participate in this bug bounty are pretty simple: Download\nthe latest testnet build of the Open…\n[https://particl.news/particl-open-marketplace-testnet-bug-bounty-d7594faaf81f]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-open-marketplace-testnet-bug-bounty-d7594faaf81f]\n\nWhat’s Next?\nSince this is the final round of testing before the Particl Open Marketplace\nmoves up onto mainnet, the following days are going to be packed as the team\nprepares the Open Marketplace for its grand mainnet launch.

It was also announced that anyone\ncould start generating market keys and any of them could be submitted on Github\nto enable market capabilities on the official Particl Desktop 2.0 build.\n\nSo let’s have some fun with it!\nTo celebrate this important milestone, as well as the upcoming Trezor hardware\ndevice support for PART [https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/pull/316],\nthe Particl team will be giving away one (1) Trezor hardware device to 3 random\npeople who submit a set of market keys of their own. On top of this, the team\nwill also be giving away one (1) free limited edition t-shirt to every\nparticipant of this contest.\n\nLet’s first understand what this contest and giveaway are all about: the\ncreation and selection of market keys to be used as the default market on\nParticl’s Open Marketplace.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Content (Click Me)\n * What are Market Keys?\n * Create a Set of Market Keys\n * Submit Your Keys by Creating a Pull Request on Github\n * Contest Prizes\n * Contest Rules\n * How to Vote\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat are Market Keys?\nTo understand market keys, we need to refer back to the difference between user\nmarkets and the main interface of the Open Marketplace.\n\nMarket Keys are similar to PART address keys. There is a private and public key\nthat identifies a PART address — market keys work in the same way. Markets\nwithin Particl Desktop have a public and private key. Users can view, buy and\nsell items on all markets they know the keys of. The default market on Particl\nOpen Marketplace will have its public and private keys in the code and viewable\nby all clients. Users can also create other markets the same way. In these\nmarkets, only the clients or users invited to that market can view, buy and sell\nitems on it.

only because it’s\nParticl’s second anniversary. No, there is indeed some very exciting news that\nis now ready to be shared. Are you ready to unwrap that intel gift?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Open Marketplace Updates\nAll of the bugs that have been identified during the last testnet run (with\nblinded escrow) have been fixed. As it stands right now, we would feel 100%\nconfident to release, on mainnet, the Open Marketplace with blinded escrows. The\nproduct is stable, secure, and runs very smoothly.\n\nAll there is left to do, now, is to finish the integration of the RingCT\nprotocol into the escrow system of the marketplace so that all transactions can\nbe completely untraceable.\n\nNew Marketplace Testnet Build Releases Next Week\nAs you probably are well aware by now, the 16th of July hardfork has been\nsuccessfully completed, meaning both the RingCT and Bulletproofs protocols are\nnow available on mainnet.\n\nAnd because the OMP Library had initially been coded with RingCT in the first\nplace, the integration of this privacy protocol into the escrow system has been\npretty quick to go through. Of course, it was necessary for Quarkslab to\ncomplete its audit of MLSAG and Bulletproofs before integrating these two\nprotocols into a live version of the marketplace, but as the results were\npublished on the 5th of July (with the actual report being received by the\nParticl team a few days prior), it took just a few days for the Particl\ndevelopers to bake in the integration into the back-end.\n\nThe team is currently running tests and making a few tweaks that are required to\nensure the integration is as stable as the blinded escrow system was. We are\nestimating that these tweaks will only take a few days to complete, which would\nbring the next testnet build of the Open Marketplace, with full anon (RingCT)\nescrow, to somewhere within the next week. As always, this isn’t a hard\ndeadline, but this is what we are targeting and feeling confident about at this\nmoment.\n\nThis build will contain fixes for all the bugs and issues identified last week\nas well as the new RingCT-powered escrow system. This new testing round will\nallow you to see how the marketplace will look like once it hits mainnet, but it\nwill also allow you to earn a few PART!\n\nTwo Bug Bounties\nAt the same moment as the release of the new testnet build, two bug bounties\nwill officially start —one for the testnet marketplace build, and the other as a\npermanent, general bug bounty for mainnet.\n\nThe testnet bug bounty is pretty self-explanatory: earn PART for finding bugs\nthat remain in the latest version of the testnet build. This bug bounty, which \nwill run for two weeks, is put in place specifically to ensure that the first\nmainnet release of the Open Marketplace is as smooth as possible and that the\ncode is entirely secure. Note that, as bugs and issues are identified, it is\nlikely that there will be more than one build posted throughout the duration of\nthe bug bounty.\n\nThe second bounty, the permanent one, is a mainnet bounty that’s going to stay\nposted on Particl’s official website [http://particl.io]. This bounty is\ndedicated to incentivizing people to find bugs, vulnerabilities, or issues, and\nproperly disclose them to the Particl team in exchange for compensation for\ntheir work and contribution. More information about the bounty will be given\nwhen it is published on particl.io [http://particl.io], which is going to be on\nthe same day as the release of the next testnet marketplace build.\n\nGenerating Market Keys (Advanced Users can Start TODAY)\nAs the back-end code of the marketplace is now ready for launch, with RingCT\nescrow now baked in, it is now possible for anyone to start generating their\nvery own market keys using the repository (and its README.md file) linked just\nbelow.\n\nparticl/particl-market [https://github.com/particl/particl-market]\nParticl Marketplace. Contribute to particl/particl-market development by\ncreating an account on GitHub. [https://github.com/particl/particl-market]\ngithub.com [https://github.com/particl/particl-market]\n\n> Note: The Particl team has been building testnet and mainnet builds for\nconferences and community/internal testing using this repository, but they\nhaven’t been fully anon until after the hardfork.\nA market key, or Market ID, is a unique stream of characters and numbers which\ngives you access to a marketplace. These are, in reality, “private markets” that\nanyone can create. These markets can only be accessed by those who possess the\nkey, after which they gain full permissions over it (purchase products, list\nitems, flag undesirable content, etc).\n\nBootstrapping the Public Interface of the Open Marketplace\nGenerating a market key is important as the Particl team itself isn’t going to\nlaunch the marketplace. In fact, the Particl team is giving the opportunity for\nanyone in the community to create their own market key, push it on Github, and\nhave it be selected as the default key for the public interface of the\nmarketplace. In other words, the default key for the marketplace is going to be\n100% community-powered.\n\nYou see, on Particl, there is no difference between a private and a public\nmarket. The public interface of the Open Marketplace is merely a private market\nwhich has its key set as the default key on the Particl Desktop client. Any\nprivate market could be set as the default market, and this is the opportunity\nthat you will have as a community member.\n\nDon’t worry, there is no risk associated with integrating a community’s market\nkey as the default market. This is nothing like a trusted setup, and the market\nkey’s creator won’t have any sort of special access or permission over the\nmarketplace once the generated key gets merged. It’s not a master key.\n\nFor the next few days, it will be up to the more advanced users to figure out\nhow to generate market keys for themselves (following the instructions of the\nREADME.md file and the folder structure should give you enough hints on how to\ndo it). Then, in a few days, we’ll be giving out more details on how to do it so\nthat more people can join the fun.\n\nParticl Desktop 2.0 Releases on August 12, 2019\nOn the 12th of August, if everything goes well and no critical or significant\nbug is found on next week’s fully anon marketplace testnet build, Particl\nDesktop 2.0 will be released on mainnet.\n\nParticl Desktop 2.0, as it’s version number implies, is a pretty big milestone\nfor the project. Not only will it contain many new features (i.e. multi-wallets,\ncommunity proposals, etc) and UI/UX improvements that have been on testnet ever\nsince, but it will also be fully compatible with the Particl Open Marketplace,\non mainnet.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is it! This is the final burst to the finish line.\n\nWhat is tremendously exciting is that this isn’t actually the end by any means,\nbut rather the beginning of a new phase for Particl.\n\nWith the Particl Open Marketplace on mainnet fostering private, decentralized,\nand permissionless eCommerce, we are excited to see how vendors and buyers alike\nwill use the available features.\n\nSo get ready! The months of July and August will be ones to remember for a very\nlong time!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Second-Anniversary/1-3aInZ5BQOBAdR3s0ESIbig.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"let-s-celebrate-\">Let’s celebrate! ??</h3><p>Today is Particl’s second anniversary, and there are plenty of good reasons to take a moment and celebrate.</p><p>This blog post is definitely a celebratory one.

No, <strong>there is indeed some very exciting news that is now ready to be shared</strong>. Are you ready to unwrap that intel gift?</p><hr><h2 id=\"particl-open-marketplace-updates\">Particl Open Marketplace Updates</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Second-Anniversary/1-S_fPVIak-t6K7ukw7LoCDA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>All of the bugs that have been identified during the last testnet run (with blinded escrow) have been fixed. As it stands right now, <strong>we would feel 100% confident to release, on mainnet, the Open Marketplace with blinded escrows</strong>. The product is stable, secure, and runs very smoothly.</p><p>All there is left to do, now, is to finish the integration of the RingCT protocol into the escrow system of the marketplace so that all transactions can be completely untraceable.</p><h3 id=\"new-marketplace-testnet-build-releases-next-week\">New Marketplace Testnet Build Releases Next Week</h3><p>As you probably are well aware by now, the 16th of July hardfork has been successfully completed, meaning both the RingCT and Bulletproofs protocols are now available on mainnet.</p><p>And because the OMP Library had initially been coded with RingCT in the first place, the integration of this privacy protocol into the escrow system has been pretty quick to go through. Of course, it was necessary for Quarkslab to complete its audit of MLSAG and Bulletproofs before integrating these two protocols into a live version of the marketplace, but as the results were published on the 5th of July (with the actual report being received by the Particl team a few days prior), it took just a few days for the Particl developers to bake in the integration into the back-end.</p><p>The team is currently running tests and making a few tweaks that are required to ensure the integration is as stable as the blinded escrow system was. We are estimating that these tweaks will only take a few days to complete, which would bring the next testnet build of the Open Marketplace, with full anon (RingCT) escrow, to somewhere within the next week. As always, this isn’t a hard deadline, but this is what we are targeting and feeling confident about at this moment.</p><p>This build will contain fixes for all the bugs and issues identified last week as well as the new RingCT-powered escrow system. This new testing round will allow you to see how the marketplace will look like once it hits mainnet, but it will also allow you to earn a few PART!</p><h3 id=\"two-bug-bounties\">Two Bug Bounties</h3><p>At the same moment as the release of the new testnet build, two bug bounties will officially start — <strong>one for the testnet marketplace build, and the other as a permanent, general bug bounty for mainnet</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>testnet bug bounty</strong> is pretty self-explanatory: earn PART for finding bugs that remain in the latest version of the testnet build. This bug bounty, which <strong>will run for two weeks</strong>, is put in place specifically to ensure that the first mainnet release of the Open Marketplace is as smooth as possible and that the code is entirely secure. Note that, as bugs and issues are identified, it is likely that there will be more than one build posted throughout the duration of the bug bounty.</p><p>The second bounty, the permanent one, is a <strong>mainnet bounty</strong> that’s going to stay posted on <a href=\"http://particl.io\">Particl’s official website</a>. This bounty is dedicated to incentivizing people to find bugs, vulnerabilities, or issues, and properly disclose them to the Particl team in exchange for compensation for their work and contribution. More information about the bounty will be given when it is published on <a href=\"http://particl.io\">particl.io</a>, which is going to be on the same day as the release of the next testnet marketplace build.</p><h3 id=\"generating-market-keys-advanced-users-can-start-today-\">Generating Market Keys (Advanced Users can Start TODAY)</h3><p>As the back-end code of the marketplace is now ready for launch, with RingCT escrow now baked in, it is now possible for anyone to start generating their very own market keys using the repository (and its README.md file) linked just below.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-market\"><strong>particl/particl-market</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-market\"><em>Particl Marketplace. Contribute to particl/particl-market development by creating an account on GitHub.</em></a><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-market\">github.com</a></p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> The Particl team has been building testnet and mainnet builds for conferences and community/internal testing using this repository, but they haven’t been fully anon until after the hardfork.</blockquote><p>A market key, or Market ID, is a unique stream of characters and numbers which gives you access to a marketplace. These are, in reality, “private markets” that anyone can create. These markets can only be accessed by those who possess the key, after which they gain full permissions over it (purchase products, list items, flag undesirable content, etc).</p><h3 id=\"bootstrapping-the-public-interface-of-the-open-marketplace\">Bootstrapping the Public Interface of the Open Marketplace</h3><p>Generating a market key is important as the Particl team itself isn’t going to launch the marketplace. In fact, the Particl team is giving the opportunity for anyone in the community to create their own market key, push it on Github, and have it be selected as the default key for the public interface of the marketplace. In other words, the default key for the marketplace is going to be 100% community-powered.</p><p>You see, on Particl, there is no difference between a private and a public market. The public interface of the Open Marketplace is merely a private market which has its key set as the default key on the Particl Desktop client. Any private market could be set as the default market, and this is the opportunity that you will have as a community member.</p><p>Don’t worry, there is no risk associated with integrating a community’s market key as the default market. This is nothing like a trusted setup, and the market key’s creator won’t have any sort of special access or permission over the marketplace once the generated key gets merged. It’s not a master key.</p><p>For the next few days, it will be up to the more advanced users to figure out how to generate market keys for themselves (following the instructions of the README.md file and the folder structure should give you enough hints on how to do it). Then, in a few days, we’ll be giving out more details on how to do it so that more people can join the fun.</p><h2 id=\"particl-desktop-2-0-releases-on-august-12-2019\">Particl Desktop 2.0 Releases on August 12, 2019</h2><p>On the 12th of August, if everything goes well and no critical or significant bug is found on next week’s fully anon marketplace testnet build, Particl Desktop 2.0 will be released on mainnet.</p><p>Particl Desktop 2.0, as it’s version number implies, is a pretty big milestone for the project. Not only will it contain many new features (i.e. multi-wallets, community proposals, etc) and UI/UX improvements that have been on testnet ever since, but it will also be fully compatible with the Particl Open Marketplace, on mainnet.</p><hr><p>This is it! This is the final burst to the finish line.</p><p>What is tremendously exciting is that this isn’t actually the end by any means, but rather the beginning of a new phase for Particl.</p><p>With the Particl Open Marketplace on mainnet fostering private, decentralized, and permissionless eCommerce, we are excited to see how vendors and buyers alike will use the available features.</p><p><strong>So get ready! The months of July and August will be ones to remember for a very long time!</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Second-Anniversary/1-fJlNhXY7IcQiUzAyqmbTGA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":["kg-card","kg-image-card"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Second-Anniversary/1-3aInZ5BQOBAdR3s0ESIbig.jpeg","className":["kg-image"],"alt":""},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"let-s-celebrate-"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Let’s celebrate! ??"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Today is Particl’s second anniversary, and there are plenty of good reasons to take a moment and celebrate."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This blog post is definitely a celebratory one.

In short, \nhold funds in Anon balances and make RingCT transactions every once in a while.\n\nRingCT is a privacy protocol that becomes increasingly effective as more and\nmore people use it. This is one of the main reasons why the Particl Open\nMarketplace will make all transaction private by default using the protocol\n(more marketplace users automatically means a stronger privacy).\n\nTo help the network and support its privacy, it is recommended to leave a\nportion of your coins in Anon balances. This helps the network by providing more\noutputs that can be used by other users within their ring groups. In other\nwords, the more coins being held in Anon balances, the more outputs can be used\nby everyone else as decoys for their transactions.\n\nRingCT also gets even stronger when you make a few transactions here and there.\nThat’s because the protocol tends to prioritize recent outputs in order to \nmitigate the traceability of coins [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/].\n\nAdditionally, if you want to anonymize the coins you currently hold properly, it\nis recommended that you do multiple RingCT transactions (Anon balances to Anon \nbalances) to yourself before transferring coins held in your Anon balance back\nto your Public balance. That’s because an observer can tell the maximum size of\na recently created anon output by looking at the amounts of the non-blinded\ninputs that went into it. Alternatively, you can also wait some time after your \nPublic to Anon balance transfer so that your RingCT outputs can be used by\nvarious ring groups. That will add more possibilities, making the real origin\nmore difficult to trace.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll Set for the Open Marketplace Mainnet Launch\nThe RingCT and Bulletproofs hardfork is an important step leading up to the\nrelease of the Particl Open Marketplace. As the marketplace decentralized\napplication works exclusively using Anon balances, meaning that you can only\npurchase and sell items using RingCT transactions, now is the time to start\nconverting some of your coins into Anon balances and get ready for the launch!\n\nNot only will you help the network and its privacy level, but you’ll also be\nfully ready to use the Particl Open Marketplace as soon as it comes out!\n\nThe Particl Team","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/RingCT---Bulletproofs-Now-Available-on-Mainnet/1-a6cQyigLiIO9mv6qG4r8tQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>It’s official!

These articles should give you a good base knowledge\nof the more technical features of the platform and can serve as pointers when\nexplaining a feature to a new community member or user of the platform.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency with varying levels of anonymity. In\nfact, using two different privacy protocols, users of the PART coin can choose\nbetween 3 types of transactions (public, blinded, anonymous) when making\npayments to other people or to addresses they own. Each of these transaction\ntypes carries its own level of privacy as well as its own set of properties.\n\nThis article will break down each of these transaction types and go into more\ndetails about them, explaining why and when you should use them. Privacy\ntransactions on Particl should have no secret for you anymore after reading\nthis!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Content (Click Me)\n * Public Transactions\n * Blinded Transactions (CT)\n * Rangeproofs\n * Bulletproofs\n * Anonymous Transactions  (RingCT)\n * Ring Signatures (MLSAG)\n * How to Make an Anonymous Transaction (RingCT) on Particl Desktop\n * Keeping a Good Level of Privacy\n * Stealth Addresses\n * CT + RingCT Together = Infinite Possibilities\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPublic Transactions\n * Privacy level: Low\n * Transaction cost: Low (~0.000346 PART)\n * Segwit: Yes (Reduces transactions weight by ~20%)\n * Trusted setup: No\n * Programmable outputs: Yes\n\n(Fee: 0.000346 PART)By default, when not manually selecting any privacy protocol\nto obfuscate your transactions on the blockchain, transactions are sent out as\n“public transactions”. And because Particl is based on the Bitcoin codebase,\nthey are recorded on the blockchain the same way you would expect Bitcoin\ntransactions to be recorded.\n\nContrary to what a lot of people claim, Bitcoin is not anonymous. In fact, it is\nquite the contrary. Bitcoin transactions (and Particl transactions, by proxy)\nare what we call pseudonymous transactions and they are pretty transparent.\nInstead of each transaction being tied to a personal identity, it is instead\ntied to an alphanumerical pseudonym composed of various different numbers and\ncharacters.\n\nWhile that is probably enough to protect your data from uninterested parties,\nthe advent of solid blockchain analysis tools and protocols makes it way too\neasy for any curious and motivated party to start digging into the blockchain\nand tracking users. That becomes dramatically easier the moment you make a\npayment to any service that ties addresses to identities (exchanges, payment\nprocessors, vendors, etc.).\n\nFor this reason, the Particl team has implemented two different privacy\nprotocols that make currency transactions hidden on the blockchain. Both of\nthese protocols do not require any trusted setup and have common denominators,\nbut also have different purposes within the Particl platform as well as\ndifferent levels of privacy.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBlinded Transactions — Confidential Transactions (CT)\nConfidential Transactions\n[https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions]\nElements - An open source, sidechain-capable blockchain platform.\nelementsproject.org\n[https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions]\n\n * Privacy level: Medium (Transacting amounts are hidden)\n * Transaction cost: Medium (~0.001962 PART)\n * Segwit: Yes (Reduces CT transactions weight by ~48%)\n * Bulletproofs: Yes (Reduces range proofs size by ~70%)\n * Trusted setup: No\n * Programmable outputs: Yes\n * Whitepaper: \n   https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\n\n(Fee: 0.001962 PART)Blinded transactions are currency transactions that have their transacting\namounts hidden on the blockchain and only known by the two transacting parties\n(the sender and the receiver). This type of transaction uses the Confidential\nTransactions (CT)\n[https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation] \nprivacy protocol which cryptographically guarantees that no more coins can be\nspent than are available. It uses a zero-knowledge proofing method that does not\nrequire any trusted setup or direct interaction with the party.\n\nSending a blinded transaction (CT) on Particl DesktopThis privacy protocol is\nentirely trustless, meaning that it doesn’t require any trusted setup\n[https://minezcash.com/zcash-trusted-setup/] and doesn’t require the assistance\nof any intermediary to process transactions. The problem with privacy protocols\nrequiring so-called “trusted setups [https://minezcash.com/zcash-trusted-setup/]\n” is that they require a one-time setup that involves the generation and use of \nmaster keys. Users then need to put trust in whoever generated those keys to\ndestroy them right after they are done setting up the protocol, otherwise, those\nkeys could be used to create an unlimited amount of coins and do so without\nanyone noticing it.\n\nTo prove and ensure that amounts being sent and received are positive and the\ncorrect ones, Confidential Transactions use what we call a rangeproof. In other\nwords, a rangeproof is able to determine that the amount of coins sent in a\ngiven transaction is between two values, but it’s not able to tell exactly what\nthat amount is.\n\nRangeproofs\nA rangeproof is a cryptographic protocol used to verify that a payment amount is\npositive or zero, without actually revealing the amount transferred in the\ntransaction. Without rangeproofs, the amounts in a transaction could be set so\nlarge that it would be considered a negative number, thus allowing coins to be\ngenerated out of thin air. An attacker could add a negative amount output and\nanother different output, generating extra coins. The negative output would make\nthe commitments still sum to zero.\n\nThe downside with rangeproofs is that they are quite heavy on the blockchain.\nTheir size scales linearly with the number of outputs in a transaction and the\nbits in the proof’s range. In fact, due to their heavy nature, rangeproofs take\nup the majority of a blinded transaction’s size.\n\nThis inconvenient reality means anyone looking into using the protocol will have\nto execute bigger transactions than regular, public ones. A bigger transaction\nnot only means higher fees, but it also means that the size of the blockchain\ngrows exponentially along with usage. In other words, it gets more inconvenient\nto run the blockchain as more and more CT transactions get recorded on it.\n\nThis scalability issue is one of the main reasons why the Particl team has\nrefrained from moving its RingCT implementation onto Particl’s mainnet. Because\nthis project has a long-term vision in mind, it was preferred to wait until a\nproper solution to this scalability problem was found. And then came\nBulletproofs.\n\nBulletproofs\n * Whitepaper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf\n * Report from Quarkslab audit into Particl’s implementation of Bulletproofs: \n   https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\n\nBulletproofs is a new generation of rangeproofs that scale logarithmically\nrather than linearly. In its whitepaper [https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf],\nthey are referred to as non-interactive zero-knowledge short proofs. In simple\nterms, Bulletproofs is a groundbreaking improvement over regular rangeproofs as \nthey reduce their size by around ~70%. And, because rangeproofs make up for the\nmajority of a CT transaction size, it in turn reduces transaction fees and the\nspace they take on the blockchain by the same ratio.\n\n> Fun fact: The term “Bulletproofs” was coined by Shashank Agrawal when he\ndescribed the new type of rangeproof as “short like a bullet, with bulletproof\nsecurity assumption”.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnonymous Transactions — RingCT\n * Privacy level: High (Transacting amounts and participants are hidden)\n * Transaction cost: Medium to high, depending on the number of mixins used in\n   the ring signatures or the size of the rings\n * Transaction cost for low privacy setting: ~0.003232 PART\n * Transaction cost for high privacy setting: ~0.009032 PART\n * Segwit: Yes (Reduces transaction weight by ~47%)\n * Bulletproofs: Yes (Reduces rangeproofs size by ~70%)\n * Trusted setup: No\n * Programmable outputs: No\n * Whitepaper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf\n\n(Fee: 0.005708 PART for 8 ring members and 2 inputs)Anonymous transactions, or Anon transactions, as referred to in Particl Desktop,\ntake privacy to the next level by not only hiding the transacting amounts but\nalso the identity of the transacting parties (the sender and the receiver). This\ntype of transaction uses the RingCT privacy protocol, a protocol made popular by\nMonero but adapted to work with the Bitcoin codebase by the Particl team. This\nallows the platform to benefit from the industry-leading privacy protocol that\nis RingCT but still leverage the security, stability, and developer community of\nBitcoin. In other words, RingCT on the Bitcoin codebase is like having your cake\nand eating it too. The good, without the bad.\n\nSending an anon transaction (RingCT) with 22 ring members on Particl DesktopGood\nexamples of this include RingCT being able to be used, with the help of special\nscripts, on atomic swaps, decentralized applications (i.e. Particl’s Open\nMarketplace), the Lightning Network, and etc. It also enables RingCT to be\ndirectly linked to CT transactions so that it can reach full programmability, as\nwe’ll see later in this article.\n\nJust like blinded transactions, which use the CT protocol, anonymous\ntransactions are entirely trustless and don’t rely on any sort of trusted setup.\nIt’s important to note that RingCT transactions are also a bit bigger than\nConfidential Transactions, although not by a big margin. This is due to the\naddition of ring signatures (MLSAG) into the mix.\n\n> Fun fact: RingCT was initially implemented on top of the Cryptonote codebase\n(Monero). The Particl team is the first team to ever develop a custom\nimplementation that could work on any other codebase, in this case, the Bitcoin\ncodebase.\nRing Signatures (MLSAG)\n * Report from Quarkslab audit into Particl’s implementation of MLSAG: \n   https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\n\nMultilayered Linkable Spontaneous Ad-Hoc Group Signatures (MLSAG), or ring\nsignatures, is the Ring part of RingCT. It is a type of digital signature that\nis performed by many outputs at once within a given group of RingCT outputs \n(represented by Anon balances, on Particl Desktop). It is then impossible for\nany observer to tell which of the participating outputs within that signature is\nthe output actually sending out the transaction.\n\nWikipedia describes ring signatures as follow\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_signature]: “A ring signature is a type of \ndigital signature [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature] that can be\nperformed by any member of a group of users that each have keys. Therefore, a\nmessage signed with a ring signature is endorsed by someone in a particular\ngroup of people. One of the security properties of a ring signature is that it\nshould be computationally infeasible to determine which of the group members’\nkeys was used to produce the signature.”.\n\nIn RingCT’s case, the digital signature used to execute a transaction could have\noriginated from any member of the ring group. Users put some of their funds\nwithin an Anon balance. Funds held within an Anon balance are used to execute\nRingCT transactions. Before a transaction is executed, the protocol anonymously\nsigns it by using other RingCT outputs as decoys and produces a signature that,\nwhen verified, looks like it could have been initiated by any of the owners of\nthe RingCT outputs used by the ring group. It is not possible to know who really\nmade the transaction because it could be anyone that has an output that’s being\nused by the ring group as a decoy.\n\nThis effectively anonymizes all values contained within a transaction— the\namount transferred as well as both the transaction’s sender and receiver. It\nalso arms transacting parties with a very strong plausible deniability (1\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability], 2\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption]).\n\nHow to Make an Anonymous Transaction (RingCT) on Particl Desktop\nA RingCT transaction containing 24 ring membersOn Particl Desktop, it is\npossible to pick the number of members you want to have within the ring group \nyou’re going to use to anonymize your transactions. On the client, this is\nreferred to as NO. OF RING SIGS.\n\nWhat it means is simple, for every input used to generate your transaction, a\nnumber of other outputs will be used to create a digital signature that could\nhave been signed by any of the 24 participants. In the screenshot just above,\nthe value 24 is selected. This means 23 fake outputs, and 1 real one (the sender\nof the transaction) will be used to obfuscate the transaction (if it only has 1\ninput). If the transaction uses 3 inputs, it means 3 signatures, one for each\ninput, with 3 different ring groups of 24 participants each, will be generated\nin order to execute the transactions. This may sound complicated, but don’t\nworry, Particl Desktop does everything for you and makes RingCT transactions as\neasy to send as any other type of transaction.\n\nTo make a RingCT transaction, simply go into your Send/Convert tab, choose the\nAnontransaction type, click the Advanced Options, and use the PRIVACY LEVEL (NO.\nOF RING SIGS) slider that appears at the bottom left corner of the page. The\nvalue you pick will be equal to the number of ring members that will be part of\nyour ring group. In reality, you can just leave the slider untouched and use the\ndefault level of privacy (8 ring members). This represents a good balance\nbetween privacy and cost.\n\n> Note: The more inputs are consumed to execute a RingCT transaction, the more\nexpensive it gets, but also the more private it is. Also, the more ring members\n(RING SIGS) is selected before executing a transaction, the more expensive it\ngets, but also the more private it is. If you don’t care about the cost of a\ntransaction and just want maximum privacy, form transactions with as many ring\nmembers as possible and with as many inputs as possible.\nKeeping a Good Level of Privacy\nAs a general rule of thumb and in theory, RingCT gets more private as more\npeople convert their public balances into Anon balances, thus creating more Anon \noutputs to be used by ring groups for RingCT transactions. That’s because RingCT\nrelies on other people’s outputs to plausibly deny which output actually signed\na transaction, and the more RingCT outputs there are to sign transactions, the\nstronger the privacy and plausible deniability aspect of RingCT gets.\n\nBut, while outputs are randomly picked from any Anon outputs in the chain,\nthey’re most often picked from the most recent RingCT transactions. The reason\nthe protocol behaves this way is in response to this research paper\n[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/] which demonstrates that real inputs can be\nguessed to be the most recent ones if all the “mixins” are much deeper in the\nchain and haven’t had transactions for a while.\n\nFor this reason, it is recommended that all users keep with them an Anon balance \nwhich can be automatically put to use by the network (at no fee to the users, of\ncourse). Additionally, it is also recommended that users transact as much as\npossible with Anon transactions so that it can contribute to enhancing the\nentire network’s privacy. Note that none of this is required in order to execute\na RingCT transaction, but the more people do it, the stronger and more resilient\nit becomes for everyone.\n\nThis is also one of the main reason why Particl’s Open Marketplace is going to\nuse RingCT transactions, by default, on all marketplace transactions. The best\nway to increase the RingCT pool is through transactional activity and actual\nusage of the technology, so making it default on what will become the platform’s\nmain application is only logical and will go a long way into making Particl’s\nRingCT protocol a very solid one.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStealth Addresses\nAdditionally, Particl allows anyone to use stealth addresses instead of regular,\npublic addresses. Stealth addresses are one-time addresses that increase privacy\nbecause only the owner of a stealth address can tell if an output belongs to it\nor not. What is meant by “one-time address” is that a stealth address can\nreceive payments many times, but each time, it generates a new ‘one-time\naddress’ for that output/transaction.\n\nWithout knowing the private key of an address, an observer won’t be able to link\nand guess which outputs match which stealth address. This helps in protecting\nthe identity of the receiver of a transaction.\n\nOn their own, stealth addresses probably aren’t enough to protect transactions\ninformation from any well-funded and motivated observer (i.e. state actor), but\nwhen combined with stronger privacy protocols such as CT or RingCT, it provides\nyet another layer of privacy for the user.\n\nAs it currently stands, blinded (CT) and anon (RingCT) transactions can only be\nexecuted to stealth addresses.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCT + RingCT Together = Infinite Possibilities\nBoth privacy protocols have their own pros and cons, but one of the most notable\ndifferences between the two Particl implementations is the fact that CT has\nprogrammable outputs while RingCT does not. What that means is that RingCT, as\nis, simply cannot be used within smart-contracts. What that does not mean,\nhowever, is that it cannot be used within decentralized applications. How is\nthat possible, if RingCT cannot be used in smart-contracts? This is one of the\nbig reasons why Particl keeps both CT and RingCT protocols on its network\ninstead of just one of them.\n\nIn fact, because CT transactions have programmable outputs, they can be used in\nsmart-contracts and then easily be linked to RingCT transactions. The benefit of\nParticl’s implementation is that the outputs can be spent from RingCT to CT for\nanything requiring a script, and then be sent back to RingCT.\n\nThe best example to illustrate this concept is with Particl’s Open Marketplace.\nIt is a private-by-default marketplace that uses RingCT to completely anonymize\nmarketplace transactions. What few people know is that the marketplace actually\nuses a combination of RingCT (the transaction) and CT (the smart-contract) for\nits escrow system, not RingCT.\n\nThat’s because the marketplace’s escrow system is based on smart-contract\nfunctionality, thus requiring transactions to have programmable outputs (hence\nwhy it uses CT). However, to interact with the smart-contract, users need to\nsend a RingCT transaction to it, which the marketplace then automatically\nconverts into a CT transaction for the duration of the escrow. Once it gets\nreleased by the two transacting parties, the transaction is finalized as a\nRingCT transaction.\n\n> A RingCT output is converted to a CT output which in turn forms the inputs of\nthe escrow contract. When the escrow is ready to be released or refunded, it\nwill directly be released to a RingCT output.— Kewde [https://github.com/kewde/]\n, Particl Developer and OMP Library\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/]Author\nThis is just one example of how RingCT can be given its full potential and\nleverage the Particl and Bitcoin ecosystems using its CT counterpart. The same\nsort of technique can be applied to integrate RingCT into other protocols or\nservices such as atomic swaps, the Lightning Network, other decentralized\napplications, and etc.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you liked this article, share it wide and beyond and stay tuned as more \nParticl Explained articles will be posted on particl.news [http://particl.news] \nin the future.\n\nThe Particl team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

It is a <strong>type of digital signature that is performed by many outputs at once within a given group of RingCT outputs</strong> (represented by <em>Anon</em> balances, on Particl Desktop). It is then <strong>impossible for any observer to tell which of the participating outputs within that signature is the output actually sending out the transaction</strong>.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_signature\">Wikipedia describes ring signatures as follow</a>: “<em>A ring signature is a type of </em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature\"><em>digital signature</em></a><em> that can be performed by any member of a group of users that each have keys. Therefore, a message signed with a ring signature is endorsed by someone in a particular group of people. One of the security properties of a ring signature is that it should be computationally infeasible to determine which of the group members’ keys was used to produce the signature.</em>”.</p><p>In RingCT’s case, the digital signature used to execute a transaction could have originated from any member of the <em>ring group</em>. Users put some of their funds within an Anon balance. Funds held within an Anon balance are used to execute RingCT transactions. Before a transaction is executed, the protocol anonymously signs it by <strong>using other RingCT outputs as</strong> <strong>decoys</strong> and produces a signature that, when verified, looks like it could have been initiated by any of the owners of the RingCT outputs used by the <em>ring group</em>. <strong>It is not possible to know who really made the transaction because it could be anyone that has an output that’s being used by the </strong><em><strong>ring group </strong></em><strong>as a decoy</strong>.</p><p><strong>This effectively anonymizes all values contained within a transaction</strong>— the amount transferred as well as both the transaction’s sender and receiver. It also arms transacting parties with a very strong <strong>plausible deniability</strong> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability\"><strong>1</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption\"><strong>2</strong></a>).</p><h3 id=\"how-to-make-an-anonymous-transaction-ringct-on-particl-desktop\">How to Make an Anonymous Transaction (RingCT) on Particl Desktop</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained---Private-Transactions/1-9xtnttI8YayVWxIaQVlBgw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>A RingCT transaction containing 24 ring members</figcaption></figure><p>On Particl Desktop, it is possible to pick the number of members you want to have within the <em>ring group</em> you’re going to use to anonymize your transactions. On the client, this is referred to as <em>NO. OF RING SIGS</em>.</p><p>What it means is simple, <strong>for every input used to generate your transaction, a number of other outputs will be used to create a digital signature that could have been signed by any of the 24 participants</strong>. In the screenshot just above, the value 24 is selected. This means 23 fake outputs, and 1 real one (the sender of the transaction) will be used to obfuscate the transaction (if it only has 1 input). If the transaction uses 3 inputs, it means 3 signatures, one for each input, with 3 different <em>ring groups </em>of 24 participants each,<em> </em>will be generated in order to execute the transactions. This may sound complicated, but don’t worry, Particl Desktop does everything for you and makes RingCT transactions as easy to send as any other type of transaction.</p><p><strong>To make a RingCT transaction</strong>, simply go into your Send/Convert tab, choose the Anontransaction type, click the Advanced Options, and use the PRIVACY LEVEL (NO. OF RING SIGS) slider that appears at the bottom left corner of the page. The value you pick will be equal to the number of <em>ring members</em> that will be part of your <em>ring group</em>. In reality, you can just leave the slider untouched and use the default level of privacy (8 <em>ring members</em>). This represents a good balance between privacy and cost.</p><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>The more inputs are consumed to execute a RingCT transaction, the more expensive it gets, but also the more private it is. Also, the more ring members (RING SIGS) is selected before executing a transaction, the more expensive it gets, but also the more private it is. If you don’t care about the cost of a transaction and just want maximum privacy, form transactions with as many ring members as possible and with as many inputs as possible.</blockquote><h3 id=\"keeping-a-good-level-of-privacy\">Keeping a Good Level of Privacy</h3><p>As a general rule of thumb and in theory, <strong>RingCT gets more private as more people convert their public balances into </strong>Anon<strong> balances</strong>, thus creating more <em>Anon</em> outputs to be used by <em>ring groups</em> for RingCT transactions. That’s because RingCT relies on other people’s outputs to plausibly deny which output actually signed a transaction, and <strong>the more RingCT outputs there are to sign transactions, the stronger the privacy and plausible deniability aspect of RingCT gets</strong>.</p><p>But, while outputs are randomly picked from any Anon outputs in the chain, they’re most often picked from the most recent RingCT transactions. The reason the protocol behaves this way is in response to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/\"><strong>this research paper</strong></a><strong> </strong>which demonstrates that real inputs can be guessed to be the most recent ones if all the “mixins” are much deeper in the chain and haven’t had transactions for a while.</p><p>For this reason, <strong>it is recommended that all users keep with them an </strong>Anon<strong> balance</strong> which can be automatically put to use by the network (at no fee to the users, of course). Additionally, <strong>it is also recommended that users transact as much as possible with </strong>Anon<strong> transactions</strong> so that it can contribute to enhancing the entire network’s privacy. Note that none of this is required in order to execute a RingCT transaction, but the more people do it, the stronger and more resilient it becomes for everyone.</p><p>This is also one of the main reason why Particl’s Open Marketplace is going to use RingCT transactions, by default, on all marketplace transactions. The best way to increase the RingCT pool is through transactional activity and actual usage of the technology, so making it default on what will become the platform’s main application is only logical and will go a long way into making Particl’s RingCT protocol a very solid one.</p><hr><h2 id=\"stealth-addresses\">Stealth Addresses</h2><p>Additionally, Particl allows anyone to use stealth addresses instead of regular, public addresses. Stealth addresses are one-time addresses that increase privacy because <strong>only the owner of a stealth address can tell if an output belongs to it or not</strong>. What is meant by “one-time address” is that a stealth address can receive payments many times, but each time, it generates a new ‘one-time address’ for that output/transaction.</p><p>Without knowing the private key of an address, an observer won’t be able to link and guess which outputs match which stealth address. <strong>This helps in protecting the identity of the receiver of a transaction.</strong></p><p>On their own, stealth addresses probably aren’t enough to protect transactions information from any well-funded and motivated observer (i.e. state actor), but when combined with stronger privacy protocols such as CT or RingCT, it provides yet another layer of privacy for the user.</p><p><strong>As it currently stands, blinded (CT) and anon (RingCT) transactions can only be executed to stealth addresses.</strong></p><hr><h2 id=\"ct-ringct-together-infinite-possibilities\">CT + RingCT Together = Infinite Possibilities</h2><p>Both privacy protocols have their own pros and cons, but one of the most notable differences between the two Particl implementations is the fact that CT has programmable outputs while RingCT does not. What that means is that RingCT, as is, simply cannot be used within smart-contracts. What that <strong>does not</strong> mean, however, is that it cannot be used within decentralized applications. How is that possible, if RingCT cannot be used in smart-contracts? <strong>This is one of the big reasons why Particl keeps both CT and RingCT protocols on its network instead of just one of them.</strong></p><p>In fact, because CT transactions have programmable outputs, they can be used in smart-contracts and then easily be linked to RingCT transactions. The benefit of Particl’s implementation is that the outputs can be spent from RingCT to CT for anything requiring a script, and then be sent back to RingCT.</p><p>The best example to illustrate this concept is with Particl’s Open Marketplace. It is a <strong>private-by-default marketplace that uses RingCT to completely anonymize marketplace transactions</strong>. What few people know is that the marketplace actually uses a combination of RingCT (the transaction) and CT (the smart-contract) for its escrow system, not RingCT.</p><p>That’s because the marketplace’s escrow system is based on smart-contract functionality, thus requiring transactions to have programmable outputs (hence why it uses CT). However, to interact with the smart-contract, users need to send a RingCT transaction to it, which the marketplace then automatically converts into a CT transaction for the duration of the escrow. Once it gets released by the two transacting parties, the transaction is finalized as a RingCT transaction.</p><blockquote>A RingCT output is converted to a CT output which in turn forms the inputs of the escrow contract. When the escrow is ready to be released or refunded, it will directly be released to a RingCT output.— <a href=\"https://github.com/kewde/\"><strong>Kewde</strong></a><strong>, Particl Developer and </strong><a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/\"><strong>OMP Library</strong></a><strong> Author</strong></blockquote><p>This is just one example of how RingCT can be given its full potential and leverage the Particl and Bitcoin ecosystems using its CT counterpart. The same sort of technique can be applied to integrate RingCT into other protocols or services such as atomic swaps, the Lightning Network, other decentralized applications, and etc.</p><hr><p>If you liked this article, share it wide and beyond and stay tuned as more <em>Particl Explained </em>articles will be posted on <a href=\"http://particl.news\"><strong>particl.news</strong></a> in the future.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained---Private-Transactions/1-wZwosKBtAh5-VPGJZgliQg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p><strong>The Particl team</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

And because Particl is based on the Bitcoin codebase, they are recorded on the blockchain the same way you would expect Bitcoin transactions to be recorded.</p><p><strong>Contrary to what a lot of people claim, Bitcoin is not anonymous</strong>. In fact, it is quite the contrary. Bitcoin transactions (and Particl transactions, by proxy) are what we call <strong>pseudonymous</strong> transactions and they are pretty transparent. Instead of each transaction being tied to a personal identity, it is instead tied to an alphanumerical pseudonym composed of various different numbers and characters.</p><p>While that is probably enough to protect your data from uninterested parties, the advent of solid blockchain analysis tools and protocols makes it way too easy for any curious and motivated party to start digging into the blockchain and tracking users. That becomes dramatically easier the moment you make a payment to any service that ties addresses to identities (exchanges, payment processors, vendors, etc.).</p><p>For this reason, the Particl team has implemented two different privacy protocols that make currency transactions hidden on the blockchain. Both of these protocols do not require any trusted setup and have common denominators, but also have different purposes within the Particl platform as well as different levels of privacy.</p><hr><h2 id=\"blinded-transactions-confidential-transactions-ct-\">Blinded Transactions — Confidential Transactions (CT)</h2><p><a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions\"><strong>Confidential Transactions</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions\"><em>Elements - An open source, sidechain-capable blockchain platform.</em>elementsproject.org</a></p><ul><li><em>Privacy level: <strong>Medium (Transacting amounts are hidden)</strong></em></li><li><em>Transaction cost: <strong>Medium (~0.001962 PART)</strong></em></li><li><em>Segwit: <strong>Yes (Reduces CT transactions weight by ~48%)</strong></em></li><li><em>Bulletproofs: <strong>Yes (Reduces range proofs size by ~70%)</strong></em></li><li><em>Trusted setup: <strong>No</strong></em></li><li><em>Programmable outputs: <strong>Yes</strong></em></li><li><em>Whitepaper: </em><a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\"><em><strong>https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation</strong></em></a></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained---Private-Transactions/1-APY4j-vFVOhMr-V0rm30xQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>(Fee: 0.001962 PART)</figcaption></figure><p>Blinded transactions are <strong>currency transactions that have their transacting amounts hidden on the blockchain</strong> and only known by the two transacting parties (the sender and the receiver).

It uses a zero-knowledge proofing method that <strong>does not require any trusted setup or direct interaction with the party</strong>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained---Private-Transactions/1-q2ZhXl4uqiCXm9IfbIAQuA.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Sending a blinded transaction (CT) on Particl Desktop</figcaption></figure><p>This privacy protocol is entirely trustless, meaning that it doesn’t require any <a href=\"https://minezcash.com/zcash-trusted-setup/\"><strong>trusted setup</strong></a> and doesn’t require the assistance of any intermediary to process transactions. The problem with privacy protocols requiring so-called “<a href=\"https://minezcash.com/zcash-trusted-setup/\"><strong>trusted setups</strong></a>” is that they require a one-time setup that involves the generation and use of <em>master keys</em>. Users then need to put trust in whoever generated those keys to destroy them right after they are done setting up the protocol, otherwise, those keys could be used to create an unlimited amount of coins and do so without anyone noticing it.</p><p>To prove and ensure that amounts being sent and received are positive and the correct ones, Confidential Transactions use what we call a <strong>rangeproof. </strong>In other words, a rangeproof is able to determine that the amount of coins sent in a given transaction is between two values, but it’s not able to tell exactly what that amount is.</p><h3 id=\"rangeproofs\">Rangeproofs</h3><p>A rangeproof is a cryptographic protocol used to<strong> verify that a payment amount is positive or zero, without actually revealing the amount transferred in the transaction</strong>. Without rangeproofs, the amounts in a transaction could be set so large that it would be considered a negative number, thus allowing coins to be generated out of thin air. An attacker could add a negative amount output and another different output, generating extra coins. The negative output would make the commitments still sum to zero.</p><p>The downside with rangeproofs is that they are quite heavy on the blockchain. Their size scales linearly with the number of outputs in a transaction and the bits in the proof’s range. In fact, due to their heavy nature, <strong>rangeproofs take up the majority of a blinded transaction’s size</strong>.</p><p>This inconvenient reality means anyone looking into using the protocol will have to execute bigger transactions than regular, public ones. A bigger transaction not only means higher fees, but it also means that the size of the blockchain grows exponentially along with usage. In other words, it gets more inconvenient to run the blockchain as more and more CT transactions get recorded on it.</p><p>This scalability issue is one of the main reasons why the Particl team has refrained from moving its RingCT implementation onto Particl’s mainnet. Because this project has a long-term vision in mind, it was preferred to wait until a proper solution to this scalability problem was found. And then came Bulletproofs.</p><h3 id=\"bulletproofs\">Bulletproofs</h3><ul><li><em>Whitepaper: </em><a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf\"><em><strong>https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf</strong></em></a></li><li><em>Report from Quarkslab audit into Particl’s implementation of Bulletproofs: </em><a href=\"https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\"><em><strong>https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf</strong></em></a></li></ul><p>Bulletproofs is a new generation of rangeproofs that scale logarithmically rather than linearly.

It is then <strong>impossible for any observer to tell which of the participating outputs within that signature is the output actually sending out the transaction</strong>.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_signature\">Wikipedia describes ring signatures as follow</a>: “<em>A ring signature is a type of </em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature\"><em>digital signature</em></a><em> that can be performed by any member of a group of users that each have keys. Therefore, a message signed with a ring signature is endorsed by someone in a particular group of people. One of the security properties of a ring signature is that it should be computationally infeasible to determine which of the group members’ keys was used to produce the signature.</em>”.</p><p>In RingCT’s case, the digital signature used to execute a transaction could have originated from any member of the <em>ring group</em>. Users put some of their funds within an Anon balance. Funds held within an Anon balance are used to execute RingCT transactions. Before a transaction is executed, the protocol anonymously signs it by <strong>using other RingCT outputs as</strong> <strong>decoys</strong> and produces a signature that, when verified, looks like it could have been initiated by any of the owners of the RingCT outputs used by the <em>ring group</em>. <strong>It is not possible to know who really made the transaction because it could be anyone that has an output that’s being used by the </strong><em><strong>ring group </strong></em><strong>as a decoy</strong>.</p><p><strong>This effectively anonymizes all values contained within a transaction</strong>— the amount transferred as well as both the transaction’s sender and receiver. It also arms transacting parties with a very strong <strong>plausible deniability</strong> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability\"><strong>1</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption\"><strong>2</strong></a>).</p><h3 id=\"how-to-make-an-anonymous-transaction-ringct-on-particl-desktop\">How to Make an Anonymous Transaction (RingCT) on Particl Desktop</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained---Private-Transactions/1-9xtnttI8YayVWxIaQVlBgw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>A RingCT transaction containing 24 ring members</figcaption></figure><p>On Particl Desktop, it is possible to pick the number of members you want to have within the <em>ring group</em> you’re going to use to anonymize your transactions. On the client, this is referred to as <em>NO. OF RING SIGS</em>.</p><p>What it means is simple, <strong>for every input used to generate your transaction, a number of other outputs will be used to create a digital signature that could have been signed by any of the 24 participants</strong>. In the screenshot just above, the value 24 is selected. This means 23 fake outputs, and 1 real one (the sender of the transaction) will be used to obfuscate the transaction (if it only has 1 input). If the transaction uses 3 inputs, it means 3 signatures, one for each input, with 3 different <em>ring groups </em>of 24 participants each,<em> </em>will be generated in order to execute the transactions. This may sound complicated, but don’t worry, Particl Desktop does everything for you and makes RingCT transactions as easy to send as any other type of transaction.</p><p><strong>To make a RingCT transaction</strong>, simply go into your Send/Convert tab, choose the Anontransaction type, click the Advanced Options, and use the PRIVACY LEVEL (NO. OF RING SIGS) slider that appears at the bottom left corner of the page. The value you pick will be equal to the number of <em>ring members</em> that will be part of your <em>ring group</em>. In reality, you can just leave the slider untouched and use the default level of privacy (8 <em>ring members</em>). This represents a good balance between privacy and cost.</p><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>The more inputs are consumed to execute a RingCT transaction, the more expensive it gets, but also the more private it is. Also, the more ring members (RING SIGS) is selected before executing a transaction, the more expensive it gets, but also the more private it is. If you don’t care about the cost of a transaction and just want maximum privacy, form transactions with as many ring members as possible and with as many inputs as possible.</blockquote><h3 id=\"keeping-a-good-level-of-privacy\">Keeping a Good Level of Privacy</h3><p>As a general rule of thumb and in theory, <strong>RingCT gets more private as more people convert their public balances into </strong>Anon<strong> balances</strong>, thus creating more <em>Anon</em> outputs to be used by <em>ring groups</em> for RingCT transactions. That’s because RingCT relies on other people’s outputs to plausibly deny which output actually signed a transaction, and <strong>the more RingCT outputs there are to sign transactions, the stronger the privacy and plausible deniability aspect of RingCT gets</strong>.</p><p>But, while outputs are randomly picked from any Anon outputs in the chain, they’re most often picked from the most recent RingCT transactions. The reason the protocol behaves this way is in response to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/\"><strong>this research paper</strong></a><strong> </strong>which demonstrates that real inputs can be guessed to be the most recent ones if all the “mixins” are much deeper in the chain and haven’t had transactions for a while.</p><p>For this reason, <strong>it is recommended that all users keep with them an </strong>Anon<strong> balance</strong> which can be automatically put to use by the network (at no fee to the users, of course). Additionally, <strong>it is also recommended that users transact as much as possible with </strong>Anon<strong> transactions</strong> so that it can contribute to enhancing the entire network’s privacy. Note that none of this is required in order to execute a RingCT transaction, but the more people do it, the stronger and more resilient it becomes for everyone.</p><p>This is also one of the main reason why Particl’s Open Marketplace is going to use RingCT transactions, by default, on all marketplace transactions. The best way to increase the RingCT pool is through transactional activity and actual usage of the technology, so making it default on what will become the platform’s main application is only logical and will go a long way into making Particl’s RingCT protocol a very solid one.</p><hr><h2 id=\"stealth-addresses\">Stealth Addresses</h2><p>Additionally, Particl allows anyone to use stealth addresses instead of regular, public addresses. Stealth addresses are one-time addresses that increase privacy because <strong>only the owner of a stealth address can tell if an output belongs to it or not</strong>. What is meant by “one-time address” is that a stealth address can receive payments many times, but each time, it generates a new ‘one-time address’ for that output/transaction.</p><p>Without knowing the private key of an address, an observer won’t be able to link and guess which outputs match which stealth address. <strong>This helps in protecting the identity of the receiver of a transaction.</strong></p><p>On their own, stealth addresses probably aren’t enough to protect transactions information from any well-funded and motivated observer (i.e. state actor), but when combined with stronger privacy protocols such as CT or RingCT, it provides yet another layer of privacy for the user.</p><p><strong>As it currently stands, blinded (CT) and anon (RingCT) transactions can only be executed to stealth addresses.</strong></p><hr><h2 id=\"ct-ringct-together-infinite-possibilities\">CT + RingCT Together = Infinite Possibilities</h2><p>Both privacy protocols have their own pros and cons, but one of the most notable differences between the two Particl implementations is the fact that CT has programmable outputs while RingCT does not. What that means is that RingCT, as is, simply cannot be used within smart-contracts. What that <strong>does not</strong> mean, however, is that it cannot be used within decentralized applications. How is that possible, if RingCT cannot be used in smart-contracts? <strong>This is one of the big reasons why Particl keeps both CT and RingCT protocols on its network instead of just one of them.</strong></p><p>In fact, because CT transactions have programmable outputs, they can be used in smart-contracts and then easily be linked to RingCT transactions. The benefit of Particl’s implementation is that the outputs can be spent from RingCT to CT for anything requiring a script, and then be sent back to RingCT.</p><p>The best example to illustrate this concept is with Particl’s Open Marketplace. It is a <strong>private-by-default marketplace that uses RingCT to completely anonymize marketplace transactions</strong>. What few people know is that the marketplace actually uses a combination of RingCT (the transaction) and CT (the smart-contract) for its escrow system, not RingCT.</p><p>That’s because the marketplace’s escrow system is based on smart-contract functionality, thus requiring transactions to have programmable outputs (hence why it uses CT). However, to interact with the smart-contract, users need to send a RingCT transaction to it, which the marketplace then automatically converts into a CT transaction for the duration of the escrow. Once it gets released by the two transacting parties, the transaction is finalized as a RingCT transaction.</p><blockquote>A RingCT output is converted to a CT output which in turn forms the inputs of the escrow contract. When the escrow is ready to be released or refunded, it will directly be released to a RingCT output.— <a href=\"https://github.com/kewde/\"><strong>Kewde</strong></a><strong>, Particl Developer and </strong><a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/\"><strong>OMP Library</strong></a><strong> Author</strong></blockquote><p>This is just one example of how RingCT can be given its full potential and leverage the Particl and Bitcoin ecosystems using its CT counterpart. The same sort of technique can be applied to integrate RingCT into other protocols or services such as atomic swaps, the Lightning Network, other decentralized applications, and etc.</p><hr><p>If you liked this article, share it wide and beyond and stay tuned as more <em>Particl Explained </em>articles will be posted on <a href=\"http://particl.news\"><strong>particl.news</strong></a> in the future.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained---Private-Transactions/1-wZwosKBtAh5-VPGJZgliQg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p><strong>The Particl team</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

Testnet fork scheduled for 2019.07.01–12:00:00 UTC\n * Enable variable difficulty for smsg free messages.\n\nSMSG variable difficulty gives the network a way to disable free smsg messages\nif someone starts spamming. By design, each free smsg has to hash in a certain\nway (like PoW). This makes the difficulty variable as opposed to hard-coded.\n\n? Mainnet fork scheduled for 2019.07.16–12:00:00 UTC\n * Enable bulletproof rangeproofs.\n * Enable RingCT transactions.\n * Enable variable fee rate for smsg paid messages.\n * Enable variable difficulty for smsg free messages.\n\nBulletproof rangeproofs are a much more efficient rangeproof than what has been\non the network to date. When we launched Particl with Confidential Transactions\n(CT) in 2017 a major difficulty was the size of blind transactions compared to \npublic transactions. CT transactions typically are 20x larger than non-CT\ntransactions. Bulletproofs can allow doubling the range size while still\nreducing transactions sizes by 65% or more.\n\n> Bulletproofs are much more general than rangeproofs. They can be used to prove,\nin zero knowledge, arbitrary statements. They are equivalent in power to SNARKs\n[https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/507] or STARKs [https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/046],\nbut have native support for elliptic curve (EC) public keys and Pedersen\ncommitments (so there is typically no need to implement EC math inside a program\nbeing proven). Also, unlike SNARKs, Bulletproofs have full 128-bit security\nunder standard assumptions with no trusted setup. Unlike STARKs, they are fast\nenough to prove and verify reasonably-sized problems on typical computing\nhardware. —Andrew Poelstra\n[https://blockstream.com/2018/02/21/en-bulletproofs-faster-rangeproofs-and-much-more/]\nRingCT transactions are unlinkable and untraceable onchain transactions. RingCT\nis short for Ring Confidential Transactions. First described\n[https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf] by Shen Noether of XMR Labs, Particl’s\nversion is a complete ground-up build on the current Bitcoin codebase (0.18) by\nour very talented Lead Core developer Tecnovert.\n\n> For the record, this whole development update is directly tied to the phenomenal\nwork Tecnovert builds into Particl Core. Give him a big “Thank You!” next time\nyou stop in our Discord [https://discord.me/particl] | Open Development Channel.\nThe announcement of RingCT coming to the main chain is huge news for a number of\nyou waiting for fully anonymous PART transactions. Tecnovert first released\nRingCT onto the test chain in the middle of 2017 and we have had a number of\nrespected researchers, educators and code auditors review it over the last 2\nyears.\n\nThe last security audit preformed by Quarkslab has been sent to the team and\nreviewed. We will have more news about it when they publish the public audit. We\nchose to engage Quarkslab on our MLSAG/bulletproof algorithms because of their\nprevious work with identifying 4 major/3 minor vulnerabilities in Monero’s\nbulletproof security audit\n[https://blog.quarkslab.com/security-audit-of-monero-bulletproofs.html].\n\nCold Staking Pool Operators\nTecnovert has raised the daemon version for the coldstakingpool code to\n0.18.0.10.\n\nA new version page is available here: \nhttps://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool/blob/master/doc/upgrade_daemon.txt\n\nDon’t Forget!\n?

With this, the Awareness Campaign is now resumed\n[https://friends.particl.community], with sign up payouts disabled, so that you\ncan continue earning staking shares by referring your friends to Particl. When\nyou reach 12 points, you will earn your first staking share. Each additional\npoint will reward you with a staking share.\n\nFor more details, read our latest blog post on the Awareness Campaign by\nfollowing this link: \nhttps://particl.news/particl-awareness-campaign-update-d94347324121\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe announced a few days before the NYC Blockchain Week that we were launching an\nawareness campaign to get more people to know about Particl. While we expected\nthe campaign to reach a few hundred people, it blew up and went viral overnight,\nreaching the hidden payouts cap that had been set up for the campaign in just a\nfew hours.\n\nWith the first payouts being initially scheduled for today, we’d like to thank\neverybody that has participated in the campaign so for and keep you updated on\nthe status of the campaign and let you know what comes next!\n\nThe Campaign Goes Viral\nThis awareness campaign was initially designed to be a grassroots initiative to\nget friends to know about Particl and its Open Marketplace. Little did we know,\nthe campaign became viral in a matter of mere hours and was shared within many\nmassive airdrop and signup groups, creating a rapid influx of participants\novernight.\n\nAwareness Campaign Stats\n * Number of registered participants: 16,944\n * Number of participants automatically detected as fraudulent: 6,657\n * Number of Particl Desktop downloads during campaign: ~2,000\n * Hidden payouts cap reached after: ~16 hours\n * Number of participants that qualify for staking shares: 105\n\nCircumventing Fraud\nBecause we did not expect this campaign to get as viral as it did, and so\nrapidly, we’ve been surprised by the huge amount of fraudulent participation\nwe’ve received. Luckily, the platform we’re using to run the campaign was set up\nto automatically flag fraudulent emails based on various criteria. In total, the\nsystem flagged 6,657 fake emails based on a wide variety of criteria, excluding\nthese participants from the campaign.\n\nAdditionally, we’ve been running our own script to find any other fraudulent\nemail that would bypass the platform’s filter. In the end, it turns out that \nonly ~1,800 participants have properly followed all the steps required by the\ncampaign, a figure that matches closely the approximate number of unique Particl\nDesktop downloads.\n\nCampaign Status\nThe fraud attempts have required more time to sort out than expected. We also\nwanted to take off as many fake participants as possible in order to keep the\ncontest fair for the honest participants.\n\nTo make that process easier, we temporarily paused the campaign until we could\nbuild scripts that would be able to automatically filter large amounts of emails\nand private addresses and get them sorted on a database so that we could process\npayouts more effectively.\n\nAs such, we still need a bit of time before processing payment, a process that\nwill probably extend over the next few days.\n\nWhen Will I Receive my Payout?\nIf you qualify for the signup payouts, don’t worry, it is normal that you\nhaven’t received anything yet. You should be receiving your payment within the\nnext few hours/days. You won’t need to do anything special to claim your PART,\nit will simply eventually show up on your Overview page as an incoming\ntransaction!\n\nAs a reminder, here are the criteria to qualify for payouts:\n\n * Sign up on https://friends.particl.community/\n * Verify your email after signing up\n * Send your stealth address to friends@particl.io\n * Complete the steps above before the hidden payout cap is reached (within the\n   first 16 hours of the campaign)\n\nIf you also qualify for staking shares, meaning that you at least got 10 of your\nfriends to sign up with Particl, you should also receive your first payment\nshortly.\n\nAs a reminder, here are the criteria to qualify for staking shares:\n\n * Sign up on https://friends.particl.community/\n * Verify your email after signing up\n * Send your stealth address to friends@particl.io\n * Get more than 10 friends to sign up with Particl\n\nWhat We’ve Learned From this Campaign\nThis campaign has had good results — Particl Desktop has been downloaded around\n2,000 times during this campaign. After all, the goal was to get users playing\naround with crypto’s best-looking wallet!\n\nBut it is also very clear that the system has been abused to a bigger extent\nthan we expected it to be. Nearly 17,000 people participated, but there were\nonly around 2,000 unique downloads of Particl Desktop and around 1,800\nparticipants that went through the campaign’s steps properly. That means that,\nright out of the bat, around 15,000 (~88%) participants haven’t properly gone\nthrough the process of qualifying for payouts.\n\nThis has been a good experiment that has brought valuable insight as to how to\nimprove future awareness campaigns and how to sustain larger degrees of\nparticipation. We look forward to initiating similar campaigns in the future by\nusing the goods, without the bads, of this awareness campaign.\n\nWhat Now?\nOnce the first payouts will be paid, we will resume the Awareness Campaign as\nplanned. Remember, now that the hidden payouts cap has been reached after only\n16 hours into the campaign, the only reward for signing up with Particl will be\nthe staking shares earned once you get more than 10 of your friends to sign up\nas well.\n\nKeep your eyes close to your Particl Desktop wallet. Once you receive your\npayment, the Awareness Campaign will resume and you’ll be able to start earning\npoints again by getting your friends to sign up on \nhttps://friends.particl.community/.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe would like to thank everyone that has participated in the campaign so far and\nwish you the best luck in your hunt for staking shares!\n\nIf you have any question regarding the Awareness Campaign, join our Particl\nAwareness Telegram channel by following this link: https://t.me/particlawareness\n.\n\nTo read the announcement post for the campaign, follow this link: \nhttps://particl.news/announcement-particl-awareness-campaign-464baa8477b5\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Particl Team","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Awareness-Campaign-Update/1-0aizM4VoRA47jkDdp0fdDA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><hr><p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>The sign up payouts for the Awareness Campaign have been executed earlier today.

simply\nfollow the links below:\n\n * Project Recap [https://particl.news/community-update-13-part-1-bd721e7b9917]\n * NYC Blockchain Week Recap\n   [https://particl.news/community-update-13-part-2-f4ca972abed0]\n\nParticl Open Marketplace Mainnet Release Timeline\nSince Particl has updated its core to 0.18 just 13 days ago\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.7], we would like\nto let you know exactly where we currently stand, what’s the current projected\nmainnet release timeline, and what to look out for in the next few days!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOpen Marketplace Mainnet Release Roadmap\n * (1) Finish blind escrow integration (Done)\n * (2) Finish the OMP Library integration tests (In progress)\n * (3) Tweak Particl Desktop to integrate the OMP Library (Pending) -> ETA: 1–2\n   days\n * (4) Publish final testnet build to the community before mainnet release \n   (Pending) -> ETA: Approximately 1 week if all goes smoothly\n * (5) Mainnet release of the Open Marketplace (Pending)\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinish the Blind Escrow Integration (Done)\nDuring the last few weeks, the team had the opportunity to integrate the blind\nescrow in full and make a series of critical tweaks to the OMP Library just\nbefore releasing the marketplace on mainnet. The OMP Library was written some\ntime ago by Particl’s developer Kewde, but the team wanted to make some\nmodifications to it and run proper testing, specifically related to the buy\nflow, before putting it onto mainnet.\n\nThe OMP Library is a major improvement to the backend of the Particl Open\nMarketplace, allowing for example escrows to process transactions automatically\nusing Confidential Transactions or for listings to have more attributes.\n\nWe are happy to say that the integration of the blind escrow system into the\nmarketplace is now complete.\n\nFinish the OMP Library Integration Tests (In Progress)\nThe next step is to finalize the OMP Library integration by running the whole\nsuite of automated tests the team has built over the last two years. These\nautomated tests are designed to stress test any new feature and try to break\nthem in any possible way.\n\nWhen a test fails, it highlights precisely what the problems are that need to be\nupdated, adjusted or changed. Once issues are fixed, the test is ran again until\nit finds another issue. Because of the unpredictability of the testing results,\nwe would rather not give an estimate today but rather wait a few days until\nafter these tests are complete.\n\nWe initially intended to finish those tests before flying out to the NYC\nBlockchain Week and then run the final testnet build while we were at the\nconferences. However, we fell short by a few days before Juha, Particl’s Lead\nMarketplace Developer, joined the team in New York City to present the Open\nMarketplace. This has unfortunately caused a few days of delay and is the reason\nwhy we are still finalizing the tests to this day. He has now safely made it\nback home and has resumed the last few tests before we put out what will be the\nfinal testnet build before the first mainnet release.\n\nNote that running these tests is not a very challenging or difficult process. To\nthe contrary, this is quite a redundant task, but it requires time. While a\nmajority of the tests has been completed successfully, it is difficult to give a\nclear estimate of how long it will take to complete the remaining ones. We\nactually expect this process to be over pretty quickly now, and we will\ncommunicate a more definitive timeline as soon as these tests are done.\n\nWhy are These Tests so Important?\nThese automated tests are extremely important, and they are part of what makes\nParticl stand out from the crowd as a super secure network. Every feature we put\nout in the wild is tested against a variety of automated tests to ensure that it\nis as secure and stable as we can possibly make it.\n\nThe tests are especially important when it comes to core marketplace components.\nIn fact, there’s a reason why everything has to be perfect when it gets moved\nonto mainnet, especially when it comes to the buy flow and escrow of the\nmarketplace.\n\nIn fact, once the marketplace goes out on mainnet, we have to assume that there\nwill always be acts of commerce, even if it’s not publicly visible. That puts a\nhuge amount of limitations on what can be updated if we want to ensure the\nsecurity of our users’ funds. Imagine rebuilding a motor in a race car…while\nit’s on the track racing.\n\nTake the escrow system as an example. If the network pushes a big update on the\nseller side while there are some ongoing marketplace transactions with funds\nlocked in escrow, then the escrow would encounter new (unexpected) code that\ncould potentially cause critical bugs where funds could be lost. As you can\nimagine, a test network is much more forgiving of bugs than a mainnet\nenvironment!\n\n> Imagine rebuilding a motor in a race car while it’s on the track\nracing. — Joe Fisher\nThat doesn’t mean the Open Marketplace cannot have its components updated after\nit launches. It just means that coding new changes will be much more time\nconsuming as we need to make sure new and old codes can recognize each other and\nare fully compatible. That alone, as you can expect, would require a lot of\ntesting before unleashing on mainnet.\n\nThis is precisely why we have such a perfectionist approach to the mainnet\nrelease.\n\nIntegrate the OMP Library into Particl Desktop (Pending)\nOnce the tests are done, Particl Desktop will need to be tweaked to integrate\nthe last few changes. This step of the process is actually much easier and quick\nto complete than it sounds. As some aspects of the OMP Library change how the\nbackend works, Particl Desktop has to be tweaked so that the integration works\nflawlessly. Don’t worry, this should take only 1 or 2 days at most for the\nintegration to be worked in as there hasn’t been any modification made to\nParticl Desktop since our last testnet except for the few changes to the buy\nflow caused by the integration of the OMP Library.\n\nLast Testnet Build Before Mainnet (Pending)\nAs soon as the Particl Desktop tweaks are done, we will be packaging, for the\ncommunity, what will be the final testnet build before the first mainnet release\nof the Particl Open Marketplace!\n\nBecause the marketplace has already been thoroughly tested during the last few\nmonths, we do not expect any major issue to be identified. What will be the\nimportant thing to test here will be the buy flow and the blind escrow, but as\nthey will already have went through a ton of automated tests prior to being\nreleased on testnet, it is likely that no issue arises.\n\nNevertheless, we want as many testers as possible to test this final testnet\nclient before the first-ever mainnet build. This is the reason why we will be\nrunning a short bug hunting contest where we’ll be giving away a total of $500\nworth of PART to the best bug hunters out there! We will reveal all of the\ndetails once we publish the testnet build.\n\nWe estimate that, if all goes smoothly, this testnet build will run for a\nduration of approximately 1 week. Keep in mind this isn’t a deadline or a hard\ndate, but an estimation of how long we’d like to keep it running if no major\nissue arises.\n\nThen, once that is all said and done, the time to get the Open Marketplace live\non mainnet will be upon us!\n\nMainnet Release of the Open Marketplace (Pending)\nThis is the moment we’ve all been waiting for — the mainnet release of the Open\nMarketplace. This milestone event will see the marketplace make its way onto\nmainnet and be able to be used to buy and sell real products and services, with\nreal funds. This big moment will follow right after we complete the last testnet\nrun of the Open Marketplace before it goes on mainnet for the first time.\n\nSo When is it Coming Out on Mainnet, Exactly?\nAt this very moment, we still cannot commit to a fixed date due to the fact that\nthe tests are still running. The automated tests are expected to be completed\nwithin a pretty short time frame of a few days, though. Then, once it’s done, 1\nto 2 days will need to be allocated to tweak Particl Desktop and then the last\ntestnet will be released to the public for a period of approximately 1 week, if\nall goes smoothly. We definitely want and will communicate a more precise\ntimeline for the mainnet release as soon as we complete the OMP Library\nintegration tests. However, this development update should still be able to give\nyou a rough estimate of the timeline we’re currently looking into.\n\nIn the meantime, we are following up on our leads and connections we’ve made at\nthe Magical Crypto Conference and Consensus in order to maximize the exposure of\nthe mainnet release of the Particl Open Marketplace and adjust our strategy in\nlight of the new contacts we’ve made.\n\nAfter nearly two years of intensive development, we are nearly there! All\nfeatures intended to be part of the first mainnet version of the marketplace\nhave been integrated and are going through their final automated testing rounds.\nAlthough we are not able to give a definitive date for the mainnet release\ntoday, we will be communicating one very shortly.\n\nHang tight because from here on out, things will get very interesting!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews Flash: Particl Bulletproofs Audit by Quarkslab\nOn a non-marketplace related note, we are pleased to announce that Quarkslab\n[https://www.quarkslab.com/en/] has started auditing our Bitcoin-based\nBulletproofs integration. Quarkslab is a world-renowned security firm having\naudited codes and projects like OpenSSL\n[https://ostif.org/the-ostif-and-quarkslab-audit-of-openssl-is-complete/], \nVeraCrypt\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/veracrypt-audit-multiple-critical-vulnerabilities,32878.html]\n, OpenVPN [https://blog.quarkslab.com/security-assessment-of-openvpn.html], and,\ninterestingly enough, Monero’s Bulletproofs implementation\n[https://blokt.com/news/monero-fixes-all-bulletproof-protocol-vulnerabilities-found-in-second-security-audit]\n.\n\nOnce the audit is done, we’ll look into the report, address any potential issue\nit identifies, and start planning ahead for a hardfork of Particl’s RingCT with\nBulletproofs on mainnet.\n\nWe will keep you informed as details come in!\n\nWelcome — Quarkslab [https://www.quarkslab.com/en/]\nEvery security issue is different, every solution must be\n[https://www.quarkslab.com/en/]www.quarkslab.com [https://www.quarkslab.com/en/]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Coming up?\nWith all the intended features for the first mainnet version of the marketplace\nbeing integrated, part of the development team has now started working on the\nnext features that will be integrated into the marketplace. Note that none of\nthese new features will be included in the first mainnet version of the Open\nMarketplace. As the build is pretty stable right now, we do not want to\nintegrate new functions that could delay the mainnet release.\n\nQuantity Management\nA must-have for vendors running a business out of their sales. Quantity\nManagement is like a lite version of the full Inventory Management system we\nplan on integrating later during the Beta phase of development. It allows\nvendors to set quantities for their listings and lets people bid multiple times\non the same listings if the vendors set their quantity accordingly.\n\nFuture Features\nThe Particl team also has other features it would like to focus on first after\nthe mainnet release of the Open Marketplace. We still want to go through a few\nother development meeting sessions before communicating what other features\nother than Quantity Management will be worked on first. We will let you know all\nof the information after the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis concludes the Development Update part of this Community Update.

This has unfortunately caused a few days of delay and is the reason why we are still finalizing the tests to this day. He has now safely made it back home and has resumed the last few tests before we put out what will be the final testnet build before the first mainnet release.</p><p>Note that running these tests is not a very challenging or difficult process.

Every feature we put out in the wild is tested against a variety of automated tests to ensure that it is as secure and stable as we can possibly make it.</p><p>The tests are especially important when it comes to core marketplace components. In fact, there’s a reason why everything has to be perfect when it gets moved onto mainnet, especially when it comes to the buy flow and escrow of the marketplace.</p><p>In fact, once the marketplace goes out on mainnet, we have to assume that there will always be acts of commerce, even if it’s not publicly visible. That puts a huge amount of limitations on what can be updated if we want to ensure the security of our users’ funds. Imagine rebuilding a motor in a race car…while it’s on the track racing.</p><p>Take the escrow system as an example. If the network pushes a big update on the seller side while there are some ongoing marketplace transactions with funds locked in escrow, then the escrow would encounter new (unexpected) code that could potentially cause critical bugs where funds could be lost. As you can imagine, a test network is much more forgiving of bugs than a mainnet environment!</p><blockquote>Imagine rebuilding a motor in a race car while it’s on the track racing. — Joe Fisher</blockquote><p>That doesn’t mean the Open Marketplace cannot have its components updated after it launches. It just means that coding new changes will be much more time consuming as we need to make sure new and old codes can recognize each other and are fully compatible. That alone, as you can expect, would require a lot of testing before unleashing on mainnet.</p><p>This is precisely why we have such a perfectionist approach to the mainnet release.</p><h3 id=\"integrate-the-omp-library-into-particl-desktop-pending-\">Integrate the OMP Library into Particl Desktop (Pending)</h3><p>Once the tests are done, Particl Desktop will need to be tweaked to integrate the last few changes. This step of the process is actually much easier and quick to complete than it sounds. As some aspects of the OMP Library change how the backend works, Particl Desktop has to be tweaked so that the integration works flawlessly. Don’t worry, this should take only 1 or 2 days at most for the integration to be worked in as there hasn’t been any modification made to Particl Desktop since our last testnet except for the few changes to the buy flow caused by the integration of the OMP Library.</p><h3 id=\"last-testnet-build-before-mainnet-pending-\">Last Testnet Build Before Mainnet (Pending)</h3><p>As soon as the Particl Desktop tweaks are done, we will be packaging, for the community, what will be the final testnet build before the first mainnet release of the Particl Open Marketplace!</p><p>Because the marketplace has already been thoroughly tested during the last few months, we do not expect any major issue to be identified. What will be the important thing to test here will be the buy flow and the blind escrow, but as they will already have went through a ton of automated tests prior to being released on testnet, it is likely that no issue arises.</p><p>Nevertheless, we want as many testers as possible to test this final testnet client before the first-ever mainnet build. This is the reason why we will be running a <strong>short bug hunting contest where we’ll be giving away a total of $500 worth of PART to the best bug hunters out there</strong>! We will reveal all of the details once we publish the testnet build.</p><p>We estimate that, if all goes smoothly, this testnet build will run for a duration of approximately 1 week. Keep in mind this isn’t a deadline or a hard date, but an estimation of how long we’d like to keep it running if no major issue arises.</p><p>Then, once that is all said and done, the time to get the Open Marketplace live on mainnet will be upon us!</p><h3 id=\"mainnet-release-of-the-open-marketplace-pending-\">Mainnet Release of the Open Marketplace (Pending)</h3><p>This is the moment we’ve all been waiting for — the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace. This milestone event will see the marketplace make its way onto mainnet and be able to be used to buy and sell real products and services, with real funds.

Week\nLast week, the Particl team met in New York City to participate in the NYC\nBlockchain Week\n[https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2019/blockchain-week/events] by\nhaving a booth at both the Magical Crypto Conference and Consensus. There, the\nteam demonstrated the long-awaited Particl Open Marketplace, on mainnet, for the\nfirst time ever and was able to make a huge leap forward by connecting directly\nwith the crypto community.\n\nToward the Particl Open Marketplace\n[https://particl.news/toward-the-particl-open-marketplace-262ab7142921]\nThe coming week is shaping up to be a very exciting one. Many Particl team\nmembers are gathering in New York City for…\n[https://particl.news/toward-the-particl-open-marketplace-262ab7142921]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/toward-the-particl-open-marketplace-262ab7142921]\n\nIf you would like to read about Part 1 and Part 3 of this Community Update, then\nfollow the links below:\n\n * Project Recap [https://particl.news/community-update-13-part-1-bd721e7b9917]\n * Development Update\n   [https://particl.news/community-update-13-part-3-4d53bcf621af]\n\nMagical Crypto Conference\nThe team’s first stop was at the Magical Crypto Conference\n[https://www.magicalcryptoconference.com/], an event organized by the “magical\nfriends” — Charlie Lee, Samson Mow, Ricardo Spagni, and WhalePanda. In\ncomparison to Consensus, MCC aims to be the go-to conference for the true crypto\nfans and cypherpunks. It is an environment that is safe from all the corporate\ninfluence of Consensus and focuses on the tech moving forward. And magical it\nwas…\n\nDay 1 of MCC was Particl’s cupcake day. In fact, Particl saw its first\nsuccessful marketplace transaction take place on mainnet\n[https://twitter.com/LiteBitCo/status/1127237342920675328]! This is an enormous\nmilestone for the project and it really started the week on the right foot,\nespecially as the whole process happened very smoothly and without any hiccup.\n\nBecause this event was mostly attended by long-time Bitcoin fans and people who\ngenerally don’t like the whole corporate/altcoin aspect of Consensus, we\nexpected to be met with skepticism and be put on the spot. However, we were\npleasantly surprised that we received almost no pushback and that the Particl\nOpen Marketplace was well appreciated by almost everyone that stopped at the\nbooth.\n\nMax Keiser at the Particl boothUsually, most people don’t like when a platform\nis exclusive to its native coin. That’s why getting other payment options has\nproven to be something people really like about Particl. Yes, Particl has its\nnative coin that needs to be used so that all transaction details remain\nprivate, but you will still be able to make payments in Bitcoin if you want to.\nThe ability to integrate other payment options really makes Particl a platform\nintended to be used by all crypto users.\n\nOne of our goal at MCC was to get as much feedback, information, and interest\nfrom the very type of people that attended the event: crypto fans. After all,\nthe first few mainnet versions of the Open Marketplace will be targeting crypto\nusers, and what better place to connect with our target audience than MCC.\n\nWe can definitely say that we’ve reached our goal at MCC. We’ve met vendors,\ndevelopers, influencers in the space, media people, and a variety of hardcore\ncrypto fans that want to use crypto as a currencies. We’ve gathered invaluable\nfeedback from the very people we’re building this platform for, and we’ve got to\nshowcase the Open Marketplace in front of a pretty receptive crowd. Magical\nCrypto Conference most definitely did help with booths-on-the-ground exposure\nand is an event we are definitely looking forward to participating again!\n\nConsensus\nWhereas Magical Crypto Conference was more about getting potential users to know\nabout the Open Marketplace, Consensus\n[https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2019] meant business!\n\nAs you might already know, this year’s edition of Consensus was a pretty\nexpensive conference to attend to, a single ticket being priced at a whopping\n$1,999! On top of that, the long crypto winter has been rough on many people,\nmaking the purchase of such a high-priced ticket a more difficult decision. This\nactually turned out to be a good thing.\n\nLike many people who attended last year’s edition of Consensus mentioned, the\nprevious edition was pretty chaotic, filled with ICO pitches and people chasing\naround for quick bucks. Most people came back from last year’s Consensus with a\nsour taste in their mouth, which is actually one of the main reason why Magical\nCrypto Conference was created in the first place.\n\nSmaller but Better Crowd\nThis year’s edition of Consensus attracted fewer people than last year. The\nquality of the attendees, however, was much better. It brought together experts\nand figures from almost all global industries as they blended in with crypto\nfans. There were media, government officials, big corporation representatives,\nmany team members from other crypto projects, developers, and etc. This all\nresulted in a crowd eagerly looking into and trying to figure out how blockchain\nsolutions could disrupt their respective industries.\n\nAnd as it turns out, Consensus ended being an eye opener for the Particl team.\nIt has been a great opportunity to meet and spend quality time with major\nvendors (B2B or B2C), suppliers, and businesses that were in dire need for a\ntrustless escrow system that is also free of use and private by design. In fact,\nwe have met so many people that were simply mindblown by the potential of\nParticl’s MAD decentralized escrow and how it could dramatically improve their\nbusinesses, and we’ve got to discuss many different use cases and scenarios with\nthem.\n\nDisrupting of Supply Chains\nParticl has always been portrayed as an empowering solution for retail buyers\nand vendors — a sort of “decentralized eBay or Amazon”, if you will. But what\nsome of the people we’ve met at Consensus have made it very clear to us is that\nthe Open Marketplace, especially with its free-of-use MAD decentralized escrow\nsystem, has the potential to disrupt not only retail eCommerce, but also how\nsupply chains operate in a major way.\n\nThe Particl technology enables suppliers to optimize their supply chains by\ngetting rid of intermediaries and significantly reducing the cost of securely\nmoving supply around. The privacy aspect of it can allow for various\napplications such as product/supply arbitrage, hiding manufacturing supply\nchains, hiding R&D production methods, act as a private OTC market for trading\ngoods, services, crypto or securities, and etc.\n\nFrom all the types of people we’ve met, suppliers and high volume vendors seemed\nto be the ones that were the most impressed by the disruptive potential of the\nOpen Marketplace and that needed it the most. Particl allows them to entirely\navoid most of the challenges they face every day, which is completely\ngroundbreaking for them and will tremendously improve their businesses.\n\nSeeing just how badly suppliers are having it was really insightful and is one\nof the huge takeaway we’ve had from Consensus.\n\nGreat Connections\nAside from suppliers, we’ve met a ton other interesting people with whom we’ve\nhad quality time — media, exchanges, blockchain projects, influencers in the\nspace, and etc. The fact that fewer people attended the event this year made it\nless chaotic and easier to get into longer and higher quality conversations.\n\nWe are extremely satisfied with the connections we’ve made at Consensus, and\nwe’re now working on following those leads and walking through the many doors\nthat have been opening up to the project since the NYC Blockchain Week started.\n\nInsights Right From the Trenches\nNot only have we made a great number of key connections, but all of those\ndiscussions have also been extremely insightful to the team. The fact that so\nmany people came with so many different backgrounds and areas of expertise, it\ngave us a lot of different perspectives and ways to see how Particl’s Open\nMarketplace could be used in real-life situations. Suffice to say, the potential\nof this marketplace extends much further than just being a cool marketplace for\ncrypto users.\n\nNYC Blockchain Week Recap\nThe NYC Blockchain Week may very well turn out to be a very impactful event for\nParticl. The Particl team is coming back home with a strong sense of mission\naccomplished. We’ve had the opportunity to meet with so many of the users we’re\nbuilding this platform for, collect a vast amount of feedback from them and get\ndecent exposure in the heart of crypto.\n\nThe whole team that attended the conferences feels like this entire week has\nbeen a solid validation of what we’ve known all along — Particl is a highly\ndisruptive marketplace that looks and feels right. The only difference now is\nthat we’ve met some of the very people that need this marketplace the most, and\nwe are all as motivated and optimistic about the future of this project as we’ve\never been!\n\nA Rare Working Blockchain Product\nOnce again, just like the few recent conferences we’ve attended, Particl seemed\nto be among the minority of booths with a working product on display. This was\nsomething that impressed a lot of people.\n\nSometimes, the booth would be so busy that you would need to explain Particl a\nbit further away from the computers. Then, when the person would ask for a video\ndemo, they’d be completely surprised to learn that we actually had a working\nversion of it on mainnet just a few meters away. This was a reaction we’ve seen\ntime and time again, people are still not used to the fact that a blockchain\nproduct could be live on mainnet, and look so damn good.\n\nBest Testing Ground\nOne very interesting aspect of our week in NYC was the fact that for the entire\nduration of the two conferences we’ve attended, the Particl Open Marketplace has\nbeen thoroughly tested on mainnet and under many different circumstances. We\nhave observed no issue whatsoever, and we feel very confident moving forward\nwith this product.\n\nWhat Now?\nWe want to continue traveling the world and keep reaching out to more people.\nWe’ve also made great friendships and connections with people in the space with\nwhom we want to keep spending time with. This is the reason why we’ll actively\nbe looking around at other conferences and keep an eye out for any interesting\nevent.\n\nAs such, we likely will have a few team members going to San Francisco on the\n25th and 26th of June for the Bitcoin2019 conference\n[https://www.bitcoin2019conference.com/]. We will announce more details shortly,\nbut if you are planning on going as well, definitely drop us a message and let’s\ntry to meet up at the conference!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis concludes the NYC Blockchain Week Recap part of this Community Update.

There, the team demonstrated the long-awaited Particl Open Marketplace, on mainnet, for the first time ever and was able to make a huge leap forward by connecting directly with the crypto community.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/toward-the-particl-open-marketplace-262ab7142921\"><strong>Toward the Particl Open Marketplace</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/toward-the-particl-open-marketplace-262ab7142921\"><em>The coming week is shaping up to be a very exciting one.

However, we were pleasantly surprised that we received almost no pushback and that the Particl Open Marketplace was well appreciated by almost everyone that stopped at the booth.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--13---Part-2/1-EfxiVhuXxFqWGObfPo_PWA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Max Keiser at the Particl booth</figcaption></figure><p>Usually, most people don’t like when a platform is exclusive to its native coin. That’s why getting other payment options has proven to be something people really like about Particl. Yes, Particl has its native coin that needs to be used so that all transaction details remain private, but you will still be able to make payments in Bitcoin if you want to. The ability to integrate other payment options really makes Particl a platform intended to be used by all crypto users.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--13---Part-2/1-Pav2psmSB0_-bZa0z8pRQw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>One of our goal at MCC was to get as much feedback, information, and interest from the very type of people that attended the event: crypto fans. After all, the first few mainnet versions of the Open Marketplace will be targeting crypto users, and what better place to connect with our target audience than MCC.</p><p>We can definitely say that we’ve reached our goal at MCC. We’ve met vendors, developers, influencers in the space, media people, and a variety of hardcore crypto fans that want to use crypto as a currencies. We’ve gathered invaluable feedback from the very people we’re building this platform for, and we’ve got to showcase the Open Marketplace in front of a pretty receptive crowd. Magical Crypto Conference most definitely did help with booths-on-the-ground exposure and is an event we are definitely looking forward to participating again!</p><h2 id=\"consensus\">Consensus</h2><p>Whereas Magical Crypto Conference was more about getting potential users to know about the Open Marketplace, <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2019\"><strong>Consensus</strong></a> meant business!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--13---Part-2/1-nARXbCJNMcUjiJmrCPgKWQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>As you might already know, this year’s edition of Consensus was a pretty expensive conference to attend to, a single ticket being priced at a whopping $1,999! On top of that, the long crypto winter has been rough on many people, making the purchase of such a high-priced ticket a more difficult decision. This actually turned out to be a good thing.</p><p>Like many people who attended last year’s edition of Consensus mentioned, the previous edition was pretty chaotic, filled with ICO pitches and people chasing around for quick bucks. Most people came back from last year’s Consensus with a sour taste in their mouth, which is actually one of the main reason why Magical Crypto Conference was created in the first place.</p><h3 id=\"smaller-but-better-crowd\">Smaller but Better Crowd</h3><p>This year’s edition of Consensus attracted fewer people than last year. The quality of the attendees, however, was much better. It brought together experts and figures from almost all global industries as they blended in with crypto fans. There were media, government officials, big corporation representatives, many team members from other crypto projects, developers, and etc. This all resulted in a crowd eagerly looking into and trying to figure out how blockchain solutions could disrupt their respective industries.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--13---Part-2/1-voIPMRhL2RfDNElVliA1gg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>And as it turns out, Consensus ended being an eye opener for the Particl team. It has been a great opportunity to meet and spend quality time with major vendors (B2B or B2C), suppliers, and businesses that were in dire need for a trustless escrow system that is also free of use and private by design. In fact, we have met so many people that were simply mindblown by the potential of Particl’s MAD decentralized escrow and how it could dramatically improve their businesses, and we’ve got to discuss many different use cases and scenarios with them.</p><h3 id=\"disrupting-of-supply-chains\">Disrupting of Supply Chains</h3><p>Particl has always been portrayed as an empowering solution for retail buyers and vendors — a sort of “decentralized eBay or Amazon”, if you will. But what some of the people we’ve met at Consensus have made it very clear to us is that the Open Marketplace, especially with its free-of-use MAD decentralized escrow system, has the potential to disrupt not only retail eCommerce, but also how supply chains operate in a major way.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--13---Part-2/1-I9y28fq0kQ51wJolPi9_SQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>The Particl technology enables suppliers to optimize their supply chains by getting rid of intermediaries and significantly reducing the cost of securely moving supply around. The privacy aspect of it can allow for various applications such as product/supply arbitrage, hiding manufacturing supply chains, hiding R&#x26;D production methods, act as a private OTC market for trading goods, services, crypto or securities, and etc.</p><p>From all the types of people we’ve met, suppliers and high volume vendors seemed to be the ones that were the most impressed by the disruptive potential of the Open Marketplace and that needed it the most. Particl allows them to entirely avoid most of the challenges they face every day, which is completely groundbreaking for them and will tremendously improve their businesses.</p><p>Seeing just how badly suppliers are having it was really insightful and is one of the huge takeaway we’ve had from Consensus.</p><h3 id=\"great-connections\">Great Connections</h3><p>Aside from suppliers, we’ve met a ton other interesting people with whom we’ve had quality time — media, exchanges, blockchain projects, influencers in the space, and etc. The fact that fewer people attended the event this year made it less chaotic and easier to get into longer and higher quality conversations.</p><p>We are extremely satisfied with the connections we’ve made at Consensus, and we’re now working on following those leads and walking through the many doors that have been opening up to the project since the NYC Blockchain Week started.</p><h3 id=\"insights-right-from-the-trenches\">Insights Right From the Trenches</h3><p>Not only have we made a great number of key connections, but all of those discussions have also been extremely insightful to the team.
