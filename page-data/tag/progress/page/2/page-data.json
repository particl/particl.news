taken the time to\nenjoy the holidays as much as possible and that you're well rested. ?\n\nOn our end, progress never stops, even during holidays, and we'd like to take a\nmoment to look back at what we've achieved in the past few days and see what\nwe've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nDogecoin Integration ?\nWe are still in the final stages of the DOGE integration, with only a few\nremaining additions to complete, as well as proper testing to ensure they behave\nas expected in all cases, but we are now indeed in the final stage of the\nprocess.\n\nPrivate Offers  ?\nPrivate orderbook display + Identity stats + Various fixes. by gerlofvanek ·\nPull Request #193 · basicswap/basicswapUI: Added private orderbook display in\nthe network offers / your offers table. (Based on) To send a private\noffer:Recipient creates a new address to receive offers on.Recipient sends the\npubkey ...GitHubbasicswap [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/193]We've\nnow completed development of a new GUI feature that enables swap capabilities —\na functionality that has been available in the back-end for some time but lacked\nan intuitive user interface.\n\nAlongside private swap capabilities, we're introducing the first iteration of\nlocal identity reputation, a system that tracks your swap history and stats with\nspecific trading partners.\n\nOn BasicSwap, users can either generate a new identity for each swap to maximize\nprivacy, or they can choose to reuse the same identity to build reputation and\nrelationships with fellow traders.\n\nThe new GUI simplifies reputation building by providing clear statistics on each\nidentity used by your trading partners.\n\nIt's important to note that this initial reputation model is exclusively local —\nthe statistics displayed only reflect your personal interaction history with\neach user. This data remains on your device and is not broadcast to the network,\nensuring that privacy is maintained and no data is leaked.\n\nWhile we have plans for a more comprehensive, network-wide, node-based\nreputation system in the future, this week's implementation represents a\nsignificant step toward providing more reputation data on BasicSwap.\n\nFor users planning to act as market makers, liquidity providers, or frequent\ntraders on BasicSwap, we recommend considering whether building reputation with\none or more identities could benefit your trading strategy and help you build\ntrust with quality traders.\n\nThese new features — private swaps and local reputation — are now available in\nthe dev branch and will be merged into master with the next major BasicSwap\nproduction update.\n\nBetter Identity Management ?\nIn addition to the private swaps and local reputation capabilities, we've also\nimproved how identities are managed in the GUI, notably with better displaying\nand organizing of your identities and of BasicSwap's ability to add\ncomprehensive labels to the identities of other swappers.\n\nWhile this week's update is relatively modest when it comes to improvements made\nto identity management, we intend on delivering more updates on that front\nmoving forward as it is key to some of the larger features planned for\nBasicSwap.\n\nCodebase and Other General Improvements ?\nSeveral additional commits have been merged into the dev branch, encompassing\nboth back-end and front-end improvements.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nDogecoin Integration ?\nWe are in the final stages of the DOGE integration, with only a few remaining\nadditions to complete.\n\nWe're still testing the various components of this integration to ensure they\nbehave as expected in all cases, but we are now indeed in the final stage of the\nprocess.\n\nPrivate Offers  ?\nWe're completing development of a new GUI feature that enables private trading\ncapabilities — a functionality that has been available in the back-end for some\ntime but lacked an intuitive user interface.\n\nPrivate Offers (WIP)Private offers are coming to BasicSwap DEX, allowing users\nto publish offers visible only to specifically authorized parties. These offers\nwill appear in the authorized users' order books with a private tag, indicating\ntheir exclusive nature.\n\nThis feature will soon be available in the dev branch, and we'll provide updates\nas development progresses.\"\n\nWebsockets for Live Updates ?\nWe have completed the integration of websockets into BasicSwap, enabling instant\norder book updates rather than relying on timed refreshes.\n\nThis improvement is crucial as we move toward making BasicSwap's order book more\ndynamic and visually similar to centralized exchanges, with buy/sell side splits\nand depth chart functionality.\n\nUser Interface  ?️\nAdditionally, we continue to make progress on following items outlined\npreviously:\n\n * Development of a new \"quick swap\" page\n   [https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-06-12-2024/#quick-swaps-] \n   that allows users to more easily and accurately swap cryptocurrencies\n * Implementing server-side caching for rate and percentage calculations (in\n   progress, experimental)\n * Standardized modal system; replacing JavaScript popups with consistent,\n   global modal components\n * Various other tweaks and improvements\n\nBasicSwap and Particl in the Media ?️\nPrivacy Roundtable w/ Rachel Rose O'Leary ?️\nThis week's Privacy Roundtable featured a special discussion with Rachel-Rose\nO'Leary from Lunar Punk, joined by our friends from PIVX and Firo. If you missed\nthe live broadcast, you can watch the full episode at the link below.\n\nx.comX (formerly Twitter) [https://x.com/firoorg/status/1869380929896194489]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nDogecoin Integration ?\nWe are still working on the DOGE integration, which ended up taking a bit more\ntime than expected due to its peculiar codebase.\n\nHowever, we're happy to report that we've successfully implemented the majority\nof the possible swap paths using adaptor signature swaps and that the coin now\npasses most of the integration tests.\n\nWe're still testing the integration to ensure it behaves as expected in all\ncases, but it seems that we are now in the

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nDogecoin Integration ?\nWe are currently working through some of the challenges

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nMassive Update is Live ?\nBasicSwap Version 0.14.2 and GUI 3.1.1 Now AvailableBasicSwap’s new 3.1.1 user\ninterface and 0.14.2 codebase are now available, featuring a wide range of\nimprovements across the board.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-version-0-14-2-and-gui-3-1-1-now-available/]\nEarlier today, we've released a massive BasicSwap update that represents weeks\nof dedicated effort, incorporating numerous improvements, bug fixes, and new\nfeatures.\n\nAfter 112 commits from 6 different contributors, it welcomes Bitcoin Cash and\nimplements several key improvements across all aspects of the platform,\nincluding changes to the codebase, the user interface, and to individual coin\nintegrations such as Monero.\n\nNotably, a key technical change is the complete replacement of SQLAlchemy with\nmanbearpigSQL, our custom-built hybrid database system. This transition\nsimplifies BasicSwap's data management processes while solidifying security by\neliminating potential vulnerabilities.\n\nThis release took most of our time this week as we wrapped up several items for\nit. For more information and the full changelog, refer to the announcement blog\npost here\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-version-0-14-2-and-gui-3-1-1-now-available/].\n\nDogecoin Integration ?\nprobably nothing by nahuhh · Pull Request #175 · basicswap/basicswapGitHub\nbasicswap [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/175]Community contributor\nOfrnxmr has begun work on integrating Dogecoin (DOGE) into BasicSwap,\nindependent of today's update.\n\nWhile this might appear to be a straightforward integration, DOGE's legacy\ncodebase presents several technical challenges that we're currently working to\nresolve.\n\nWe'll continue to provide updates on the progress of this integration as\ndevelopment continues.\n\nBasicSwap Windows Installer ?‍♂️\nAlthough not yet re-released, the installer release remains imminent. There are\nstill a few things to wrap up before the release, and we'll finish up those now\nthat the BasicSwap DEX update has gone live.\n\nHowever, we want to clarify that this installer is simply a convenience tool to\nfacilitate building BasicSwap DEX from source on Windows. For Windows users, we\ncontinue to recommend using the Docker version, which remains our only\nofficially supported Windows implementation.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week has been a continuation of the work we've mentioned in last week's\nupdate, though we've got exciting and exclusive news to share.\n\nBitcoin Cash Integration Update ?\nAs announced earlier today on X by mainnet_pat\n[https://x.com/mainnet_pat/status/1857335162125648102], one of the main\ncontributors to the BCH <> XMR atomic swap protocol, the integration of Bitcoin\nCash on BasicSwap DEX has been extensively tested on mainnet and is now ready\nfor release.\n\nWe have thus merged a substantial series of commits\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commits/dev/?before=732c87b0130b57062a9693a203f96c50a6413555+35] \nto the dev branch (more specifically, commits dated today November 15th),\nenabling users to test the Bitcoin Cash integration on mainnet. We anticipate\nbringing this integration to the master branch during our next dev -> master \nmerge.\n\nCommits · basicswap/basicswapBasic Atomic Swap Proof of Concept. Contribute to\nbasicswap/basicswap development by creating an account on GitHub.GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commits/dev/?before=732c87b0130b57062a9693a203f96c50a6413555+35]\nWe extend our sincere gratitude to mainnet_pat for his exceptional work on this\nintegration. This valuable community contribution strengthens BasicSwap's\ndecentralized approach and represents another significant step toward achieving\nour mission.\n\nBasicSwap Codebase Improvements ✅\nAlong with today's large array of commits that have been added to the dev \nbranch, we've included a number of general codebase improvements and code\nclean-ups.\n\nNotably, we've resolved an issue with Monero wallets which should resolve a\nlong-standing issue that made BasicSwap become slower the longer you had been\nrunning your instance. This fix is a combination of BasicSwap improvements and\naccompanying fixes that have been published as pull requests to Monero earlier\ntoday (1 [https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/9571], 2\n[https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/9570]).\n\nOther updates, committed on November 15th\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commits/dev], include:\n\n * Large code formatting update, including tests (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/732c87b0130b57062a9693a203f96c50a6413555]\n   , 2\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/7b03ce476997ceee5f6b227c8a1b028175ed5b74]\n   )\n * Allow setting reserve below increment for market making script (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/373525b364249c493cc4dbd90fcfd62c38f009ff]\n   )\n * basicswap-prepare: don't start daemon if coin config exists in basicswap.json\n   (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/6be9a14335ac5b7893b231fd33983462bf90a93c]\n   )\n * Bypass Tor for .local domains (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/b484827c15fdc306a9dc8b6ce52117371142dcc0]\n   )\n * Fix error when txid is unknown (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/51c11793265045edce7239372748dc74cfea2664]\n   )\n * Fix unbound error when no wallet data is cached (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/b5f6eb65262fed1b731003b8248e34db57a32b45]\n   )\n * Adjust wallet name for Particl anon and blind interfaces (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/e28d41ed0caf4c3c28e6fbbf4d3385b48f7f38d6]\n   )\n * Add display_name to chainparams (1\n   [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commit/00d70f8cc72096f6f132d108a453d0512ad22c47]\n   )\n\nBasicSwap Windows Installer ?‍♂️\nWhile we have completed the majority of work on the new Windows installer as\nreported last week, we've chosen to focus this week's front-end efforts on\nBasicSwap GUI updates. These updates will begin rolling out to the dev branch in\ngreater numbers over the next few days.\n\nThe installer release remains imminent. However, we want to clarify that this\ninstaller is simply a tool to facilitate building BasicSwap DEX from source on\nWindows. For Windows users, we continue to recommend using the Docker version,\nwhich remains our only officially supported Windows implementation. We do not\nrecommend running BasicSwap directly on Windows.\n\nParticl and BasicSwap Media ?\nPrivacy Roundtable ?️\nx.comX (formerly Twitter)\n[https://x.com/BasicSwapDEX/status/1855017656576839694]Don't miss our upcoming\nPrivacy Roundtable on X Spaces with our friend from PIVX and Firo this coming\n20th of November at 9:00 AM EST!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nAutomated Marketplace Content Moderation ?\nDecentralized Moderation Meets Local AIDiscover the new automated, LLM-powered\nParticl Marketplace moderation script.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-moderation-meets-local-ai/]Earlier today, we\npublished the open-source code for the automated, LLM-powered Particl\nMarketplace content moderation script. \n\nThis helper script, which aims to streamline marketplace moderation by shifting\nthe moderation burden from end-users to more engaged community members (though\nend-users can still participate in content moderate as before), is built using\nPython and is available across Windows, MacOS, and Linux platforms.\n\nFor detailed insights into the system's architecture, check out our latest blog\npost here [https://particl.news/decentralized-moderation-meets-local-ai/]. Ready\nto get started? The setup guide is available in our Github README here\n[https://github.com/cryptoguard/particl-market-moderation-script/blob/master/README.md]\n.\n\nWe encourage you to try this new proactive moderation approach and share your\nfeedback. We're particularly excited about how this solution bridges two\ntransformative technologies - cryptocurrencies and LLMs - to address the complex\nchallenge of unbiased content moderation in decentralized systems.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week has been a continuation of the work we've mentioned in last week's\nupdate.\n\nBitcoin Cash Integration Update ?\nWe've continued assisting mainnet-pat with his Bitcoin Cash integration into\nBasicSwap, notably focusing on a few edge cases and the \"mercy path\". \n\nYou can keep track of some of the development on that end by monitoring\nTecnovert's fork of BasicSwap (here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commits/bch_staging/]), which serves as\na testing ground for features and updates that will later on make it to the\nofficial BasicSwap repository.\n\nBasicSwap Windows Installer ?‍♂️\nWe have completed the majority of work on the new Windows installer following\nextensive testing this week. However, we haven't been able to release it just\nyet, though we expect it to go live very shortly.\n\nFor context, we've adopted a new approach to the setup wizard that simplifies\nits flow and handles the installation process differently. This redesign aims to\nreduce potential failures that can occur across various Windows configurations.\n\nNew Display Type for Orders ?\nAs part of BasicSwap's current development cycle, we're reimagining the order\nbook display by introducing a new visualization option for available offers.\n\nWhile continuing to source data from the same network offers, the new interface\nwill more closely resemble traditional cryptocurrency exchanges. It will feature\na depth chart and a structured order book that displays both buy and sell offers\nin ascending order on opposite sides.\n\nThis enhancement aims to align BasicSwap's user experience with conventional\ntrading platforms, bridging the gap between atomic swap technology's benefits\nand the accessibility needed to achieve widespread adoption.\n\nParticl and BasicSwap Media ?\nPrivacy Roundtable ?️\nx.comX (formerly Twitter)\n[https://x.com/BasicSwapDEX/status/1855017656576839694]Don't miss our upcoming\nPrivacy Roundtable on X Spaces with our friend from PIVX and Firo this coming\n20th of November at 9:00 AM EST!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nMarketplace Moderation Update ?\nDue to a personal matter affecting one of our team members, we had to briefly\ndelay the release of the LLM-powered automated moderation script for Particl\nMarketplace due to that person's unavailability.\n\nHowever, this situation has now been resolved, and we plan to proceed with the\nrelease early next week.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nGeneral ✅\nWe've been looking into a few bugs and issues, notably as we've been\ninvestigating a bug reported by the community. As such, we've pushed a few fixes\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commits/dev] this week that should\nresolve most of them.\n\nNew Display Type for Orders ?\nAs part of BasicSwap's current development cycle, we're reimagining the order\nbook display by introducing a new visualization option for available offers.\n\nWhile continuing to source data from the same network offers, the new interface\nwill more closely resemble traditional cryptocurrency exchanges. It will feature\na depth chart and a structured order book that displays both buy and sell offers\nin ascending order on opposite sides.\n\nThis enhancement aims to align BasicSwap's user experience with conventional\ntrading platforms, bridging the gap between atomic swap technology's benefits\nand the accessibility needed to achieve widespread adoption.\n\nBitcoin Cash Nearly Ready for Deployment ?\nAs mentioned a few weeks ago, mainnet_pat, one of the creators of the BCH <> XMR\natomic swap protocol, has been working on integrating Bitcoin Cash into\nBasicSwap.\n\nThe integration is now in its final stages, as we review the code and\ncollaborate closely with mainnet_pat to ensure comprehensive coverage of all\nedge cases and scenarios.\n\nWe expect to provide a more detailed progress report next week, but we're\nexcited to share that Bitcoin Cash integration on BasicSwap is nearing\ncompletion!\n\nBasicSwap Windows Installer ?‍♂️\nWe have completed the majority of work on the new Windows installer following\nextensive testing this week.\n\nFor context, we've adopted a new approach to the setup wizard that simplifies\nits flow and handles the installation process differently. This redesign aims to\nreduce potential failures that can occur across various Windows configurations.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nMarketplace Moderation Update ?\nWe've rebased the marketplace moderation app in Python for better performance\nand compatibility over Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The rebase is nearly complete\nand we're wrapping up the last few functions and cleaning up the code.\n\nAdditionally, we've tested the moderation system on a wide range of listings,\nboth from Particl Marketplace but also from a large sample of test listings\nwe've curated to test the system against edge cases and more difficult to\ncategorize listings. The performance of the system is quite impressive, with a\n95%+ accuracy rate using template moderation rules (you can set your own rules). \n\nOther than modifying the moderation rules, we're exploring various solutions to\nimprove from that 95%+ mark, although those would have to be implemented after\nthe initial release of the app if they are deem worthy enough.\n\nWe should be ready to release the app within the next two weeks. We'll keep you\nup-to-date on the matter and will accompany the release with a detailed blog\npost that explains how the system works, how to use, and its best practices. \n\nBasicSwap ?\nCodebase ?\nWe've pushed a improvements and bug fixes to the BasicSwap codebase. While these\nchanges are not yet available from the master branch, you can access them by\nbuilding from the dev branch (see here\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commits/dev/]) or by consulting the Pull\nRequests (see here [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/127] and here\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/126]).\n\n * Converted the config and requirements setup from setup.py to the new, more\n   modern pyproject.toml standard,\n * Added max/min amounts to allow for better, more granular order book\n   management via the market making script (more improvements to the script and\n   how to interact with it currently in progress via contributions from\n   Ofrnxmr),\n * Fixed a bug when manually setting a bid to a new state,\n * Added BSX_TEST_MODE env variable to prepare script to manage all daemons by\n   default.\n\nUser Interface  ?️\nEarlier this week, we've pushed a Pull Request\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/126] that contains a\nwork-in-progress version of the next GUI update. Since then, we've continued\nimproving it and have merged portions of it into the dev branch, with more\nmerging to come in the next few days as we're still working on certain items.\n\nHere's what's been merged to the dev today:\n\n * Order book overhaul: implemented dynamic tables for offers (network offers)\n   and sentoffers (your offers), auto-refresh of the order book (without page\n   reloading), and the automated removal of expired offers and new listings,\n * Dynamic filters for tables,\n * Improved shutdown modal,\n * If shutdown created separate modal for in-progress swaps,\n * API: Fixed rate issues with main chart/prices,\n * API: Fixed rate issues with sent/sentoffers table,\n * API: Using one fetch for coins in one batch for all rates,\n * Fixed calculation market rate for profit/loss,\n * Added detailed tooltips for rate and profit/loss,\n * Fixed API calling separate, now using one requests,\n * Included assets (GFX) / implemented price/chart for Bitcoin Cash,\n * Update/fixes on main price chart,\n * Added 1M / 1W / 24H (main price chart),\n * Resolved auto-refresh bug (main price chart),\n * Code refactoring: Full refactor of offers/sentoffers JS,\n * Code refactoring: Full refactor of chart/price JS,\n *  Moved JS out of offers template,\n * Updated the spinning animation for enabling/disabling the auto-refresh chart\n   (now 3 seconds),\n * Added fiat denomination (USD) to the fiat value,\n * Moved fiat denomination to the top and fixed colors for dark theme\n   compatibility, \n * Fixed: Offers appearing multiple times when using filters,\n * Fixed: Filters on offers / sentoffers table. (Filter bids / Filter offers /\n   Filter Sending / Filter Receiving,\n * Bug/Fix: Added a unique filter ID for each listing to prevent duplicates,\n * UI: Removed USD values from the \"Max Send\" and \"Max Receive\" columns,\n * UI: All offers in the order book, including your own, should be displayed on\n   the right with other order book offers,\n * Fixed: Chart initial load after startup wasn’t loading prices for the tiles,\n   requiring a manual refresh.\n\nBitcoin Cash Integration ✅\n[WIP] Add BCH Support by mainnet-pat · Pull Request #124 · basicswap/basicswap\nHi, this PR is intended to track the progress of bitcoincash integration into\nBasicSwap DEX, I'd appreciate you reviewing it and helping me navigate\nthrough the integration process.As BCH is n...GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/124]We're happy to announce that\nmainnet_pat, one of the two developers that worked on delivering the XMR <> BCH\nprotocol [https://bounties.monero.social/posts/37/18-921m-bch-xmr-atomic-swaps],\nhas started working on a Bitcoin Cash integration into BasicSwap DEX. While not\nready yet, you can track progress and verify the code by monitoring the\nassociated Pull Request here [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/124].\n\nBCH requires a different integration protocol as Monero does not possess\nprogrammable outputs, and Bitcoin Cash isn't Segwit-enabled. \n\n> \"The protocols require the scriptable network to have 2nd-party malleability\nsolved and list SegWit as a requirement.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nParticl Team Proposal #5\nTeam Funding Request 5\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/team-funding-request-5.html]The voting for the\nfifth community funding proposal is now ongoing and will last from block\n1,755,500 to block 1,760,539 for a total of 5,040 blocks (approximately 1 week).\n\nBecause this proposal does not propose changes to the protocol, it requires a\nparticipation rate of at least 20% of the total supply and an approval rate of\n60% or more to be considered valid.\n\nYou can review the proposal\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/team-funding-request-5.html] and follow the\nvoting results directly on the CCS platform, or consult the blog post\n[https://particl.news/particl-team-funding-request-5/] for more information on\nhow to vote. As always, we highly encourage you to participate in this vote and\nlet your voice be heard.\n\nParticl Marketplace Update ?\nDevelopment of the LLM-powered moderation tool for Particl Marketplace continues\nto progress. We're currently in the process of integrating it with the\nmarketplace to enable broadcasting of its voting messages via SMSG.\n\nAs we connect the tool to the marketplace, we're identifying and implementing\nadditional functionalities that are crucial for ensuring a stable and\nuser-friendly experience.\n\nThis integration phase is expected to continue for some time. We'll provide an\nupdate when we're ready to expand our testing group and involve more\nparticipants in the process.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nAdaptor Signature Code Conversion ?\nWe've made further progress in converting the adaptor signature swaps to C++,\ncontinuing to develop and push code for this effort. Notably, we've updated the\ncustom secp256k1 library used in BasicSwap, which now has its own dedicated\nrepository on BasicSwap's GitHub.\n\nForked CoinCurve ✅\nWe've also forked and modified the coincurve library specifically for BasicSwap.\nThis customized version has been added to BasicSwap's GitHub organization,\nallowing for more control and better security of the protocol.\n\nUser Interface  ?️\nIn line with our new strategy of smaller, more frequent updates, we've continued\nto refine various user interface elements. These changes will be merged into the \ndev branch within the next few days. The upcoming update will include the\nfollowing improvements:\n\n 1. User-selectable default coin display on the chart, with Bitcoin as the\n    default if no choice is made\n 2. Replacement of load time with last refresh time on the chart\n 3. Fixed rate column display\n 4. Implementation of a Tor-compatible API for prices/rates across all templates\n    when Tor is enabled by the user\n 5.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nParticl Team Proposal #5\nTeam Funding Proposal #5 (Vote Scheduled)Learn all the details about the\nParticl\nteam’s fifth funding request from the Treasury Fund.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-team-funding-request-5/]The voting period for our\nfifth community funding proposal is now scheduled. Indeed, the vote will begin\nthis coming Monday the 16th of September, from block 1,755,500 to block\n1,760,539 for a total of 5,040 blocks (approximately 1 week).\n\nBecause this proposal does not propose changes to the protocol, it will require\na participation rate of at least 20% of the total supply and an approval rate of\n60% or more to be considered valid.\n\nYou can review the proposal\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/team-funding-request-5.html] and follow the\nvoting results directly on the CCS platform, or consult the blog post\n[https://particl.news/particl-team-funding-request-5/] for more information on\nhow to vote. As always, we highly encourage you to participate in this vote and\nlet your voice be heard.\n\nParticl Marketplace Update ?\nWe've continued work on the LLM-powered moderation tool for Particl Marketplace.\nNotably, we've had to rethink how listings are analyzed to ensure accurate\nresults, which we've now achieved (99%+ accuracy rate on test listings).\n\nWe will continue our testing and add in a few additional functions to cover edge\ncases and give more control to users before and after moderation. Then, we will\nbe ready to connect the script to the Particl network very shortly to ensure\nthat votes are broadcast to the marketplace.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nAdaptor Signature Code Conversion ?\nWe've continued our back-end efforts have primarily focused on converting\nBasicSwap's Python code to C++, particularly modules related to adaptor\nsignatures.\n\nThis extensive and time-consuming process is crucial for making BasicSwap's\nbidirectional adaptor signature swaps compatible with portable versions of the\nDEX, such as mobile or web applications. You can refer to past weekly updates\nfor more information on this item here\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-30-08-2024/#integration-layer-]\n.\n\nUser Interface  ?️\nEarlier this week, we've pushed a pull request to BasicSwap which has now been\nmerged into the dev branch [https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/commits/dev/]\n. The changes include the following:\n\n * Restructured and refactored Javascript for the Offers page.\n * Integrated TOR for API requests related to charts, rates, and coin prices.\n * Implemented a new chart (better layout) with options to toggle coin volume\n   and refresh the chart + clearing the cache upon refresh.\n * Added a 10-minute cache for all API requests, with an option for manual\n   refresh.\n * Disabled notifications for new offers to reduce spam, notifications for new\n   bids and bid acceptances remain active.\n * BSX on load will now redirect @ network offers page.\n * Applied various minor fixes.\n * Use readURL (if in basicswap.json \"use_tor\": true, it will use TOR as\n   default, if false it will use clearnet for APIs)\n * Warning when trying to shutdown button from the UI when a swap is ongoing\n\nKeeping on with our new strategy of smaller, but more frequent pushes, we will\npush more pull requets and merge more code in the next few days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nParticl Team Proposal #5\nOur fifth community funding proposal, which aims to finance the ongoing\noperations of current Particl and BasicSwap contributors as well as cover\nnetwork-related expenses, is still in its discussion phase.\n\nYou can review the proposal [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/24] \nin detail on the CCS platform, or for a more detailed overview, read the \nassociated blog post [https://particl.news/particl-team-funding-request-5/] on\nParticl News which provides additional context and information.\n\nWith discussions surrounding the proposal having subsided, we will soon schedule\nits voting phase and communicate the details to the community as a few days\nbefore it begins.\n\nParticl Marketplace Update ?\nThis week's efforts regarding the marketplace moderation system has once again\nbeen spent on testing and improving the system, notably with how the app\ninteracts with the distributed LLM network.\n\nThis is an important step as automated, LLM-driven moderation can have wide\nranging impact on the marketplace, and so must be done right.\n\nAt this time, we're looking to expand the LLM options made available to users to\nimprove the reliability of the moderation as well as incorporating a few new\nfunctions as a result of our testing.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nAdaptor Signature Code Conversion ?\nThis week, our back-end efforts have primarily focused on converting BasicSwap's\nPython code to C++, particularly modules related to adaptor signatures. \n\nThis extensive and time-consuming process is crucial for making BasicSwap's\nbidirectional adaptor signature swaps compatible with portable versions of the\nDEX, such as mobile or web applications. You can refer to past weekly updates\nfor more information on this item here\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-30-08-2024/#integration-layer-]\n.\n\nUser Interface  ?️\nWith our front-end developer back in full health, we've made progress on items\nslated for the next user interface update. We're finalizing the following\nimprovements, which will be gradually rolled out on GitHub (dev branch) over the\nnext day or two:\n\n 1. Refactoring of the JavaScript code for the Network Offers (order book) page,\n    providing:\n\n * Greater flexibility for current and future price and rate displays\n * Improved API key management and usage\n * A more streamlined price chart\n\n2. Bug fix for the shutdown button, preventing DEX shutdown during active swaps\n\n3. Improvements to the Create New Offers page, including better rate display\n(replacing the JSON-style format)\n\n4. Upgraded notification system\n\nMoving forward, we plan to implement a strategy of smaller, more frequent\nupdates on GitHub, rather than waiting to bundle larger updates. This approach\nwill facilitate easier participation from open-source contributors as the\ncodebase evolves.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nParticl Team Proposal #5\nOur fifth community funding proposal, which aims to finance the ongoing\noperations of current Particl and BasicSwap contributors as well as cover\nnetwork-related expenses, is still in its discussion phase.\n\nYou can review the proposal [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/24] \nin detail on the CCS platform, or for a more detailed overview, read the \nassociated blog post [https://particl.news/particl-team-funding-request-5/] on\nParticl News which provides additional context and information.\n\nWith discussions surrounding the proposal having resurfaced throughout the week,\nwe opted to keep the proposal in its discussion phase for a little more time.\nHowever, we do expect to move it to the voting phase shortly, and we'll\ncommunicate the details to the community as promptly as possible.\n\nParticl Marketplace Update ?\nThis week's efforts regarding the marketplace moderation system has been spent\non testing and improving the system, notably with how the app interacts with the\ndistributed LLM network.\n\nAs such, work on the system is still ongoing as we're making changes as they are\nrequired. \n\nTo provide maximum clarity about the architecture of this system, its\nimplications, and the way it is expected to be used by users that wish to\nparticipate in moderating the marketplace, we plan to publish a detailed blog\npost on Particl News which will cover all the basics. However, we are waiting\nfor the system to be completed and ready to be deployed first to allow us the\nflexibility to make any necessary adjustments to the system's components before\nrelease.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nOrder Book Monitoring ?️\nWe've made further progress on the system to extract and publicly broadcast data\nfrom BasicSwap's order book that was mentioned last week. This data can be used\nto display BasicSwap-related information in various formats, such as the more\nCEX-like order book interface shown in the screenshot above.\n\nIn the near future, we plan to make this interface accessible at \noffers.basicswapdex.com, including the ability to fetch rates without running\nBasicSwap locally, a feature that will benefit third-party contributors looking\nto utilize this data for a variety of reasons.\n\nWe also plan integrating, later on, this type of order book display directly\ninto BasicSwap as an additional way to view the order book. Note, however, that\nwe do intend on maintaining the current \"marketplace-like\" interface as well,\nproviding users with multiple viewing options.\n\nUser Interface  ?️\nWork continues on BasicSwap's broader set of user interface updates. However,\njust like last week, our front-end development efforts have been divided between\nthis task and the aforementioned data processing work. As a result, while the\nupcoming GUI updates are still in progress, we expect to release them soon.\n\nIntegration Layer ?\nWe have begun the process of converting portions of the BasicSwap codebase to\nC++. This conversion is a crucial step towards integrating adaptor signature\natomic swaps into third-party platforms.\n\nWhile it's challenging to provide a precise timeline for this task, it\nrepresents a significant milestone in our roadmap, achieving our goals of:\n\n 1. Making BasicSwap compatible with third-party platforms,\n 2. Significantly improving the user experience by integrating the DEX's\n    protocol to portable platforms, such as mobile applications.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nParticl Team Proposal #5\nLast week, we published our fifth community funding proposal which aims to\nfinance the ongoing operations of current Particl and BasicSwap contributors, as\nwell as cover network-related expenses.\n\nYou can review the proposal [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/24] \nin detail on the CCS platform, or for a more detailed overview, read the \nassociated blog post [https://particl.news/particl-team-funding-request-5/] on\nParticl News which provides additional context and information.\n\nWith discussions surrounding the proposal having subsided, it's time to move\nforward with the voting process to determine its approval by Particl\nstakeholders. We will soon schedule the proposal's voting period and communicate\nthe details to the community as promptly as possible.\n\nParticl Marketplace Update ?\nWe have made good progress in merging the listing scanner API with the\nAI-powered moderation system. While this integration is still ongoing and\nrequires further testing, we are pleased with the advancements made this week on\nthat end.\n\nThe listing scanner API has now been merged with the AI-powered moderation\nsystem, with the latter now being mostly complete. We are currently testing the\nsystem and will proceed to start connecting to the marketplace to ensure that\nvotes on listings are properly broadcast to the network.\n\nTo provide maximum clarity about the architecture of this system, its\nimplications, and the way it is expected to be used by users that wish to\nparticipate in moderating the marketplace, we plan to publish a detailed blog\npost on Particl News which will cover all the basics. However, we are waiting\nfor the system to be completed and ready to be deployed first to allow us the\nflexibility to make any necessary adjustments to the system's components before\nrelease.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nOrder Book Monitoring ?️\nBasicSwap front-end developer, Crz, has begun work on a system to extract and\npublicly broadcast data from BasicSwap's order book. This development will allow\ncontributors to access and utilize various data points for multiple use cases\nwithout the need to run a local version of BasicSwap.\n\nThe tool will offer greater insight and visibility into available liquidity on\nBasicSwap DEX and the relationships between different offers, enabling\ncontributors to seamlessly integrate the data into their own products or\napplications.\n\nExample of use-case leveraging extracted BasicSwap data (traditional CEX-like\nUI)As illustrated above, the data encompasses a wide range of properties and can\nbe applied to diverse scenarios, including alternative order book display\nmethods, rate comparisons, market depth analysis, and more.\n\nUser Interface  ?️\nWhile we've pushed a minor GUI fix with regards to QR code, we've continued work\non BasicSwap's larger user interface update coming up soon, although time on\nthat end has been shared with building the aforementioned data broadcasting\nsystem.\n\nAs such, the upcoming GUI updates are still work-in-progress but should be\nreleased shortly.\n\nIntegration Layer ?\nThis week, we've continued R&D with regards to messaging protocols in the\ncontext of a more portable version of BasicSwap (via the integration layer).\nWe're currently exploring tapping directly into the SMSG network, without\nrequiring a local SMSG node, which would provide the ability to use SMSG without\nrunning a Particl node on portable (mobile) devices. \n\nWhile possible, we are currently testing what sort of performance using such a\nsetup would result in, and if realistically usable, will likely end up being how\nportable versions of BasicSwap allow peers to communicate swap data with each\nother and access the DEX's order book (with alternative messaging layers being\nimplemented as a secondary priority).\n\nAdditionally, we have begun research and early work into converting some of\nBasicSwap's components into C++, a requirement to allow for portable versions of\nBasicSwap that include adaptor signature atomic swaps and not just HTLC ones.\nWork on that end is likely to take a couple of weeks.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nParticl Team Proposal #5 \nTeam Funding Proposal #5Learn all the details about the Particl team’s fifth\nfunding request from the Treasury Fund.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-team-funding-request-5/]Earlier this week, we\npublished our fifth community funding proposal which aims to finance the ongoing\noperations of current Particl and BasicSwap contributors, as well as cover\nnetwork-related expenses.\n\nYou can review the proposal [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/24] \nin detail on the CCS platform, or for a more detailed overview, read the \nassociated blog post [https://particl.news/particl-team-funding-request-5/] on\nParticl News which provides additional context and information.\n\nIf you have questions, comments, or feedback regarding the proposal, feel free\nto discuss it within the community channels or leave a direct comment on the CCS\nproposal page (https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/24).\n\nParticl Marketplace Update ?\nWe have made good progress in merging the listing scanner API with the\nAI-powered moderation system. While this integration is still ongoing and\nrequires further testing, we are pleased with the advancements made this week on\nthat end.\n\nUpon completion of this merger, our next step will be to connect the new\nmoderation system to the marketplace itself, ensuring that nodes properly\nbroadcast their votes when they need to and that they're applied to the relevant\nlistings.\n\nTo provide maximum clarity about the architecture of this system, its\nimplications, and the way it is expected to be used by users that wish to\nparticipate in moderating the marketplace, we plan to publish a detailed blog\npost on Particl News which will cover all the basics. However, we are waiting\nfor the system to be completed and ready to be deployed first to allow us the\nflexibility to make any necessary adjustments to the system's components before\nrelease.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nUser Interface  ?️\nWe've unfortunately hit some delays pushing the fixes we wanted to over the week\nas our front-end developer has been mostly unavailable due to health reasons.\nFor this reason, the GUI-related section of this progress report remains the\nsame as it was last week.\n\nThat means we're still gearing up to push a minor update in the next couple of\ndays that will fix a few bugs and include a few improvements, notably to the\ndisplay of QR codes in some cases.\n\nFurthermore, we're hoping for a release of the larger GUI update we've been\nworking on for the past few weeks somewhere next week, if all goes well.\n\nThis larger update will soon be available on GitHub and, as always, and you'll\nbe able to test the changes before they go live by switching to the dev branch.\nThe smaller update, however, will be available directly from the master branch.\n\nIntegration Layer ?\nWe have continued our investigation into the integration of new, alternative\nmessaging protocols into BasicSwap. This would serve two primary purposes: to\nfacilitate the integration of BasicSwap into third-party applications, which\ncarry their own restrictions, and to provide a backup solution to SMSG in\nscenarios where scalability becomes an issue, such as during a sudden,\nsignificant increase in the number of swaps.\n\nAt this time, we are evaluating several options and are also considering\nstandardizing the integration of messaging layers, which could lead to a\nplugin-like system. This approach would allow users to select their preferred\nmessaging layers in the options, but it is still unclear whether or not that\nwill be the preferable path to follow. While our exploration in this area is\nongoing, we have made satisfactory progress in our research and expect to be\nable to take a decision about it shortly.\n\nAdditionally, following discussions with potential partners, we are reviewing\nsections of the BasicSwap codebase that will likely need to be converted into\ndifferent programming languages to ensure proper integration of the DEX into\nthese third-party platforms and to leverage their infrastructure (e.g.,\nintegrated light node). Although this may involve a substantial amount of work,\nit is crucial for simplifying future integrations and improving fundamental\naspects of the codebase at the same time.\n\nIt's important to note that while we do have several individual components\nrequired for this integration layer either in place or at various stages of\ndevelopment, we are still in the early phases of this process and haven't yet\nfully transitioned out of the R&D phase. As such, we may need to refine or\niterate these components as we progress.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nParticl Marketplace Update ?\nWe have completed development of a market listing scanner that enables the new,\nimproved moderation system to extract relevant information and feed it into a\ndistributed network of Large Language Model (LLM) for moderation purposes.\n\nOur current focus is now on integrating the two systems — the market scanner and\nthe LLM-powered moderation tool. Once this integration is complete, we will be\nready to deploy the new system.\n\nIt's important to note that the new moderation tool is entirely optional; no\nuser will be required to run it nor will it come pre-packaged with or\nenabled-by-default in Particl Core. Additionally, moderation policies are fully\ncustomizable and are set by the individual user running an instance of this\nsystem. These policies are defined using natural language, thus allowing for a\nvery intuitive setup.\n\nWe want to emphasize that our team does not, and will not, enforce specific\nmoderation policies or maintain a ban list. Decentralization is a fundamental\nprinciple in everything we do at Particl, and we are committed to upholding this\nvalue.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nUser Interface  ?️\nWe're gearing up to push a minor update in the next day or two that will fix a\nfew bugs and include a few improvements, notably to the display of QR codes in\nsome cases.\n\nFuthermore, we're hoping for a release of the larger GUI update we've been\nworking on for the past few weeks somewhere next week, if all goes well.\n\nThis larger update will soon be available on GitHub and, as always, and you'll\nbe able to test the changes before they go live by switching to the dev branch.\nThe smaller update, however, will be available directly from the master branch.\n\nIntegration Layer ?\nWe're currently exploring a new, alternative messaging protocol for the purpose\nof integrating BasicSwap into third-party applications more easily as well as to\nprovide a fallback solution to SMSG in cases where it wouldn't scale enough\n(e.g., a sudden massive spike in the number of swaps).\n\nThis research is part of our ongoing efforts in building BasicSwap's integration\nlayer, which is the next major milestone for the DEX and the Particl ecosystem\nas a whole. \n\nIn the interest of deploying integratable BasicSwap-powered solutions to\npartners more quickly, we are considering a phased approach. For instance, this\nstrategy may involve initially enabling UTXO <> UTXO swaps using HTLC (\"Secret\nHash\") atomic swaps, followed by a gradual implementation of the broader range\nof features and capabilities offered by BasicSwap over time.\n\nIt's important to note that, while we do have individual components required for\nthis integration layer either in place or at various stages of development, we\nare still in the early phases of this process.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nParticl Marketplace Update ?\nWe're currently working on a marketplace message scanner to extract the relevant\ninformation that needs to be analyzed by the LLM-powered moderation script. This\nis our current focus as the portion of the work relating to the LLM logic is now\ncomplete and awaiting the delivery of the scanner.\n\nOnce completed, the next step will be to merge it with the marketplace-related\ncomponent of the system, and then test it extensively before release.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nUser Interface  ?️\nWe've continued with work on improvements to the user interface, including an\nimprovement to the rate system and how coin prices are fetched. The upcoming\nupdate will also contain a full redesign of the new offer page, a redesign of\nthe current \"swaps in progress\" page, a new index page, as well as the inclusion\nof better defined \"terms and conditions\" (taken from BasicSwap's website here\n[https://basicswapdex.com/terms]) that the users will have to accept after\nsetting up BasicSwap for the first time. \n\nAdditionally, we're working on a series of general changes and improvements to\nthe codebase, such as a more distributed API key management system.\n\nThese updates will soon be available on GitHub and, as always, you'll be able to\ntest these changes before they go live by switching to the dev branch.\n\nIntegration Layer ?\nSince coming back from the 2024 Litecoin Summit, we've started designing the\nintegration layer that will make it possible to integrate swap capabilities into\nthird-party applications or on the web.\n\nWhile actual coding hasn't officially started, we expect to begin within a few\ndays as we iron out the last few details. This item is the next major milestone\nfor BasicSwap and will dramatically improve its user experience by making it\nmore intuitive and easy to use via leverage of third-party applications such as\nalready-established crypto wallets or fully integrated web platforms.\n\nAs always, we're designing this integration layer in such a way that will\npreserve decentralization and privacy as much as possible, as per the usual\nethos that comes with BasicSwap and Particl. \n\nAdditionally, working on this integration layer will carry the additional\nbenefit of completing several milestones identified in community contributor\nOfrnxmr's proposal here\n[https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/ccs-proposals/-/merge_requests/457].\n\nParticl and BasicSwap Media ?\nPrivacy Roundtable ?️\nDon't miss our upcoming Privacy Roundtable on X Spaces with our friend from PIVX\nand Firo this coming 5th of August at 9:00 AM EST as we discuss Zcash funding\noperations and improvements, among other topics!\n\nx.comX (formerly Twitter) [https://x.com/_PIVX/status/1819360462598795374]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
