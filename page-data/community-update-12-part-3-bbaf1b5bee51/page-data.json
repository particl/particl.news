Of course, as there was a couple of presentations happening at the same time, the team did not get to see the entirety of the scheduled presentations, sometimes missing some due to networking outside of the rooms, but none of the ones we attended at live demos.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vfFNlVkVP_0?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id=\"particl-in-the-philippines-manila-s-blockchain-christmas-fair\">Particl in the Philippines — Manila’s Blockchain Christmas Fair</h3><p><a href=\"https://block-chats.com/christmas-fair-2018\"><strong>14 Dec | Manila’s Blockchain Christmas Fair — BLOCKCHATS — Blockchain Events + Lifestyle</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://block-chats.com/christmas-fair-2018\"><em>Browse the nerdiest Christmas fair of the year and grab merchandise, souvenirs, and your Christmas dinner from the…</em></a><a href=\"https://block-chats.com/christmas-fair-2018\">block-chats.com</a></p><p>On the 14th of December, Particl organized <a href=\"https://block-chats.com/christmas-fair-2018/\"><strong>Manila’s Blockchain Christmas Fair</strong></a> alongside <a href=\"https://block-chats.com/\"><strong>Block-chats</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.coding-girls.com/\"><strong>Coding Girls Manila</strong></a>.

They used\nthis opportunity to record an AMA/FAQ session to answer some of the questions\nthat have been asked on Reddit.\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/a0lbbf/amafaq_with_special_guest_lina_seiche_recording/]\n\nDue to limited time and the unusually high amount of questions received for this\nAMA/FAQ, the team couldn’t answer all the questions while in Toronto but did so\nin the Reddit thread itself. For the purpose of this Community Update, we’ve\ncompiled all the answers, including those answered in the video.\n\n> Video Questions\n(3:01 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=181]) Can we expect in-client messaging\nfor the main net?\nIn-client messaging will be a new feature introduced into the marketplace as we\nwork towards a fully loaded main release. We have a bunch of new features queued\nup on the development side, and when one of them gets ready for testing, it’ll\nbe released as a new Release Candidate (RC). The release strategy for Beta will\nbe different than during Alpha. Instead of working on several tasks at one, the\nteam will start focusing on one feature at a time, allowing for more frequent\nand exciting Release Candidates. You can get a list of features being\nconsidered/worked on by reading the South Africa development update\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11] posted on\nour blog.\n\nSouth Africa Team Meetings Update\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nAs you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa\nfrom the 16th of November to the 24th…\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\n\nQ&A Communications on Listing PagesWe do see in-client messaging integrated into\nthe shopping experience in more ways than just buyer ←→ seller. One example of\nthis can be seen in a gif posted on Github\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1323] by our UI/UX and\nfront-end developer, Martin Allien, that showed a way to communicate with a\nseller by asking questions (as well as see previous questions from other users)\ndirectly on the listing page. This is not unlike the popular Q&A format used on\nAmazon and is a simple but useful communications tool providing value to buyers.\n\nAnother messaging mechanism we’d like to eventually implement would be group\nchats, most likely integrated into private markets (or Bubbles) and also as a\nstand-alone. This would provide more tools for people to form sub-communities,\nespecially niche or trading internet communities (i.e. the now banned \n/r/beertrade Reddit community [https://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade]) directly\nwithin Particl Desktop and not have to use different apps for communications.\nThis would go a long way into making Particl even more present in your\nday-to-day life.\n\n(3:49 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=229]) Will there be a Decentralized\nExchange integration?\nThe team hasn’t roadmapped or even met about creating a Particl DEX integration\nat this point in time. A lot of us in the community, as well as in the team,\nfeel it’ll be a good complement to the marketplace so the idea definitely will\nget some discussion time at some point. Right now, we’re focused on marketplace\nintegrations that usher in features that make our crypto-agnostic vision a\nreality. For this, we have several options we could leverage, including a\nChangelly or a similar third-party integration.\n\nWhile a proper Particl-made DEX might not come at any point soon in time, it\ndoesn’t mean we aren’t willing to integrate already existing DEX into the\nParticl platform. It may even be a more ideal path to follow, at least in the\nshort-term, as volume is important on DEX, just like on any other exchange, and\nthat integrating already popular solutions would help with kickstarting the\nvolume.\n\nExample of How Atomic Swaps Could be Implemented (Stand-alone)As such, we are\nactively looking at all the DEX projects being built within the space, and when\none of them gets stable enough and fits our requirements to be integrated, then\nwe might work toward making that a reality by first getting listed on there, and\nthen integrating it into the platform. This, of course, would be something we’d\nkeep the community in the know about any development on that front!\n\n(4:27 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=284]) Moving forward, what role will\nMiguel Cuneta and John Bailon play in Particl?\nAll of our advisors are entrepreneurs and have many focuses, including Particl.\nMost of them are actual active community members, promoting Particl in their own\ncircles, events, and towns. A good example of that can be seen in Miguel’s\nlatest videos that have been posted on our Youtube channel\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnuttPuAY6AOenTz2GGMnbg] as well as in \nDeutsche Welle’s documentary [https://youtu.be/-Jn41vwZd94] he and Lina Seiche\nwere featured on last month.\n\nDW’s Documentary:\n\nMeeting Miguel Cuneta, Particl Advisor:\n\nHumans of Crypto, Episode 1 — Miguel Cuneta:\n\nTo date, we haven’t necessarily engaged all of our advisors very much with\nagendas as we’ve been in the middle of a heavy development phase. Beginning in\n2019, as we release Beta and Alpha mainnet, we’ll definitely be engaging each of\nour advisors more, having regular strategy meetings, more promotions on social\nmedia, and just overall leveraging their business abilities more. 2019 will be a\nvery different year for the Particl project, especially as we enter a production\nphase, and so the team will have different focuses where our advisors will be of\ntremendous help.\n\nWith Lina being stationed in the Philippines, we’ve already started to engage\nmore with our advisors from SCI [http://sci.ph], Miguel Cuneta and John Bailon,\nand you can expect them to be even more visible and involved this year.\n\n(6:22 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=382]) Can we expect a fiat gateway\nintegration into the Particl client?\nWe know that in order to reach some levels of mainstream adoption which is,\nafter all, a goal of the project, there needs to be as many payment options as\npossible. Accepting many cryptocurrencies is definitely a good way to achieve\nthis, and this is one of the features that are likely to be implemented in one\nof our Beta release candidate, but also accepting more traditional forms of\npayment is a huge leap forward for the platform to be used by a more mainstream\ntype of audience. This is the reason why fiat gateways\n\nWe need to find the right fit that doesn’t compromise Particl’s core values. We\nhave looked at services that have fiat gateways and PART already, such as\nIndaCoin, but so far haven’t found one that meets the project’s standards of\nprivacy and security.\n\nFor the time being, we know Mubiz [https://mubiz.com/] plans on tackling that\naspect for buyers, albeit for a fee, so definitely keep your eyes on them!\n\n(7:34) Does the recent SEC ruling affect Particl in any material way?\nOur legal team keeps us on the path that is straight and narrow. Regulations are\nconstantly changing and the key to complying with current and future laws is to\nplay by the rules from the beginning. As such, we are confident that we are\nfully compliant with any current regulation and are constantly having our legal\nteam stay ahead of the curve and in the know of any change in regulations.\nCompliance and “doing it right” is a major focus of the project, and we fully\nintend on staying that way moving forward.\n\n(8:23 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=503]) How will atomic swaps be\nincorporated into Particl on a user interface-level?\nYou can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well\nas\nParticl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on\nour blog. [https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\n\nExample of a Possible Atomic Swap Implementation (Stand-alone)There are mostly\ntwo UI/UX implementations we are looking into for Particl Desktop. Having atomic\nswaps be incorporated as part of the checkout process of the marketplace is one\npath. Another parallel path is having an atomic swaps dapp that is independent\nof the marketplace and acts as a p2p, private decentralized exchange. An\nimplementation like this would also be very useful for future Particl Dapps\nsince it would live independently of the marketplace.\n\nYou can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well\nas\nParticl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on\nour blog. [https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\n\n(9:05 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=545]) What does Lina consider to be the\nmost exciting aspect about Particl?\nParaphrased from Lina:\n\n> I’m still learning every day about the project, but one of the most exciting\nthings I find about Particl is that it is a “no non-sense project”. This is\nobviously something the community appreciates as well, and when you get\nacquainted with the team, you understand that they are really not here for the\nhype, or the buzzwords, or the money. They have actually been around for a while\nand they all work out of conviction/ideology. I believe this project is here to\npush good values and useful technologies like privacy and security into the\ncryptocurrency space.I also like that Particl does things differently from other\nprojects, being focused on development instead of hype and promises. It is one\nof the few projects that have made the jump from being purely a concept to an\nactual product that can be shown and demoed. In the end, we can talk about\nrevolution all we like, but unless we deliver results, we’ll always be stuck in\nthis bad position that you have nothing that can be used, only concepts, and you\nfind yourself with very little adoption. Particl is pioneering and delivering,\nand that’s very exciting to see. If next week you ask me how excited I am about\nthe project, then I would probably tell you that I am even more excited!\n\nParaphrased from Paul:\n\n> Just to add on what Lina is saying, we’re here today in Toronto for demoing\nParticl Marketplace in a demo-focused event. We realize however that we are\npretty much one of the only projects in the space with a properly working\nproduct, although currently only on testnet. Most projects in the space are\nstill stuck on sales pitches, and I want to give props to our developers for\ntheir talent and passion making all of this a reality. We were very well\nreceived in Toronto and it was cool to show off how to people a working\nblockchain product.\n(11:58 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=718]) Can you give us a brief summary of\nyour week in South Africa?\nWe have made a dedicated blog post about all the details of the South Africa\ndevelopment meeting. You can read it by clicking on the following link:\n\nSouth Africa Team Meetings Update\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nAs you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa\nfrom the 16th of November to the 24th…\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\n\nAside from all the features the team has decided to explore for Beta, a lot of\nthe meetings were about discussing ways the whole development process could be\nimproved.\n\nAmong the couple of tweaks made to it, one of them was the new release strategy\nfor Beta. Basically, the development of the marketplace will now be split into\ntwo branches: dev and stable. The dev branch will be the “experimental” one\nwhere new features will first be released on testnet. New features can break\nstuff, and having a broken build when you want to show it to people is not very\nhelpful and can even be counter-productive. That’s where a stable branch comes\nin handy. This branch only gets new features added to it once they have been\nproperly tested and fully debugged, making much more stable for demonstration\nand testing purposes.\n\nAdditionally, the release strategy will now be different than how it was during\nAlpha. Instead of focusing on several features and functions at the same time,\neach development team will now focus on mostly one feature at a time, ensuring\nmore frequent and exciting releases. Each of these Release Candidates will bring\nfor testing new features, such as various messaging mechanisms, reputation,\nprivacy, gateways, inventory management, and more. As Alpha was all about\ndeveloping the base layer for the marketplace, Beta will be about adding new\nfeatures, starting with the most necessary ones. These features will be able to\nbe added at a much faster pace than before, and so we expect the Beta phase of\ndevelopment to be very exciting for everyone!\n\nWe’ve also decided that, parallel to the two testnet branches, we’d also finally\nrelease Particl Marketplace Alpha on mainnet. We’re currently in the last mile\nbefore our first mainnet marketplace release which will mark a glorious\nmilestone for the project. The team is currently entirely focused on making the\ncurrent Alpha build fully stable, and is making the final touches before it goes\nlive on mainnet. New features will start being developed only after the Alpha\nversion of the marketplace is pushed onto mainnet.\n\nAnother topic discussed in Africa and not necessarily related to development was\nour decision to start attending more events, do more meetups, sponsorships, and\nboots-on-the-ground campaigns. Directly related to that is the announcement\nwe’ve made in December that we’d be attending Asia Crypto Week’s flagship event,\nTOKEN2049.\n\nParticl is Going to Hong Kong’s TOKEN 2049 Conference\n[https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b]\nDirectly in line with our “boots-on-the-ground” intention of being present at\nmore conferences around the world…\n[https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b]\n\n(15:01 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=901]) Is there going to be a meetup\nin France?\nYes, we are in the middle of preparing an event we’ll be presenting at Paris’ \nCoinHouse [https://www.coinhouse.com/] late in February. CoinHouse is the\nleading Bitcoin and cryptocurrency hub in France\n[https://business.lesechos.fr/entrepreneurs/idees-de-business/0600016133318-coinhouse-le-grand-magasin-du-bitcoin-324430.php] \nwith over 100,000 customers, 35,000 of them being considered as “active”. It\noffers a wide array of services including educational information, investment\nadvice\n[https://www.capital.fr/entreprises-marches/bitcoin-coinhouse-peut-desormais-faire-du-conseil-en-investissement-1305686] \n (approved by France’s AMF), OTC Bitcoin purchases and sales, and more. As part\nof their educational mission and community-driven initiatives, they hold very\npopular meetups, conferences, and other types of events that can be attended by\nthe France cryptocurrency community. The startup has also been the home of the\nnow widely-known and popular startup Ledger [http://ledger.com], which now have\na product (Ledger Nano S) that is compatible with Particl for hardware storage\nand cold staking\n[https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae].\nCoinHouse is also partnered with renowned Paris Universities HEC\n[http://www.hec.edu/] and Polytechnique [https://www.polytechnique.edu/] and now\noffers blockchain classes to students.\n\nLa Maison du Bitcoin Rebrands as Coinhouse\n[https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d]\nLeading cryptoasset investment with new platform, services and visual identity\n[https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d]\nmedium.com\n[https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d]\n\nThis event is very likely to include several presentations from not only team\nmembers, but also from both community members Ben and Albin Cauderlier from\nMubiz. More information about this event will follow in the next few days.\n\n(16:52 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1012]) Will there be another\nPARTaker Hub?\nWe have no immediate plan for rebooting the Partaker Hub. We are looking into\nseveral ways to increase awareness and it may make a comeback at some point in\ntime, although under a different and improved form, but it is not a short-term\ngoal.\n\n(17:44 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1064]) Will there be a coin weight\nfeature enabling large holders to easily remove products (e.g. those of a\ncompetitor) from the market?\nIt shouldn’t be possible to do but never say never. The development of\ngovernance with coin weight is now finished and the mechanism is undergoing\nseveral rounds of tests. This feature will be on the next stable Alpha release\nand part of the first mainnet version of the marketplace. Moving the initial\ngovernance system onto mainnet is the best way to see how it holds up against\nabuse when real funds are on the line. Our team will constantly be monitoring\nhow the first mainnet governance system holds up in real-life and will be ready\nto make any improvement deemed necessary, if any. Being among the first, if not\nthe first, at building a truly decentralized governance model of an eCommerce is\na hell of a task with very few prior examples to refer to. The first mainnet\nmodel perhaps won’t be perfect, but we have to start somewhere and then improve\nas we go. This, after all, is the mentality of pioneers!\n\n(18:32 [https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1112])— What added value could SCI\nprovide for Particl?\nSimilarly to the previous question about our advisors, we intend on leveraging\nthe founders of SCI, Miguel Cuneta and John Bailon, good friends to the project,\nmuch more starting this year. As we shift towards a different stage of the\nproject, one that is likely to be much more business-minded than last year,\ntheir expertise and network could become very handy.\n\nSCI - Home [https://sci.ph/]\nSatoshi Citadel Industries (Bitmarket.ph Inc.) is a financial technology\ncompany\nbuilding the Blockchain ecosystem in… [https://sci.ph/]sci.ph [https://sci.ph/]\n\nSatoshi Citadel Industries is one of the first and biggest blockchain companies\nin the Philippines. They are very involved with the community and also very well\nreputed. They sponsor all sorts of events, frequently get TV time, and even\nadvise the local government, banks, and financial institutions. We plan on doing\nlots of events and joint projects together in the Philippines, and their\ninfluence and network will undoubtedly take the project places.\n\n> Other Questions\nWhat’s happening with the Particl/PivX alliance?\nThe biggest event to come out of this alliance is the inclusion of PART to zDEX\ngenesis launch and zDEX being integrated onto Particl Desktop at some point in\ntime. PART is one of 7 coins included in the initial launch of that\ndecentralized exchange.\n\nWhat about the social media strategy? How will this evolve with mainnet?\nWe’ve brought on Lina as our Lead Community Evangelist. She’s a social\njuggernaut and event planner, speaker among many things. The community will\nbegin seeing more video shorts, graphic eye candy and other treats on Twitter,\nYouTube, and Instagram in 2019.\n\nBoth Particl the platform and Particl Open Marketplace will have their own\nsocial calendars and marketing missions that are independent and play off of\neach other. Even though at this moment the target audiences of both items are\ncryptocurrency users, we see the marketplace veering off into more mainstream\nonline buyers and sellers as the year goes by and our products get the necessary\nfeatures required to appeal to a more mainstream target audience.\n\nWhat about the vendor outreach and recruitment strategy? Has this been developed\nand if so how will it be implemented and what can we expect?\nLarge-scale vendor recruitment won’t come until after a full Beta release\ncontaining all the planned features that define that release. It could even be\nlater than that, after we integrate more features, especially as it relates to\nmore “mainstream”, non-geeky vendors. The reason for an even later date than\nBeta to begin recruitment of more mainstream vendors is that they are used to\nwork on web pages and/or mobile apps. Being a downloadable marketplace keeps our\nadoption rate low until our mobile/web interfaces are developed but rest\nassured, these are absolutely planned.\n\nFor this reason, we expect some of the first vendors to be those operating in\nniche industries, vendors facing difficulties with payment processors and/or\ncertain regulations, as well as people looking into acquiring cryptocurrencies.\nIn other words, as the first mainnet versions of the marketplace might be more\nlimited in terms of features, the first vendors are likely to be those suffering\nthe most from the centralized infrastructure of online eCommerce and that will\nbenefit the most from the perks offered by decentralization (barely any fee,\ncensorship-proof, privacy, etc).\n\nAs Beta Release Candidates start to be released, each of them will contain new\nfeatures that are likely to grow the target audience each time they get added.\nWhether it be messages, improved privacy, inventory management, or reputation,\neach new feature makes the marketplace more attractive and user-friendly to a\nwider audience.\n\nWe already have a pretty good idea of the types of vendors that would highly\nbenefit from a decentralized marketplace like ours, especially when the\nmarketplace starts getting most of the more mainstream features in place, so\nthese will be targeted and definitely contacted when the marketplace will be\nable to accommodate their businesses.\n\nDo we have an estimated date for the hardfork and the beta release and will the\nbeta be testnet or mainnet?\nWe don’t have an estimated date for the hardfork that would move RingCT onto the\nmainnet branch. As many of you know, we planned on having one hardfork before\nthe end of the year, but Tecnovert, our Lead Particl Core Dev, has been working\non a variety of privacy-enhancing improvements and recommends we hold off on the\nhardfork until Bulletproofs, as well as the privacy-enhancing modifications, can\nbe included into the RingCT scheme we’ve had on testnet for over a year.\n\nRegarding the next stable marketplace release, the team is in the final run to\nmake a stable release of Alpha with governance and other features many of our\ntesters have been helping within the community since May. So instead of\nreleasing a Beta at the end of the year (2018), we’re terming the same product\nour Alpha v1.2 and it includes governance with coin weight. This 1.2 Alpha\nversion will be the last Alpha version we release, will be fully stable, and\nwill mark the beginning of the Beta stage of development.\n\nAdditionally, many of you will be happy to learn that, because of its stability,\nit will be able to ultimately run on Mainnet! To begin, we’ll release the stable\ntestnet builds to everyone and have a select and limited group of users running\nthe mainnet version. The mainnet version of Alpha will then be opened up to\neveryone!\n\nFollowing the Alpha v1.2 release of the Open Marketplace, the team will begin\nworking on a development branch of the code to focus on the next marketplace\nrelease — Beta. We shifted the timeline and terminology so that we could move\nour Alpha proof-of-concept to mainnet.\n\nBeta release isn’t nailed down to a specific date, but the team is shooting for\nMarch 2019 for a full Beta release to be ready. As always, this doesn’t\nconstitute a deadline but can give a general idea. In the meantime, leading up\nto that full release, the team will release regular Release Candidates that will\nfeature new tools for buyers and sellers. This is different than Alpha where the\nteam was focused on the base of the marketplace. Beta will be more focused on\npopping up features at a quicker pace and should be overall a more exciting\nstage of development for the community than Alpha was.\n\nYou can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well as\nParticl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on\nour blog.\n\nSouth Africa Team Meetings Update\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nAs you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa\nfrom the 16th of November to the 24th…\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11]\n\nWhen and how do you plan to do the second fundraising?\nThe team is going to begin taking a hands-off approach to funding questions. It\nis really not our place to comment on the funding plans of the Particl\nFoundation. Moving forward, we’ll volley all questions about the primary round\nto those board members, and are looking into setting up an AMA/FAQ session with\nthe Foundation itself.\n\nHow much time will be needed to release a mobile version of the marketplace and\nwhen can we expect a Particl Copay wallet on iOS?\nA mobile version of the marketplace is a future product, but we have zero input\nat this time as to how long that will take. That’s a team conversation to have\nwhen we’re all in the same location and have an open agenda when our current\ntasks near completion. What we can say is that a mobile version of the\nmarketplace is planned for development at some point in time in the future.\n\nInterview With Robert Edwards, Particl’s New Senior Developer\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75]\nOn the 2nd of December 2018, Particl hired a new senior developer, Robert\nEdwards. I’ve had the chance to have several…\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75]\n\nOn a related note, Particl Copay has a new senior developer\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75] \nbringing it up-to-date and adding more features, such as the ability to hold\nother coins on the wallet itself (i.e. Bitcoin). Another update to the mobile\nwallet will be to give the app cold staking abilities as well as a possible iOS\nintegration (currently being looked into).\n\nAre you going to release a roadmap with a timeline?\nWe’ll eventually release an update to the roadmap with the new work being\ndeveloped as future work. Just like our last roadmap, specific dates won’t be\nattached, but timeframes that coincide with development workloads and schedules\nwill be added when that information is available. We have no ETA on the release\nof a new roadmap for the moment.\n\nWhat kind of partnerships are you targeting and have you a plan to target\nmainstream users and nocoiners (except for Mubiz)?\nWithout a user-friendly way to access the marketplace, we really can’t target\nmainstream users. Some will be comfortable downloading a client, but a lot\nwon’t. Some vendors will be ok manually inputting inventory but many won’t. Some\nusers will be ok with pseudo-anonymous transactions, many won’t. With each new\nfeature we release, we get closer to our main goal of targeting regular online\nshoppers/sellers. This takes time and the team is still in the development phase\nof many of these features that mainstream users have come to expect. Mainstream\nusers and “nocoiners” are definitely a target audience as we believe\ndecentralized marketplaces to be a way of doing eCommerce that can benefit\nalmost anyone. Reaching the point when “nocoiners” start using decentralized\nmarketplaces will take time though, but we are confident we will get there.\n\nIt is also important to note that as Particl is being built as a fully trustless\nsolution, it is ultimately designed to be able to operate without any\nthird-party or partner. The well-functioning of the platform is not dependent on\nany partner.\n\nWhen is Particl Desktop going to be compatible with ledger?\nDesktop features are all taking a backseat to the marketplace as our team is\ncurrently fully focused on the last stretch. While the core wallet is currently\ncompatible with Ledger, the Particl Desktop integration will come at a later\ntime — possibly not until summer of 2019 or beyond.\n\nWhat is your marketing plan for 2019?\nSimilar to our social media strategy, we are creating parallel plans for Particl\nProject and Particl Marketplace. They’ll play together and sometimes go in\nslightly different ways, but each is tailored to their target audiences.\n\nWith the current market sentiment, one thing we’ve decided on was to not\nincrease our marketing spending immediately with Alpha coming to mainnet. We\nwill promote it, of course, but our experience has shown that even awesome news\ndoesn’t do much to grow the user base in this market, so we’ve decided to keep\nthe marketing budget as is in order to divert more funds towards development.\n\nTo that end, we’re making a conscious effort to get Particl at more events and\nmeetups. A boots on the ground strategy that directly relates to being one of\nthe only crypto projects to have a product — not still pitching dreams, is an\neffective way to network and get to meet key people that could assist the\nproject moving forward. Since the start of the bear market, most of the people\nthat were “in it just for the money” have left the space, and so the people that\nremain and actually go to conferences and events are people truly interested in\nthe tech, decentralization, and all the benefits blockchain can bring to the\nworld. These are the people we believe can help projects move forward, and so we\nare working towards making these real-life connections.\n\nSimilarly, with the bear market, most blockchain teams have been laying off\nemployees to survive under increasingly tight budgets. In the case of Particl\nthough, we’ve only been getting stronger and bigger this year, which we hope\nwill end up giving us a hedge in terms of real progress being made to our\nproducts.\n\nNote that this may change pretty quickly depending on various scenarios.\n\nAre we going to be added to a new big exchange soon?\nThis is something we, unfortunately, have very little control over. It’s\nentirely up to the exchanges we have working relationships with to list PART,\nbut we are constantly in contact with them as well as with our legal team to\nensure we have all the legal documentation that serious exchanges now require.\nWe strongly believe moving Alpha to mainnet will help us in getting recognized\nas a serious project, not “just another ICO promising stuff”. With all the noise\nand the ICO projects out there, leaving the group of projects that are “working\non something”, which is the greater majority of blockchain projects as it\ncurrently stands, and entering a much more limited group of projects with an\nactual live product will definitely help showcase all the efforts put into the\nproject and the talent of our developers.\n\nWhat are the other Dapps planned for Particl?\nThe team hasn’t officially planned out any future dapps for the moment. Each\nperson has their own ideas, but that’s a full team discussion yet to happen in a\nyet-to-be-determined location at a not-yet-planned time, sometime after the\nMarketplace push is finished. It’s important to note that the marketplace Dapp\nitself will be the main focus for the foreseeable future, although, with the\ndeveloper SDK as well as the Community Fund containing ~33k PART, we could start\nseeing new community developers get involved with the project and building their\nown Dapp. We also have some of our developers and team members have personal\n“dream Dapps” they would like to see on Particl, so, yes, definitely, there are\nsome thoughts being put into it, but the marketplace has to be the only focus\nfor now if we want it to release in a timely manner.\n\nAbout Particl.page [http://Particl.page], what is this website, what are\ntheir goals?\nParticl Page [https://particl.page]\nCommunity is at the heart of every project, crypto or otherwise. We want to\nstimulate a nice, friendly community around… [https://particl.page]particl.page\n[https://particl.page]\n\nIt’s an awesome community run website! They now have made a cold staking pool\navailable for their users, but as the website isn’t run by the team itself, we\ncannot say what other plans they have. They are somewhat active on Riot so don’t\nbe shy asking questions directly to them! (Riot user: @particl.page:matrix.org)\n\nDo we have other partners ready to handle the volatility of the escrow, the\ndouble deposits and which will allow mainstream users to pay in fiat using\nparticl in the background except for Mubiz? If it is not the case what is going\nto be done to have a worldwide coverage of partners ready to give Particl access\nto mainstream users?\nNothing as of yet. This type of problem needs to be addressed but, as with\neverything else, at the appropriate time. It’s a good question and a problem the\nteam is eager to solve when the time is right, which likely is going to be\nsometime after the marketplace push but probably before a mobile and web version\nof the marketplace is planned.\n\nDo you know if some distribution networks have been interested in doing their\ntrade on the Particl marketplace? If this is not the case, what is going to be\nmade to make them understand their benefits to use Particl? Any qualitative and\nquantitative studies about a private mad escrow on competitive gains have been\nmade already?\nNo studies have been performed by our team or outsourced to a third-party\nregarding MAD escrow usage as it relates to distribution networks. It’s a good\nstudy to have done if someone wants to lead it. We’d welcome any new involvement\nand can help in many ways with the right leadership in these types of analysis.\n\nI think you should rename “Private Markets” in “Confidential Markets”.\nWe’re actually leaning towards “Open Marketplace” for the main marketplace and\n“Bubbles”, which is interestingly popular within the community, for the private\nmarkets feature set. In that sense, the Open Marketplace can be seen as a large\nbubble surrounded by smaller bubbles. Both are private by design, but the\nprivate markets can be tailored to sub-communities, clients, or products. We’ll\nprobably continue testing names, so thanks for your suggestions. They are great\ntoo!\n\nAlbin has a plan to organize a Particl Hackathon in France you should contact\nhim about that.\nSponsoring Hackathons, especially ones focused on Particl SDK, is a home run\nanytime anyone wants to organize one. Scheduling it after the release of the\ndeveloper SDK makes the most sense though as participants would have access to\nthe whole array of development tools specifically made for building Dapps and\nmarketplace features on Particl.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis concludes the AMA/FAQ part of this Community Update.

They used this opportunity to record an AMA/FAQ session to answer some of the questions that have been <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/a0lbbf/amafaq_with_special_guest_lina_seiche_recording/\"><strong>asked on Reddit.</strong></a></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uiefPZl6IEw?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Due to limited time and the unusually high amount of questions received for this AMA/FAQ, the team couldn’t answer all the questions while in Toronto but did so in the Reddit thread itself. For the purpose of this Community Update, we’ve compiled all the answers, including those answered in the video.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Video Questions</strong></em></blockquote><h3 id=\"-3-01-can-we-expect-in-client-messaging-for-the-main-net\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=181\">3:01</a>) Can we expect in-client messaging for the main net?</h3><p>In-client messaging will be a new feature introduced into the marketplace as we work towards a fully loaded main release. We have a bunch of new features queued up on the development side, and when one of them gets ready for testing, it’ll be released as a new Release Candidate (RC). The release strategy for Beta will be different than during Alpha. Instead of working on several tasks at one, the team will start focusing on one feature at a time, allowing for more frequent and exciting Release Candidates. You can get a list of features being considered/worked on by reading the <a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa development update</strong></a> posted on our blog.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa Team Meetings Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><em>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa from the 16th of November to the 24th…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">particl.news</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--12---Part-1/1-o2H8JUZgcWaZkbjIHVRB9w.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Q&A Communications on Listing Pages</figcaption></figure><p>We do see in-client messaging integrated into the shopping experience in more ways than just buyer ←→ seller. One example of this can be seen in a <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1323\"><strong>gif posted on Github</strong></a> by our UI/UX and front-end developer, Martin Allien, that showed a way to communicate with a seller by asking questions (as well as see previous questions from other users) directly on the listing page. This is not unlike the popular Q&amp;A format used on Amazon and is a simple but useful communications tool providing value to buyers.</p><p>Another messaging mechanism we’d like to eventually implement would be group chats, most likely integrated into private markets (or Bubbles) and also as a stand-alone. This would provide more tools for people to form sub-communities, especially niche or trading internet communities (i.e. the now banned <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade\"><strong>/r/beertrade Reddit community</strong></a>) directly within Particl Desktop and not have to use different apps for communications. This would go a long way into making Particl even more present in your day-to-day life.</p><h3 id=\"-3-49-will-there-be-a-decentralized-exchange-integration\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=229\">3:49</a>) Will there be a Decentralized Exchange integration?</h3><p>The team hasn’t roadmapped or even met about creating a Particl DEX integration at this point in time. A lot of us in the community, as well as in the team, feel it’ll be a good complement to the marketplace so the idea definitely will get some discussion time at some point. Right now, we’re focused on marketplace integrations that usher in features that make our crypto-agnostic vision a reality. For this, we have several options we could leverage, including a Changelly or a similar third-party integration.</p><p>While a proper Particl-made DEX might not come at any point soon in time, it doesn’t mean we aren’t willing to integrate already existing DEX into the Particl platform. It may even be a more ideal path to follow, at least in the short-term, as volume is important on DEX, just like on any other exchange, and that integrating already popular solutions would help with kickstarting the volume.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--12---Part-1/1-inYbg2Q9ldZBYMTps_QZ6A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Example of How Atomic Swaps Could be Implemented (Stand-alone)</figcaption></figure><p>As such, we are actively looking at all the DEX projects being built within the space, and when one of them gets stable enough and fits our requirements to be integrated, then we might work toward making that a reality by first getting listed on there, and then integrating it into the platform. This, of course, would be something we’d keep the community in the know about any development on that front!</p><h3 id=\"-4-27-moving-forward-what-role-will-miguel-cuneta-and-john-bailon-play-in-particl\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=284\">(4:27</a>) Moving forward, what role will Miguel Cuneta and John Bailon play in Particl?</h3><p>All of our advisors are entrepreneurs and have many focuses, including Particl. Most of them are actual active community members, promoting Particl in their own circles, events, and towns. A good example of that can be seen in Miguel’s latest videos that have been posted on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnuttPuAY6AOenTz2GGMnbg\"><strong>our Youtube channel</strong></a> as well as in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-Jn41vwZd94\"><strong>Deutsche Welle’s documentary</strong></a> he and Lina Seiche were featured on last month.</p><p><strong>DW’s Documentary:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Jn41vwZd94?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><strong>Meeting Miguel Cuneta, Particl Advisor:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PQaZbqHl6ug?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><strong>Humans of Crypto, Episode 1 — Miguel Cuneta:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ItLTZ3-6fes?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>To date, we haven’t necessarily engaged all of our advisors very much with agendas as we’ve been in the middle of a heavy development phase. Beginning in 2019, <strong>as we release Beta and Alpha mainnet</strong>, we’ll definitely be engaging each of our advisors more, having regular strategy meetings, more promotions on social media, and just overall leveraging their business abilities more. 2019 will be a very different year for the Particl project, especially as we enter a production phase, and so the team will have different focuses where our advisors will be of tremendous help.</p><p>With Lina being stationed in the Philippines, we’ve already started to engage more with our advisors from <a href=\"http://sci.ph\"><strong>SCI</strong></a>, Miguel Cuneta and John Bailon, and you can expect them to be even more visible and involved this year.</p><h3 id=\"-6-22-can-we-expect-a-fiat-gateway-integration-into-the-particl-client\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=382\">6:22</a>) Can we expect a fiat gateway integration into the Particl client?</h3><p>We know that in order to reach some levels of mainstream adoption which is, after all, a goal of the project, there needs to be as many payment options as possible. Accepting many cryptocurrencies is definitely a good way to achieve this, and this is one of the features that are likely to be implemented in one of our Beta release candidate, but also accepting more traditional forms of payment is a huge leap forward for the platform to be used by a more mainstream type of audience. This is the reason why fiat gateways</p><p>We need to find the right fit that doesn’t compromise Particl’s core values. We have looked at services that have fiat gateways and PART already, such as IndaCoin, but so far haven’t found one that meets the project’s standards of privacy and security.</p><p>For the time being, we know <a href=\"https://mubiz.com/\">Mubiz</a> plans on tackling that aspect for buyers, albeit for a fee, so definitely keep your eyes on them!</p><h3 id=\"-7-34-does-the-recent-sec-ruling-affect-particl-in-any-material-way\">(7:34) Does the recent SEC ruling affect Particl in any material way?</h3><p>Our legal team keeps us on the path that is straight and narrow. Regulations are constantly changing and the key to complying with current and future laws is to play by the rules from the beginning. As such, we are confident that we are fully compliant with any current regulation and are constantly having our legal team stay ahead of the curve and in the know of any change in regulations. Compliance and “doing it right” is a major focus of the project, and we fully intend on staying that way moving forward.</p><h3 id=\"-8-23-how-will-atomic-swaps-be-incorporated-into-particl-on-a-user-interface-level\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=503\">8:23</a>) How will atomic swaps be incorporated into Particl on a user interface-level?</h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">You can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well as Particl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on our blog.</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--12---Part-1/1-QYyJvxwo2VnPZf-a9qCOjA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Example of a Possible Atomic Swap Implementation (Stand-alone)</figcaption></figure><p>There are mostly two UI/UX implementations we are looking into for Particl Desktop. Having atomic swaps be incorporated as part of the checkout process of the marketplace is one path. Another parallel path is having an atomic swaps dapp that is independent of the marketplace and acts as a p2p, private decentralized exchange. An implementation like this would also be very useful for future Particl Dapps since it would live independently of the marketplace.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">You can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well as Particl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on our blog.</a></p><h3 id=\"-9-05-what-does-lina-consider-to-be-the-most-exciting-aspect-about-particl\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=545\">9:05</a>) What does Lina consider to be the most exciting aspect about Particl?</h3><p><strong>Paraphrased from Lina:</strong></p><blockquote>I’m still learning every day about the project, but one of the most exciting things I find about Particl is that it is a “no non-sense project”. This is obviously something the community appreciates as well, and when you get acquainted with the team, you understand that they are really not here for the hype, or the buzzwords, or the money. They have actually been around for a while and they all work out of conviction/ideology. I believe this project is here to push good values and useful technologies like privacy and security into the cryptocurrency space.I also like that Particl does things differently from other projects, being focused on development instead of hype and promises. It is one of the few projects that have made the jump from being purely a concept to an actual product that can be shown and demoed. In the end, we can talk about revolution all we like, but unless we deliver results, we’ll always be stuck in this bad position that you have nothing that can be used, only concepts, and you find yourself with very little adoption. Particl is pioneering and delivering, and that’s very exciting to see. If next week you ask me how excited I am about the project, then I would probably tell you that I am even more excited!<br></blockquote><p><strong>Paraphrased from Paul:</strong></p><blockquote>Just to add on what Lina is saying, we’re here today in Toronto for demoing Particl Marketplace in a demo-focused event. We realize however that we are pretty much one of the only projects in the space with a properly working product, although currently only on testnet. Most projects in the space are still stuck on sales pitches, and I want to give props to our developers for their talent and passion making all of this a reality. We were very well received in Toronto and it was cool to show off how to people a working blockchain product.</blockquote><h3 id=\"-11-58-can-you-give-us-a-brief-summary-of-your-week-in-south-africa\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=718\">11:58</a>) Can you give us a brief summary of your week in South Africa?</h3><p>We have made a dedicated blog post about all the details of the South Africa development meeting. You can read it by clicking on the following link:</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa Team Meetings Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><em>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa from the 16th of November to the 24th…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">particl.news</a></p><p>Aside from all the features the team has decided to explore for Beta, a lot of the meetings were about discussing ways the whole development process could be improved.</p><p>Among the couple of tweaks made to it, one of them was the new release strategy for Beta. Basically, the development of the marketplace will now be split into two branches: dev and stable. The <em>dev</em> branch will be the “experimental” one where new features will first be released on testnet. New features can break stuff, and having a broken build when you want to show it to people is not very helpful and can even be counter-productive. That’s where a <em>stable</em> branch comes in handy. This branch only gets new features added to it once they have been properly tested and fully debugged, making much more stable for demonstration and testing purposes.</p><p>Additionally, the release strategy will now be different than how it was during Alpha. Instead of focusing on several features and functions at the same time, each development team will now focus on mostly one feature at a time, ensuring more frequent and exciting releases. Each of these Release Candidates will bring for testing new features, such as various messaging mechanisms, reputation, privacy, gateways, inventory management, and more. As Alpha was all about developing the base layer for the marketplace, Beta will be about adding new features, starting with the most necessary ones. These features will be able to be added at a much faster pace than before, and so we expect the Beta phase of development to be very exciting for everyone!</p><p>We’ve also decided that, parallel to the two testnet branches, we’d also <strong>finally release Particl Marketplace Alpha on mainnet</strong>. We’re currently in the last mile before our first mainnet marketplace release which will mark a glorious milestone for the project. The team is currently entirely focused on making the current Alpha build fully stable, and is making the final touches before it goes live on mainnet. New features will start being developed only after the Alpha version of the marketplace is pushed onto mainnet.</p><p>Another topic discussed in Africa and not necessarily related to development was our decision to start attending more events, do more meetups, sponsorships, and boots-on-the-ground campaigns. Directly related to that is the announcement we’ve made in December that we’d be attending <strong>Asia Crypto Week’s flagship event, TOKEN2049</strong>.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b\"><strong>Particl is Going to Hong Kong’s TOKEN 2049 Conference</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b\"><em>Directly in line with our “boots-on-the-ground” intention of being present at more conferences around the world…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b\">particl.news</a></p><h3 id=\"-15-01-is-there-going-to-be-a-meetup-in-france\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=901\">15:01</a>) Is there going to be a meetup in France?</h3><p>Yes, we are in the middle of preparing an event we’ll be presenting at Paris’ <a href=\"https://www.coinhouse.com/\"><strong>CoinHouse</strong></a> late in February. <a href=\"https://business.lesechos.fr/entrepreneurs/idees-de-business/0600016133318-coinhouse-le-grand-magasin-du-bitcoin-324430.php\"><strong>CoinHouse is the leading Bitcoin and cryptocurrency hub in France</strong></a> with over 100,000 customers, 35,000 of them being considered as “active”. It offers a wide array of services including educational information, <a href=\"https://www.capital.fr/entreprises-marches/bitcoin-coinhouse-peut-desormais-faire-du-conseil-en-investissement-1305686\"><strong>investment advice</strong></a><strong> </strong>(approved by France’s AMF), OTC Bitcoin purchases and sales, and more. As part of their educational mission and community-driven initiatives, they hold very popular meetups, conferences, and other types of events that can be attended by the France cryptocurrency community. The startup has also been the home of the now widely-known and popular startup <a href=\"http://ledger.com\"><strong>Ledger</strong></a>, which now have a product (Ledger Nano S) that is <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae\"><strong>compatible with Particl for hardware storage and cold staking</strong></a>. CoinHouse is also partnered with renowned Paris Universities <a href=\"http://www.hec.edu/\"><strong>HEC</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.polytechnique.edu/\"><strong>Polytechnique</strong></a><strong> </strong>and now offers blockchain classes to students.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d\"><strong>La Maison du Bitcoin Rebrands as Coinhouse</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d\"><em>Leading cryptoasset investment with new platform, services and visual identity</em></a><a href=\"https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d\">medium.com</a></p><p>This event is very likely to include several presentations from not only team members, but also from both community members Ben and Albin Cauderlier from Mubiz.

We are looking into several ways to increase awareness and it may make a comeback at some point in time, although under a different and improved form, but it is not a short-term goal.</p><h3 id=\"-17-44-will-there-be-a-coin-weight-feature-enabling-large-holders-to-easily-remove-products-e-g-those-of-a-competitor-from-the-market\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1064\">17:44</a>) Will there be a coin weight feature enabling large holders to easily remove products (e.g. those of a competitor) from the market?</h3><p>It shouldn’t be possible to do but never say never. The development of governance with coin weight is now finished and the mechanism is undergoing several rounds of tests. This feature will be on the next stable Alpha release and part of the first mainnet version of the marketplace. Moving the initial governance system onto mainnet is the best way to see how it holds up against abuse when real funds are on the line. Our team will constantly be monitoring how the first mainnet governance system holds up in real-life and will be ready to make any improvement deemed necessary, if any. Being among the first, if not the first, at building a truly decentralized governance model of an eCommerce is a hell of a task with very few prior examples to refer to. The first mainnet model perhaps won’t be perfect, but we have to start somewhere and then improve as we go. This, after all, is the mentality of pioneers!</p><h3 id=\"-18-32-what-added-value-could-sci-provide-for-particl\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1112\">18:32</a>)— What added value could SCI provide for Particl?</h3><p>Similarly to the previous question about our advisors, we intend on leveraging the founders of SCI, Miguel Cuneta and John Bailon, good friends to the project, much more starting this year. As we shift towards a different stage of the project, one that is likely to be much more business-minded than last year, their expertise and network could become very handy.</p><p><a href=\"https://sci.ph/\"><strong>SCI - Home</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://sci.ph/\"><em>Satoshi Citadel Industries (Bitmarket.ph Inc.) is a financial technology company building the Blockchain ecosystem in…</em></a><a href=\"https://sci.ph/\">sci.ph</a></p><p>Satoshi Citadel Industries is one of the first and biggest blockchain companies in the Philippines.

The community will begin seeing more video shorts, graphic eye candy and other treats on Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram in 2019.</p><p>Both Particl the platform and Particl Open Marketplace will have their own social calendars and marketing missions that are independent and play off of each other. Even though at this moment the target audiences of both items are cryptocurrency users, we see the marketplace veering off into more mainstream online buyers and sellers as the year goes by and our products get the necessary features required to appeal to a more mainstream target audience.</p><h3 id=\"what-about-the-vendor-outreach-and-recruitment-strategy-has-this-been-developed-and-if-so-how-will-it-be-implemented-and-what-can-we-expect\"><em>What about the vendor outreach and recruitment strategy? Has this been developed and if so how will it be implemented and what can we expect?</em></h3><p>Large-scale vendor recruitment won’t come until after a full Beta release containing all the planned features that define that release. It could even be later than that, after we integrate more features, especially as it relates to more “mainstream”, non-geeky vendors. The reason for an even later date than Beta to begin recruitment of more mainstream vendors is that they are used to work on web pages and/or mobile apps. Being a downloadable marketplace keeps our adoption rate low until our mobile/web interfaces are developed but rest assured, these are absolutely planned.</p><p>For this reason, we expect some of the first vendors to be those operating in niche industries, vendors facing difficulties with payment processors and/or certain regulations, as well as people looking into acquiring cryptocurrencies. In other words, as the first mainnet versions of the marketplace might be more limited in terms of features, the first vendors are likely to be those suffering the most from the centralized infrastructure of online eCommerce and that will benefit the most from the perks offered by decentralization (barely any fee, censorship-proof, privacy, etc).</p><p>As Beta Release Candidates start to be released, each of them will contain new features that are likely to grow the target audience each time they get added. Whether it be messages, improved privacy, inventory management, or reputation, each new feature makes the marketplace more attractive and user-friendly to a wider audience.</p><p>We already have a pretty good idea of the types of vendors that would highly benefit from a decentralized marketplace like ours, especially when the marketplace starts getting most of the more mainstream features in place, so these will be targeted and definitely contacted when the marketplace will be able to accommodate their businesses.</p><h3 id=\"do-we-have-an-estimated-date-for-the-hardfork-and-the-beta-release-and-will-the-beta-be-testnet-or-mainnet\">Do we have an estimated date for the hardfork and the beta release and will the beta be testnet or mainnet?</h3><p>We don’t have an estimated date for the hardfork that would move RingCT onto the mainnet branch. As many of you know, we planned on having one hardfork before the end of the year, but Tecnovert, our Lead Particl Core Dev, has been working on a variety of privacy-enhancing improvements and recommends we hold off on the hardfork until Bulletproofs, as well as the privacy-enhancing modifications, can be included into the RingCT scheme we’ve had on testnet for over a year.</p><p>Regarding the next stable marketplace release, the team is in the final run to make a stable release of Alpha with governance and other features many of our testers have been helping within the community since May. So instead of releasing a Beta at the end of the year (2018), we’re terming the same product our Alpha v1.2 and it includes governance with coin weight. This 1.2 Alpha version will be the last Alpha version we release, will be fully stable, and will mark the beginning of the Beta stage of development.</p><p>Additionally, many of you will be happy to learn that, because of its stability, it will be able to ultimately run on Mainnet! To begin, we’ll release the stable testnet builds to everyone and have a select <strong>and limited</strong> group of users running the mainnet version. The mainnet version of Alpha will then be opened up to everyone!</p><p>Following the Alpha v1.2 release of the Open Marketplace, the team will begin working on a development branch of the code to focus on the next marketplace release — Beta. We shifted the timeline and terminology so that we could move our Alpha proof-of-concept to mainnet.</p><p>Beta release isn’t nailed down to a specific date, but the team is shooting for March 2019 for a full Beta release to be ready. As always, this doesn’t constitute a deadline but can give a general idea. In the meantime, leading up to that full release, the team will release regular Release Candidates that will feature new tools for buyers and sellers. This is different than Alpha where the team was focused on the base of the marketplace. Beta will be more focused on popping up features at a quicker pace and should be overall a more exciting stage of development for the community than Alpha was.</p><p>You can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well as Particl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on our blog.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa Team Meetings Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><em>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa from the 16th of November to the 24th…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">particl.news</a></p><h3 id=\"when-and-how-do-you-plan-to-do-the-second-fundraising\"><em>When and how do you plan to do the second fundraising?</em></h3><p>The team is going to begin taking a hands-off approach to funding questions. It is really not our place to comment on the funding plans of the Particl Foundation. Moving forward, we’ll volley all questions about the primary round to those board members, and are looking into setting up an AMA/FAQ session with the Foundation itself.</p><h3 id=\"how-much-time-will-be-needed-to-release-a-mobile-version-of-the-marketplace-and-when-can-we-expect-a-particl-copay-wallet-on-ios\"><em>How much time will be needed to release a mobile version of the marketplace and when can we expect a Particl Copay wallet on iOS?</em></h3><p>A mobile version of the marketplace is a future product, but we have zero input at this time as to how long that will take. That’s a team conversation to have when we’re all in the same location and have an open agenda when our current tasks near completion. What we can say is that a mobile version of the marketplace is planned for development at some point in time in the future.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75\"><strong>Interview With Robert Edwards, Particl’s New Senior Developer</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75\"><em>On the 2nd of December 2018, Particl hired a new senior developer, Robert Edwards.

Another update to the mobile wallet will be to give the app cold staking abilities as well as a possible iOS integration (currently being looked into).</p><h3 id=\"are-you-going-to-release-a-roadmap-with-a-timeline\"><em>Are you going to release a roadmap with a timeline?</em></h3><p>We’ll eventually release an update to the roadmap with the new work being developed as future work. Just like our last roadmap, specific dates won’t be attached, but timeframes that coincide with development workloads and schedules will be added when that information is available. We have no ETA on the release of a new roadmap for the moment.</p><h3 id=\"what-kind-of-partnerships-are-you-targeting-and-have-you-a-plan-to-target-mainstream-users-and-nocoiners-except-for-mubiz-\"><em>What kind of partnerships are you targeting and have you a plan to target mainstream users and nocoiners (except for Mubiz)?</em></h3><p>Without a user-friendly way to access the marketplace, we really can’t target mainstream users. Some will be comfortable downloading a client, but a lot won’t. Some vendors will be ok manually inputting inventory but many won’t. Some users will be ok with pseudo-anonymous transactions, many won’t. With each new feature we release, we get closer to our main goal of targeting regular online shoppers/sellers. This takes time and the team is still in the development phase of many of these features that mainstream users have come to expect. Mainstream users and “nocoiners” are definitely a target audience as we believe decentralized marketplaces to be a way of doing eCommerce that can benefit almost anyone. Reaching the point when “nocoiners” start using decentralized marketplaces will take time though, but we are confident we will get there.</p><p>It is also important to note that as Particl is being built as a fully trustless solution, it is ultimately designed to be able to operate without any third-party or partner. The well-functioning of the platform is not dependent on any partner.</p><h3 id=\"when-is-particl-desktop-going-to-be-compatible-with-ledger\"><em>When is Particl Desktop going to be compatible with ledger?</em></h3><p>Desktop features are all taking a backseat to the marketplace as our team is currently fully focused on the last stretch. While the core wallet is currently compatible with Ledger, the Particl Desktop integration will come at a later time — possibly not until summer of 2019 or beyond.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-your-marketing-plan-for-2019\"><em>What is your marketing plan for 2019?</em></h3><p>Similar to our social media strategy, we are creating parallel plans for Particl Project and Particl Marketplace. They’ll play together and sometimes go in slightly different ways, but each is tailored to their target audiences.</p><p>With the current market sentiment, one thing we’ve decided on was to not increase our marketing spending immediately with Alpha coming to mainnet. We will promote it, of course, but our experience has shown that even awesome news doesn’t do much to grow the user base in this market, so we’ve decided to keep the marketing budget as is in order to divert more funds towards development.</p><p>To that end, we’re making a conscious effort to get Particl at more events and meetups. A boots on the ground strategy that directly relates to being one of the only crypto projects to have a product — not still pitching dreams, is an effective way to network and get to meet key people that could assist the project moving forward. Since the start of the bear market, most of the people that were “in it just for the money” have left the space, and so the people that remain and actually go to conferences and events are people truly interested in the tech, decentralization, and all the benefits blockchain can bring to the world. These are the people we believe can help projects move forward, and so we are working towards making these real-life connections.</p><p>Similarly, with the bear market, most blockchain teams have been laying off employees to survive under increasingly tight budgets. In the case of Particl though, we’ve only been getting stronger and bigger this year, which we hope will end up giving us a hedge in terms of real progress being made to our products.</p><p>Note that this may change pretty quickly depending on various scenarios.</p><h3 id=\"are-we-going-to-be-added-to-a-new-big-exchange-soon\"><em>Are we going to be added to a new big exchange soon?</em></h3><p>This is something we, unfortunately, have very little control over. It’s entirely up to the exchanges we have working relationships with to list PART, but we are constantly in contact with them as well as with our legal team to ensure we have all the legal documentation that serious exchanges now require. We strongly believe moving Alpha to mainnet will help us in getting recognized as a serious project, not “just another ICO promising stuff”. With all the noise and the ICO projects out there, leaving the group of projects that are “working on something”, which is the greater majority of blockchain projects as it currently stands, and entering a much more limited group of projects with an actual live product will definitely help showcase all the efforts put into the project and the talent of our developers.</p><h3 id=\"what-are-the-other-dapps-planned-for-particl\"><em>What are the other Dapps planned for Particl?</em></h3><p>The team hasn’t officially planned out any future dapps for the moment. Each person has their own ideas, but that’s a full team discussion yet to happen in a yet-to-be-determined location at a not-yet-planned time, sometime after the Marketplace push is finished. It’s important to note that the marketplace Dapp itself will be the main focus for the foreseeable future, although, with the developer SDK as well as the Community Fund containing ~33k PART, we could start seeing new community developers get involved with the project and building their own Dapp. We also have some of our developers and team members have personal “dream Dapps” they would like to see on Particl, so, yes, definitely, there are some thoughts being put into it, but the marketplace has to be the only focus for now if we want it to release in a timely manner.</p><h3 id=\"about-particl-page-what-is-this-website-what-are-their-goals\"><em>About </em><a href=\"http://Particl.page\"><em>Particl.page</em></a><em>, what is this website, what are their goals?</em></h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.page\"><strong>Particl Page</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.page\"><em>Community is at the heart of every project, crypto or otherwise.

This type of problem needs to be addressed but, as with everything else, at the appropriate time. It’s a good question and a problem the team is eager to solve when the time is right, which likely is going to be sometime after the marketplace push but probably before a mobile and web version of the marketplace is planned.</p><h3 id=\"do-you-know-if-some-distribution-networks-have-been-interested-in-doing-their-trade-on-the-particl-marketplace-if-this-is-not-the-case-what-is-going-to-be-made-to-make-them-understand-their-benefits-to-use-particl-any-qualitative-and-quantitative-studies-about-a-private-mad-escrow-on-competitive-gains-have-been-made-already\"><em>Do you know if some distribution networks have been interested in doing their trade on the Particl marketplace?

It’s a good study to have done if someone wants to lead it. We’d welcome any new involvement and can help in many ways with the right leadership in these types of analysis.</p><h3 id=\"i-think-you-should-rename-private-markets-in-confidential-markets-\"><em>I think you should rename “Private Markets” in “Confidential Markets”.</em></h3><p>We’re actually leaning towards “Open Marketplace” for the main marketplace and “Bubbles”, which is interestingly popular within the community, for the private markets feature set. In that sense, the Open Marketplace can be seen as a large bubble surrounded by smaller bubbles. Both are private by design, but the private markets can be tailored to sub-communities, clients, or products. We’ll probably continue testing names, so thanks for your suggestions. They are great too!</p><h3 id=\"albin-has-a-plan-to-organize-a-particl-hackathon-in-france-you-should-contact-him-about-that-\"><em>Albin has a plan to organize a Particl Hackathon in France you should contact him about that.</em></h3><p>Sponsoring Hackathons, especially ones focused on Particl SDK, is a home run anytime anyone wants to organize one. Scheduling it after the release of the developer SDK makes the most sense though as participants would have access to the whole array of development tools specifically made for building Dapps and marketplace features on Particl.</p><hr><p>This concludes the AMA/FAQ part of this Community Update.

We have a bunch of new features queued up on the development side, and when one of them gets ready for testing, it’ll be released as a new Release Candidate (RC). The release strategy for Beta will be different than during Alpha. Instead of working on several tasks at one, the team will start focusing on one feature at a time, allowing for more frequent and exciting Release Candidates. You can get a list of features being considered/worked on by reading the <a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa development update</strong></a> posted on our blog.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa Team Meetings Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><em>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa from the 16th of November to the 24th…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">particl.news</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--12---Part-1/1-o2H8JUZgcWaZkbjIHVRB9w.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Q&#x26;A Communications on Listing Pages</figcaption></figure><p>We do see in-client messaging integrated into the shopping experience in more ways than just buyer ←→ seller. One example of this can be seen in a <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1323\"><strong>gif posted on Github</strong></a> by our UI/UX and front-end developer, Martin Allien, that showed a way to communicate with a seller by asking questions (as well as see previous questions from other users) directly on the listing page. This is not unlike the popular Q&#x26;A format used on Amazon and is a simple but useful communications tool providing value to buyers.</p><p>Another messaging mechanism we’d like to eventually implement would be group chats, most likely integrated into private markets (or Bubbles) and also as a stand-alone. This would provide more tools for people to form sub-communities, especially niche or trading internet communities (i.e. the now banned <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade\"><strong>/r/beertrade Reddit community</strong></a>) directly within Particl Desktop and not have to use different apps for communications.

A lot of us in the community, as well as in the team, feel it’ll be a good complement to the marketplace so the idea definitely will get some discussion time at some point. Right now, we’re focused on marketplace integrations that usher in features that make our crypto-agnostic vision a reality. For this, we have several options we could leverage, including a Changelly or a similar third-party integration.</p><p>While a proper Particl-made DEX might not come at any point soon in time, it doesn’t mean we aren’t willing to integrate already existing DEX into the Particl platform. It may even be a more ideal path to follow, at least in the short-term, as volume is important on DEX, just like on any other exchange, and that integrating already popular solutions would help with kickstarting the volume.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--12---Part-1/1-inYbg2Q9ldZBYMTps_QZ6A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Example of How Atomic Swaps Could be Implemented (Stand-alone)</figcaption></figure><p>As such, we are actively looking at all the DEX projects being built within the space, and when one of them gets stable enough and fits our requirements to be integrated, then we might work toward making that a reality by first getting listed on there, and then integrating it into the platform.

A good example of that can be seen in Miguel’s latest videos that have been posted on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnuttPuAY6AOenTz2GGMnbg\"><strong>our Youtube channel</strong></a> as well as in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-Jn41vwZd94\"><strong>Deutsche Welle’s documentary</strong></a> he and Lina Seiche were featured on last month.</p><p><strong>DW’s Documentary:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Jn41vwZd94?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><strong>Meeting Miguel Cuneta, Particl Advisor:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PQaZbqHl6ug?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><strong>Humans of Crypto, Episode 1 — Miguel Cuneta:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ItLTZ3-6fes?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>To date, we haven’t necessarily engaged all of our advisors very much with agendas as we’ve been in the middle of a heavy development phase. Beginning in 2019, <strong>as we release Beta and Alpha mainnet</strong>, we’ll definitely be engaging each of our advisors more, having regular strategy meetings, more promotions on social media, and just overall leveraging their business abilities more. 2019 will be a very different year for the Particl project, especially as we enter a production phase, and so the team will have different focuses where our advisors will be of tremendous help.</p><p>With Lina being stationed in the Philippines, we’ve already started to engage more with our advisors from <a href=\"http://sci.ph\"><strong>SCI</strong></a>, Miguel Cuneta and John Bailon, and you can expect them to be even more visible and involved this year.</p><h3 id=\"-6-22-can-we-expect-a-fiat-gateway-integration-into-the-particl-client\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=382\">6:22</a>) Can we expect a fiat gateway integration into the Particl client?</h3><p>We know that in order to reach some levels of mainstream adoption which is, after all, a goal of the project, there needs to be as many payment options as possible. Accepting many cryptocurrencies is definitely a good way to achieve this, and this is one of the features that are likely to be implemented in one of our Beta release candidate, but also accepting more traditional forms of payment is a huge leap forward for the platform to be used by a more mainstream type of audience. This is the reason why fiat gateways</p><p>We need to find the right fit that doesn’t compromise Particl’s core values. We have looked at services that have fiat gateways and PART already, such as IndaCoin, but so far haven’t found one that meets the project’s standards of privacy and security.</p><p>For the time being, we know <a href=\"https://mubiz.com/\">Mubiz</a> plans on tackling that aspect for buyers, albeit for a fee, so definitely keep your eyes on them!</p><h3 id=\"-7-34-does-the-recent-sec-ruling-affect-particl-in-any-material-way\">(7:34) Does the recent SEC ruling affect Particl in any material way?</h3><p>Our legal team keeps us on the path that is straight and narrow. Regulations are constantly changing and the key to complying with current and future laws is to play by the rules from the beginning. As such, we are confident that we are fully compliant with any current regulation and are constantly having our legal team stay ahead of the curve and in the know of any change in regulations. Compliance and “doing it right” is a major focus of the project, and we fully intend on staying that way moving forward.</p><h3 id=\"-8-23-how-will-atomic-swaps-be-incorporated-into-particl-on-a-user-interface-level\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=503\">8:23</a>) How will atomic swaps be incorporated into Particl on a user interface-level?</h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">You can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well as Particl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on our blog.</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--12---Part-1/1-QYyJvxwo2VnPZf-a9qCOjA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Example of a Possible Atomic Swap Implementation (Stand-alone)</figcaption></figure><p>There are mostly two UI/UX implementations we are looking into for Particl Desktop. Having atomic swaps be incorporated as part of the checkout process of the marketplace is one path. Another parallel path is having an atomic swaps dapp that is independent of the marketplace and acts as a p2p, private decentralized exchange. An implementation like this would also be very useful for future Particl Dapps since it would live independently of the marketplace.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">You can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well as Particl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on our blog.</a></p><h3 id=\"-9-05-what-does-lina-consider-to-be-the-most-exciting-aspect-about-particl\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=545\">9:05</a>) What does Lina consider to be the most exciting aspect about Particl?</h3><p><strong>Paraphrased from Lina:</strong></p><blockquote>I’m still learning every day about the project, but one of the most exciting things I find about Particl is that it is a “no non-sense project”. This is obviously something the community appreciates as well, and when you get acquainted with the team, you understand that they are really not here for the hype, or the buzzwords, or the money. They have actually been around for a while and they all work out of conviction/ideology. I believe this project is here to push good values and useful technologies like privacy and security into the cryptocurrency space.I also like that Particl does things differently from other projects, being focused on development instead of hype and promises. It is one of the few projects that have made the jump from being purely a concept to an actual product that can be shown and demoed. In the end, we can talk about revolution all we like, but unless we deliver results, we’ll always be stuck in this bad position that you have nothing that can be used, only concepts, and you find yourself with very little adoption. Particl is pioneering and delivering, and that’s very exciting to see. If next week you ask me how excited I am about the project, then I would probably tell you that I am even more excited!<br></blockquote><p><strong>Paraphrased from Paul:</strong></p><blockquote>Just to add on what Lina is saying, we’re here today in Toronto for demoing Particl Marketplace in a demo-focused event. We realize however that we are pretty much one of the only projects in the space with a properly working product, although currently only on testnet. Most projects in the space are still stuck on sales pitches, and I want to give props to our developers for their talent and passion making all of this a reality. We were very well received in Toronto and it was cool to show off how to people a working blockchain product.</blockquote><h3 id=\"-11-58-can-you-give-us-a-brief-summary-of-your-week-in-south-africa\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=718\">11:58</a>) Can you give us a brief summary of your week in South Africa?</h3><p>We have made a dedicated blog post about all the details of the South Africa development meeting. You can read it by clicking on the following link:</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa Team Meetings Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><em>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa from the 16th of November to the 24th…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">particl.news</a></p><p>Aside from all the features the team has decided to explore for Beta, a lot of the meetings were about discussing ways the whole development process could be improved.</p><p>Among the couple of tweaks made to it, one of them was the new release strategy for Beta. Basically, the development of the marketplace will now be split into two branches: dev and stable. The <em>dev</em> branch will be the “experimental” one where new features will first be released on testnet. New features can break stuff, and having a broken build when you want to show it to people is not very helpful and can even be counter-productive. That’s where a <em>stable</em> branch comes in handy. This branch only gets new features added to it once they have been properly tested and fully debugged, making much more stable for demonstration and testing purposes.</p><p>Additionally, the release strategy will now be different than how it was during Alpha. Instead of focusing on several features and functions at the same time, each development team will now focus on mostly one feature at a time, ensuring more frequent and exciting releases. Each of these Release Candidates will bring for testing new features, such as various messaging mechanisms, reputation, privacy, gateways, inventory management, and more. As Alpha was all about developing the base layer for the marketplace, Beta will be about adding new features, starting with the most necessary ones. These features will be able to be added at a much faster pace than before, and so we expect the Beta phase of development to be very exciting for everyone!</p><p>We’ve also decided that, parallel to the two testnet branches, we’d also <strong>finally release Particl Marketplace Alpha on mainnet</strong>. We’re currently in the last mile before our first mainnet marketplace release which will mark a glorious milestone for the project. The team is currently entirely focused on making the current Alpha build fully stable, and is making the final touches before it goes live on mainnet. New features will start being developed only after the Alpha version of the marketplace is pushed onto mainnet.</p><p>Another topic discussed in Africa and not necessarily related to development was our decision to start attending more events, do more meetups, sponsorships, and boots-on-the-ground campaigns. Directly related to that is the announcement we’ve made in December that we’d be attending <strong>Asia Crypto Week’s flagship event, TOKEN2049</strong>.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b\"><strong>Particl is Going to Hong Kong’s TOKEN 2049 Conference</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b\"><em>Directly in line with our “boots-on-the-ground” intention of being present at more conferences around the world…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b\">particl.news</a></p><h3 id=\"-15-01-is-there-going-to-be-a-meetup-in-france\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=901\">15:01</a>) Is there going to be a meetup in France?</h3><p>Yes, we are in the middle of preparing an event we’ll be presenting at Paris’ <a href=\"https://www.coinhouse.com/\"><strong>CoinHouse</strong></a> late in February. <a href=\"https://business.lesechos.fr/entrepreneurs/idees-de-business/0600016133318-coinhouse-le-grand-magasin-du-bitcoin-324430.php\"><strong>CoinHouse is the leading Bitcoin and cryptocurrency hub in France</strong></a> with over 100,000 customers, 35,000 of them being considered as “active”. It offers a wide array of services including educational information, <a href=\"https://www.capital.fr/entreprises-marches/bitcoin-coinhouse-peut-desormais-faire-du-conseil-en-investissement-1305686\"><strong>investment advice</strong></a><strong> </strong>(approved by France’s AMF), OTC Bitcoin purchases and sales, and more. As part of their educational mission and community-driven initiatives, they hold very popular meetups, conferences, and other types of events that can be attended by the France cryptocurrency community. The startup has also been the home of the now widely-known and popular startup <a href=\"http://ledger.com\"><strong>Ledger</strong></a>, which now have a product (Ledger Nano S) that is <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae\"><strong>compatible with Particl for hardware storage and cold staking</strong></a>. CoinHouse is also partnered with renowned Paris Universities <a href=\"http://www.hec.edu/\"><strong>HEC</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.polytechnique.edu/\"><strong>Polytechnique</strong></a><strong> </strong>and now offers blockchain classes to students.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d\"><strong>La Maison du Bitcoin Rebrands as Coinhouse</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d\"><em>Leading cryptoasset investment with new platform, services and visual identity</em></a><a href=\"https://medium.com/coinhouse/la-maison-du-bitcoin-rebrands-as-coinhouse-7d56a2a9a88d\">medium.com</a></p><p>This event is very likely to include several presentations from not only team members, but also from both community members Ben and Albin Cauderlier from Mubiz. More information about this event will follow in the next few days.</p><h3 id=\"-16-52-will-there-be-another-partaker-hub\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1012\">16:52</a>) Will there be another PARTaker Hub?</h3><p>We have no immediate plan for rebooting the Partaker Hub. We are looking into several ways to increase awareness and it may make a comeback at some point in time, although under a different and improved form, but it is not a short-term goal.</p><h3 id=\"-17-44-will-there-be-a-coin-weight-feature-enabling-large-holders-to-easily-remove-products-e-g-those-of-a-competitor-from-the-market\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1064\">17:44</a>) Will there be a coin weight feature enabling large holders to easily remove products (e.g. those of a competitor) from the market?</h3><p>It shouldn’t be possible to do but never say never. The development of governance with coin weight is now finished and the mechanism is undergoing several rounds of tests. This feature will be on the next stable Alpha release and part of the first mainnet version of the marketplace. Moving the initial governance system onto mainnet is the best way to see how it holds up against abuse when real funds are on the line. Our team will constantly be monitoring how the first mainnet governance system holds up in real-life and will be ready to make any improvement deemed necessary, if any. Being among the first, if not the first, at building a truly decentralized governance model of an eCommerce is a hell of a task with very few prior examples to refer to. The first mainnet model perhaps won’t be perfect, but we have to start somewhere and then improve as we go. This, after all, is the mentality of pioneers!</p><h3 id=\"-18-32-what-added-value-could-sci-provide-for-particl\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uiefPZl6IEw?t=1112\">18:32</a>)— What added value could SCI provide for Particl?</h3><p>Similarly to the previous question about our advisors, we intend on leveraging the founders of SCI, Miguel Cuneta and John Bailon, good friends to the project, much more starting this year. As we shift towards a different stage of the project, one that is likely to be much more business-minded than last year, their expertise and network could become very handy.</p><p><a href=\"https://sci.ph/\"><strong>SCI - Home</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://sci.ph/\"><em>Satoshi Citadel Industries (Bitmarket.ph Inc.) is a financial technology company building the Blockchain ecosystem in…</em></a><a href=\"https://sci.ph/\">sci.ph</a></p><p>Satoshi Citadel Industries is one of the first and biggest blockchain companies in the Philippines. They are very involved with the community and also very well reputed. They sponsor all sorts of events, frequently get TV time, and even advise the local government, banks, and financial institutions. We plan on doing lots of events and joint projects together in the Philippines, and their influence and network will undoubtedly take the project places.</p><blockquote><strong>Other Questions</strong></blockquote><h3 id=\"what-s-happening-with-the-particl-pivx-alliance\"><em>What’s happening with the Particl/PivX alliance?</em></h3><p>The biggest event to come out of this alliance is the inclusion of PART to zDEX genesis launch and zDEX being integrated onto Particl Desktop at some point in time. PART is one of 7 coins included in the initial launch of that decentralized exchange.</p><h3 id=\"what-about-the-social-media-strategy-how-will-this-evolve-with-mainnet\"><em>What about the social media strategy? How will this evolve with mainnet?</em></h3><p>We’ve brought on Lina as our Lead Community Evangelist. She’s a social juggernaut and event planner, speaker among many things. The community will begin seeing more video shorts, graphic eye candy and other treats on Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram in 2019.</p><p>Both Particl the platform and Particl Open Marketplace will have their own social calendars and marketing missions that are independent and play off of each other. Even though at this moment the target audiences of both items are cryptocurrency users, we see the marketplace veering off into more mainstream online buyers and sellers as the year goes by and our products get the necessary features required to appeal to a more mainstream target audience.</p><h3 id=\"what-about-the-vendor-outreach-and-recruitment-strategy-has-this-been-developed-and-if-so-how-will-it-be-implemented-and-what-can-we-expect\"><em>What about the vendor outreach and recruitment strategy? Has this been developed and if so how will it be implemented and what can we expect?</em></h3><p>Large-scale vendor recruitment won’t come until after a full Beta release containing all the planned features that define that release. It could even be later than that, after we integrate more features, especially as it relates to more “mainstream”, non-geeky vendors. The reason for an even later date than Beta to begin recruitment of more mainstream vendors is that they are used to work on web pages and/or mobile apps. Being a downloadable marketplace keeps our adoption rate low until our mobile/web interfaces are developed but rest assured, these are absolutely planned.</p><p>For this reason, we expect some of the first vendors to be those operating in niche industries, vendors facing difficulties with payment processors and/or certain regulations, as well as people looking into acquiring cryptocurrencies. In other words, as the first mainnet versions of the marketplace might be more limited in terms of features, the first vendors are likely to be those suffering the most from the centralized infrastructure of online eCommerce and that will benefit the most from the perks offered by decentralization (barely any fee, censorship-proof, privacy, etc).</p><p>As Beta Release Candidates start to be released, each of them will contain new features that are likely to grow the target audience each time they get added. Whether it be messages, improved privacy, inventory management, or reputation, each new feature makes the marketplace more attractive and user-friendly to a wider audience.</p><p>We already have a pretty good idea of the types of vendors that would highly benefit from a decentralized marketplace like ours, especially when the marketplace starts getting most of the more mainstream features in place, so these will be targeted and definitely contacted when the marketplace will be able to accommodate their businesses.</p><h3 id=\"do-we-have-an-estimated-date-for-the-hardfork-and-the-beta-release-and-will-the-beta-be-testnet-or-mainnet\">Do we have an estimated date for the hardfork and the beta release and will the beta be testnet or mainnet?</h3><p>We don’t have an estimated date for the hardfork that would move RingCT onto the mainnet branch. As many of you know, we planned on having one hardfork before the end of the year, but Tecnovert, our Lead Particl Core Dev, has been working on a variety of privacy-enhancing improvements and recommends we hold off on the hardfork until Bulletproofs, as well as the privacy-enhancing modifications, can be included into the RingCT scheme we’ve had on testnet for over a year.</p><p>Regarding the next stable marketplace release, the team is in the final run to make a stable release of Alpha with governance and other features many of our testers have been helping within the community since May. So instead of releasing a Beta at the end of the year (2018), we’re terming the same product our Alpha v1.2 and it includes governance with coin weight. This 1.2 Alpha version will be the last Alpha version we release, will be fully stable, and will mark the beginning of the Beta stage of development.</p><p>Additionally, many of you will be happy to learn that, because of its stability, it will be able to ultimately run on Mainnet! To begin, we’ll release the stable testnet builds to everyone and have a select <strong>and limited</strong> group of users running the mainnet version. The mainnet version of Alpha will then be opened up to everyone!</p><p>Following the Alpha v1.2 release of the Open Marketplace, the team will begin working on a development branch of the code to focus on the next marketplace release — Beta. We shifted the timeline and terminology so that we could move our Alpha proof-of-concept to mainnet.</p><p>Beta release isn’t nailed down to a specific date, but the team is shooting for March 2019 for a full Beta release to be ready. As always, this doesn’t constitute a deadline but can give a general idea. In the meantime, leading up to that full release, the team will release regular Release Candidates that will feature new tools for buyers and sellers. This is different than Alpha where the team was focused on the base of the marketplace. Beta will be more focused on popping up features at a quicker pace and should be overall a more exciting stage of development for the community than Alpha was.</p><p>You can get much more information about the planned features for Beta as well as Particl Core by reading the South Africa development meeting update posted on our blog.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><strong>South Africa Team Meetings Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\"><em>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in South Africa from the 16th of November to the 24th…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/south-africa-team-meetings-update-ca12685ffb11\">particl.news</a></p><h3 id=\"when-and-how-do-you-plan-to-do-the-second-fundraising\"><em>When and how do you plan to do the second fundraising?</em></h3><p>The team is going to begin taking a hands-off approach to funding questions. It is really not our place to comment on the funding plans of the Particl Foundation. Moving forward, we’ll volley all questions about the primary round to those board members, and are looking into setting up an AMA/FAQ session with the Foundation itself.</p><h3 id=\"how-much-time-will-be-needed-to-release-a-mobile-version-of-the-marketplace-and-when-can-we-expect-a-particl-copay-wallet-on-ios\"><em>How much time will be needed to release a mobile version of the marketplace and when can we expect a Particl Copay wallet on iOS?</em></h3><p>A mobile version of the marketplace is a future product, but we have zero input at this time as to how long that will take. That’s a team conversation to have when we’re all in the same location and have an open agenda when our current tasks near completion. What we can say is that a mobile version of the marketplace is planned for development at some point in time in the future.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75\"><strong>Interview With Robert Edwards, Particl’s New Senior Developer</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75\"><em>On the 2nd of December 2018, Particl hired a new senior developer, Robert Edwards.

Another update to the mobile wallet will be to give the app cold staking abilities as well as a possible iOS integration (currently being looked into).</p><h3 id=\"are-you-going-to-release-a-roadmap-with-a-timeline\"><em>Are you going to release a roadmap with a timeline?</em></h3><p>We’ll eventually release an update to the roadmap with the new work being developed as future work. Just like our last roadmap, specific dates won’t be attached, but timeframes that coincide with development workloads and schedules will be added when that information is available. We have no ETA on the release of a new roadmap for the moment.</p><h3 id=\"what-kind-of-partnerships-are-you-targeting-and-have-you-a-plan-to-target-mainstream-users-and-nocoiners-except-for-mubiz-\"><em>What kind of partnerships are you targeting and have you a plan to target mainstream users and nocoiners (except for Mubiz)?</em></h3><p>Without a user-friendly way to access the marketplace, we really can’t target mainstream users. Some will be comfortable downloading a client, but a lot won’t. Some vendors will be ok manually inputting inventory but many won’t. Some users will be ok with pseudo-anonymous transactions, many won’t. With each new feature we release, we get closer to our main goal of targeting regular online shoppers/sellers. This takes time and the team is still in the development phase of many of these features that mainstream users have come to expect. Mainstream users and “nocoiners” are definitely a target audience as we believe decentralized marketplaces to be a way of doing eCommerce that can benefit almost anyone. Reaching the point when “nocoiners” start using decentralized marketplaces will take time though, but we are confident we will get there.</p><p>It is also important to note that as Particl is being built as a fully trustless solution, it is ultimately designed to be able to operate without any third-party or partner. The well-functioning of the platform is not dependent on any partner.</p><h3 id=\"when-is-particl-desktop-going-to-be-compatible-with-ledger\"><em>When is Particl Desktop going to be compatible with ledger?</em></h3><p>Desktop features are all taking a backseat to the marketplace as our team is currently fully focused on the last stretch. While the core wallet is currently compatible with Ledger, the Particl Desktop integration will come at a later time — possibly not until summer of 2019 or beyond.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-your-marketing-plan-for-2019\"><em>What is your marketing plan for 2019?</em></h3><p>Similar to our social media strategy, we are creating parallel plans for Particl Project and Particl Marketplace. They’ll play together and sometimes go in slightly different ways, but each is tailored to their target audiences.</p><p>With the current market sentiment, one thing we’ve decided on was to not increase our marketing spending immediately with Alpha coming to mainnet. We will promote it, of course, but our experience has shown that even awesome news doesn’t do much to grow the user base in this market, so we’ve decided to keep the marketing budget as is in order to divert more funds towards development.</p><p>To that end, we’re making a conscious effort to get Particl at more events and meetups. A boots on the ground strategy that directly relates to being one of the only crypto projects to have a product — not still pitching dreams, is an effective way to network and get to meet key people that could assist the project moving forward. Since the start of the bear market, most of the people that were “in it just for the money” have left the space, and so the people that remain and actually go to conferences and events are people truly interested in the tech, decentralization, and all the benefits blockchain can bring to the world. These are the people we believe can help projects move forward, and so we are working towards making these real-life connections.</p><p>Similarly, with the bear market, most blockchain teams have been laying off employees to survive under increasingly tight budgets. In the case of Particl though, we’ve only been getting stronger and bigger this year, which we hope will end up giving us a hedge in terms of real progress being made to our products.</p><p>Note that this may change pretty quickly depending on various scenarios.</p><h3 id=\"are-we-going-to-be-added-to-a-new-big-exchange-soon\"><em>Are we going to be added to a new big exchange soon?</em></h3><p>This is something we, unfortunately, have very little control over. It’s entirely up to the exchanges we have working relationships with to list PART, but we are constantly in contact with them as well as with our legal team to ensure we have all the legal documentation that serious exchanges now require. We strongly believe moving Alpha to mainnet will help us in getting recognized as a serious project, not “just another ICO promising stuff”. With all the noise and the ICO projects out there, leaving the group of projects that are “working on something”, which is the greater majority of blockchain projects as it currently stands, and entering a much more limited group of projects with an actual live product will definitely help showcase all the efforts put into the project and the talent of our developers.</p><h3 id=\"what-are-the-other-dapps-planned-for-particl\"><em>What are the other Dapps planned for Particl?</em></h3><p>The team hasn’t officially planned out any future dapps for the moment. Each person has their own ideas, but that’s a full team discussion yet to happen in a yet-to-be-determined location at a not-yet-planned time, sometime after the Marketplace push is finished. It’s important to note that the marketplace Dapp itself will be the main focus for the foreseeable future, although, with the developer SDK as well as the Community Fund containing ~33k PART, we could start seeing new community developers get involved with the project and building their own Dapp. We also have some of our developers and team members have personal “dream Dapps” they would like to see on Particl, so, yes, definitely, there are some thoughts being put into it, but the marketplace has to be the only focus for now if we want it to release in a timely manner.</p><h3 id=\"about-particl-page-what-is-this-website-what-are-their-goals\"><em>About </em><a href=\"http://Particl.page\"><em>Particl.page</em></a><em>, what is this website, what are their goals?</em></h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.page\"><strong>Particl Page</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.page\"><em>Community is at the heart of every project, crypto or otherwise.

This type of problem needs to be addressed but, as with everything else, at the appropriate time. It’s a good question and a problem the team is eager to solve when the time is right, which likely is going to be sometime after the marketplace push but probably before a mobile and web version of the marketplace is planned.</p><h3 id=\"do-you-know-if-some-distribution-networks-have-been-interested-in-doing-their-trade-on-the-particl-marketplace-if-this-is-not-the-case-what-is-going-to-be-made-to-make-them-understand-their-benefits-to-use-particl-any-qualitative-and-quantitative-studies-about-a-private-mad-escrow-on-competitive-gains-have-been-made-already\"><em>Do you know if some distribution networks have been interested in doing their trade on the Particl marketplace? If this is not the case, what is going to be made to make them understand their benefits to use Particl? Any qualitative and quantitative studies about a private mad escrow on competitive gains have been made already?</em></h3><p>No studies have been performed by our team or outsourced to a third-party regarding MAD escrow usage as it relates to distribution networks. It’s a good study to have done if someone wants to lead it. We’d welcome any new involvement and can help in many ways with the right leadership in these types of analysis.</p><h3 id=\"i-think-you-should-rename-private-markets-in-confidential-markets-\"><em>I think you should rename “Private Markets” in “Confidential Markets”.</em></h3><p>We’re actually leaning towards “Open Marketplace” for the main marketplace and “Bubbles”, which is interestingly popular within the community, for the private markets feature set. In that sense, the Open Marketplace can be seen as a large bubble surrounded by smaller bubbles. Both are private by design, but the private markets can be tailored to sub-communities, clients, or products. We’ll probably continue testing names, so thanks for your suggestions. They are great too!</p><h3 id=\"albin-has-a-plan-to-organize-a-particl-hackathon-in-france-you-should-contact-him-about-that-\"><em>Albin has a plan to organize a Particl Hackathon in France you should contact him about that.</em></h3><p>Sponsoring Hackathons, especially ones focused on Particl SDK, is a home run anytime anyone wants to organize one. Scheduling it after the release of the developer SDK makes the most sense though as participants would have access to the whole array of development tools specifically made for building Dapps and marketplace features on Particl.</p><hr><p>This concludes the AMA/FAQ part of this Community Update.

All rewards\nearned while staking from a pool are sent over to the pool operator, which then\nexecutes payouts proportional to how much you’ve contributed to the total amount\nof rewards the pool earned. This is particularly useful if you own fewer coins\nand still want to stake your coins as it means you’ll earn more frequent, but\nsmaller, staking rewards. To know all the benefits cold staking pools can bring\nyou as well as the network, please read our blog post linked just below this\nparagraph.\n\nCold Staking Pools — What You Need to Know\n[https://particl.news/cold-staking-pools-what-you-need-to-know-beb57951c3f3]\nCold staking pools have been an item the community has been requesting for\nquite\nsome time, and they are now available…\n[https://particl.news/cold-staking-pools-what-you-need-to-know-beb57951c3f3]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/cold-staking-pools-what-you-need-to-know-beb57951c3f3]\n\nVery shortly after the release of the cold staking pool protocol, we were\ndelighted to see three independently ran pools see the day.\n\n * Tecnovert’s Pool http://66.172.10.231:903/\n * Tecnovert’s Pool (Testnet) http://66.172.10.231:902/\n * CryptoAcademie’s Pool http://167.179.93.172/\n * Particl.Page’s Pool https://pool.particl.page/\n\nTo get more technical information about cold staking pools as well as tutorials\non how to connect to an existing pool or create one of your own, please read our\ndedicated Wiki pages linked below:\n\n * Technical information: https://particl.wiki/pools\n * Join an existing pool: https://particl.wiki/coldstakingpool_connect\n * Create your own pool: https://particl.wiki/coldstakingpool_create\n\nInterview With Robert Edwards\nInterview With Robert Edwards, Particl’s New Senior Developer\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75]\nOn the 2nd of December 2018, Particl hired a new senior developer, Robert\nEdwards.

The Particl Copay upgrades currently\nbeing worked on include multi-currency support (i.e. hold Bitcoin directly on\nParticl Copay), cold staking capabilities, iOS compatibility, and more.\n\nTo get to know Rob a bit better, don’t forget to read his interview published\non\nour blog\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-robert-edwards-particls-new-senior-developer-13cf3600ab75] \nby following the link just above this section of the Community Update!\n\nParticl Core 0.17.1.0 Moves to Pre-Release Stage\nparticl/particl-core\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.0]\nParticl Core integration/staging tree. Contribute to particl/particl-core\ndevelopment by creating an account on GitHub.\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.0]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.0]\n\nTo get a strong start of the year, Tecnovert moved Particl Core 0.17.1.0 to its\npre-release stage, on mainnet. This means anyone can now download and install\nthis new Core update.\n\nIt’s important to note that, even though a lot of progress has been made on\n0.17.1.0 as it relates to the Trezor hardware wallet integration\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed], this\nupdate does not bring any new immediate feature or fix to Particl, and is being\npushed in the spirit of keeping our codebase up-to-date with Bitcoin’s at all\ntime.\n\nParticl’s Github Page Reaches 20,000 Commits\nOn December 12, Particl Core’s Github repository reached an interesting\nmilestone by registering it’s 20,000th commit (now standing at 20,185\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core])! This is both a testament to the\nteam’s relentless efforts at building the Particl platform and the benefits of\nkeeping our codebase up-to-date with Bitcoin’s.\n\nParticl Ranks as the 11th Best Crypto Github Account of 2018\nAnother clear demonstration of what we mean when we say we’re out here to code\nand develop, not just hype and waste time, is the fact that Particl was ranked\nby CoinCodeCap [https://coincodecap.com/] as the 11th best crypto Github project\nin 2018. CoinCodeCap is similar in nature to Darpal Rating\n[https://medium.com/dprating] (which unfortunately hasn’t put out any new Github\nranking for months) and ranks projects not based on price or marketcap, but by\nthe actual development being made to it.\n\nHere is how Particl ranked throughout the year in code rankings:\n\n * CryptoMiso [https://www.cryptomiso.com/] (last 12 months) -> 21st\n * CoinCodeCap [https://coincodecap.com/] (last 12 months) -> 11th\n * Darpal Rating [https://medium.com/dprating] (monthly) -> Constantly between\n   3rd and 7th, except for their last report where they oddly started taking\n   marketcap into consideration\n * Chinese KOL [https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/962457662423273472] \n   (February 2018) -> 4th\n\nParticl’s Development Year in Review\nWe’ve just published an animation of all the work that’s been done over the year\non Github. Using the same open-source software we used for our Development\nTimeline blog post\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-timeline-video-520d8f9c0513], we’ve\nfocused on the work done by the Particl team on all active Particl Github\nrepositories [http://github.com].\n\nIn the above video available on our Youtube channel\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnuttPuAY6AOenTz2GGMnbg], developers with\ntheir names in green represent Particl team members while developers with their\nnames in white/grey are Bitcoin folks. Not only does this video proves that the\nParticl development team is relentless and very active, but also shows just how\nbeneficial keeping our codebase up-to-date with Bitcoin is.\n\nYes, it does look like Bitcoin developers are making commits to Particl Core,\nbut they’re really making commits to Bitcoin Core. The reason why they’re\nshowing up on Particl Core is because all changes made to the Bitcoin Core code\nis reflected whenever we update our codebase. That means all security,\nstability, and usability improvements made to the Bitcoin codebase are directly\nreflected on Particl Core. It’s like two teams working hand in hand!\n\nMubiz About to Release its New User Interface\n> \nFor those not aware of Mubiz, they are community members building a web\ninterface that will allow you to access Particl’s Open Marketplace directly from\nthe web as well as pay with more traditional means of payments than\ncryptocurrencies. Mubiz will also offer a wide array of services targeted to\nbuyers such as customer support, returns of products, reputation, shipping\nmanagement, escrow management (buyers won’t need to lock up extra funds), and\nmore. In other words, Mubiz seeks to make Particl’s Open Marketplace as easy to\nuse as any other traditional marketplace by building a service on top of the\nParticl protocol.\n\nMubiz announced this week that they will be releasing their new and improved\nuser interface tomorrow (Saturday the 5th of January 2019), and we are very\nexcited to see how it will look like!\n\nInfographics\nWe released two Open Marketplace infographics in December, if you missed those,\nhere they are! Share them far and wide!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis concludes the development update part of this Community Update.

The reason why they’re showing up on Particl Core is because all changes made to the Bitcoin Core code is reflected whenever we update our codebase. That means all security, stability, and usability improvements made to the Bitcoin codebase are directly reflected on Particl Core.

Mubiz will also offer a wide array of services targeted to buyers such as <strong>customer support</strong>, <strong>returns of products</strong>, <strong>reputation</strong>, <strong>shipping management</strong>, <strong>escrow management</strong> (buyers won’t need to lock up extra funds), and more. In other words, <strong>Mubiz seeks to make Particl’s Open Marketplace as easy to use as any other traditional marketplace</strong> by building a service on top of the Particl protocol.</p><p>Mubiz announced this week that they will be releasing their new and improved user interface tomorrow (Saturday the 5th of January 2019), and we are very excited to see how it will look like!</p><h3 id=\"infographics\">Infographics</h3><p>We released two Open Marketplace infographics in December, if you missed those, here they are!

All rewards earned while staking from a pool are sent over to the pool operator, which then executes payouts proportional to how much you’ve contributed to the total amount of rewards the pool earned. This is particularly useful if you own fewer coins and still want to stake your coins as it means you’ll earn more frequent, but smaller, staking rewards.

Not only does this video proves that the Particl development team is relentless and very active, but also shows just how beneficial keeping our codebase up-to-date with Bitcoin is.</p><p>Yes, it does look like Bitcoin developers are making commits to Particl Core, but they’re really making commits to Bitcoin Core. The reason why they’re showing up on Particl Core is because all changes made to the Bitcoin Core code is reflected whenever we update our codebase. That means all security, stability, and usability improvements made to the Bitcoin codebase are directly reflected on Particl Core. It’s like two teams working hand in hand!</p><h3 id=\"mubiz-about-to-release-its-new-user-interface\">Mubiz About to Release its New User Interface</h3><blockquote></blockquote><p>For those not aware of Mubiz, they are community members building a web interface that will allow you to access Particl’s Open Marketplace directly from the web as well as pay with more traditional means of payments than cryptocurrencies. Mubiz will also offer a wide array of services targeted to buyers such as <strong>customer support</strong>, <strong>returns of products</strong>, <strong>reputation</strong>, <strong>shipping management</strong>, <strong>escrow management</strong> (buyers won’t need to lock up extra funds), and more. In other words, <strong>Mubiz seeks to make Particl’s Open Marketplace as easy to use as any other traditional marketplace</strong> by building a service on top of the Particl protocol.</p><p>Mubiz announced this week that they will be releasing their new and improved user interface tomorrow (Saturday the 5th of January 2019), and we are very excited to see how it will look like!</p><h3 id=\"infographics\">Infographics</h3><p>We released two Open Marketplace infographics in December, if you missed those, here they are!

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est. July, 2025\n * Implementation: Upon successful vote (75% approval rate with minimum quorum\n   of 20% of the total supply over 10,080 blocks) and subsequent hard fork.\n\nImpact\nIf approved, this change will:\n\n * Significantly reduce PART's inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%;\n * Reduce PART’s inflation rate by 0.5% every year until it reaches 1.0%;\n * Remove the network treasury;\n * Initiate a hard fork of the Particl blockchain.\n\nWe believe this proposal represents a positive step toward optimizing the\nParticl network's economic model while ensuring sustainable project development\nand incentivising our community to actively promote and grow the\nnetwork.Important: For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are\nrunning its latest version.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come.
