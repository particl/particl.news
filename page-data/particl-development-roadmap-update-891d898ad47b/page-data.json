We’ve identified\nimportant items that are focus features over the next 6 months and beyond but\naren’t tying these to quarters as we did in our Roadmap v1.2\n[https://particl.news/project-update-november-8th-2017-c0437292e1f8].\n\n*New items can be added or taken away at anytime, this is a living document.\n\nIN PROGRESS:\nWith the release\n[https://particl.news/release-particl-core-0-16-0-1-1dad242b075] of Particl Core\n0.16.0.1 the development team debuts a couple features that they have been\nworking on.\n\nSupport for Hardware Signing Devices\nParticl Core 0.16 introduces generic support for Hardware Signing Devices to\nprovide key-signing capabilities.\n\nLedger Integration\nInitial support for the Ledger Hardware Wallet is here!\n\nThis has not yet been extended to blind or anon tranactions and therefore\ncurrently cannot be used exclusively for all functions of the wallet. Support\nwill continue to be extended in future versions.\n\nStealth Addresses V2\nIn order to facilitate deterministic generation of stealth addresses between\nParticl Core and Signing Devices the method used to generate these addresses had\nto be changed.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Marketplace (MP)\nThe majority of our team will be focused on the private decentralized\nmarketplace over the next 6 months. We are readying our Alpha release of the\nParticl Marketplace as I write this.\n\nALPHA is the long-awaited decentralized marketplace dApp within Particl Desktop\n[https://particl.io/downloads/]. The Alpha release of the marketplace will be\nbarebones to start as users begin to test and progress through the\nbuying/selling process.\n\nAs more users onboard we’ll continue refining the user experience and the tools\navailable to vendors and shoppers.\n\nListing Governance\nGovernance won’t be in our initial release of the Markeplace but is one of the\nitems in the pipeline this year. The vision of the Particl Project is to be a\nprivacy focused platform for decentralized applications.\n\nThe Particl Marketplace is being built to be self-sustaining, self-governing and\ncompletely decentralized. Governance is a huge piece of the puzzle that the team\nwill be focused on developing to protect privacy and protect users.\n\nSoftware Development Kit (SDK)\nA plan to have a SDK for developers is in the pipeline. The SDK will allow the\ncreation of applications within the Marketplace or Desktop.\n\nThis might not come in 2018 from the Particl team (it is a pipeline item in the\nfuture) but could be a community development item someone takes on as a side\nproject to create. The full support of the dev team will be available to anyone\nwanting to contribute and help speed of delivery of valuable items.\n\n> A software development kit is typically a set of software development tools that\nallows the creation of applications for a certain software package, software\nframework, hardware platform, computer system, video game console, operating\nsystem, or similar development platform. — Wikipedia\nZMQ for MP Messages\nShort for ZeroMQ [http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#-MQ-in-a-Hundred-Words],\nthis is an automated messaging system that allows messages and notifications to\nbe automatically pushed to Particl Desktop. An example would be if Particl\nDesktop has an update available, ZMQ will push notification to Particl Desktop\nand users will see a notice a new version of the Desktop is available.\n\nBETA Marketplace\nOur next major release of the decentralized marketplace will be BETA.\n\nBeta MP may or may-not be a mainnet viable product. It is too early to tell but\nis something the team will be transparent in communicating.\n\nFactors such as Governance and privacy (RingCT) are big factors on whether a\nmainnet marketplace is available in the next 6 months on mainnet. 50/50 is the\nbest bet at the moment; being completely honest and forthcoming.\n\nA Beta marketplace release with governance but without RingCT could happen with\nour Confidential TX’s (CT) already providing privacy on mainnet. CT do a good\njob of hiding amounts (MAD escrow) but don’t provide complete privacy for\naddresses of vendors and buyers in a escrow contract.\n\nPrivacy and Governance are 2 of the major factors that ultimately will determine\nthe BETA marketplace release in the coming 6 months.\n\nFull Particl Marketplace Release\nAll versions of the MP leading up to full release will be testing versions and\nlive versions with new features introduced at each release. Once RingCT is on\nmainnet, Governance is fully developed, and currency-agnostic options like\ncross-chain atomic swaps/integrations have been through the proper testing\nenvironment we’ll plan a Full Particl Marketplace Release.\n\nThis will be the truly private decentralized marketplace that will disrupt the\nway you buy and sell online.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRing Confidential Transactions (RingCT)\nSpeaking of privacy and RingCT, we will see some exciting movement on this\nprivacy enhancement in the next 6 months.\n\nAcademic Review\nIf you aren’t aware, NJIT research Qiang Tang [https://web.njit.edu/~qiang/] is\nleading a group in a review of our RingCT privacy on Particl Testnet. Particl\nFoundation created a grant with the university in Sept. 2017 for this research,\nQiang’s lab received the grant money in Nov. 2017\n[https://web.njit.edu/~qiang/#activities] and began working on a 6 month review\nin Dec. 2017.\n\nThey are 3 months into review and will provide the foundation with a report\nafter 6 months on the privacy, cryptography and security recommendations for\nParticl’s RingCT implementation on the latest Bitcoin codebase.\n\nBulletproofs: Short Proofs for Confidential Transactions\nA very exciting paper [https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf] was released in\nthe middle of our grant with Qiang (NJIT) that significantly reduces the burden\nof confidential transactions on the blockchain.\n\n> Bulletproofs greatly improve on the linear (in n) sized range proofs in existing\nproposals for confidential transactions in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nParticl is the only Bitcoin-based cryptocurrency with Confidential Transactions\nlive and available today. We don’t allow CT to be default because of the\nsize/cost this privacy introduces to transactions. Here is an infographic you\nmay have seen showing the size/cost of each level of privacy for PART.\n\nYou can see that transaction size of CT and RingCT are 20x that of the\npseudo-anonymous “public” state most users default to.\n\nBulletproofs is a big development that we will be reviewing this year. We\nestimate research, development, implementation and testing will be a 3–4 month\npart-time assignment for Tecnovert, Particl Lead Core Developer.\n\nRingCT — Mainnet\nIt is fair to give a realistic checklist of the steps needed to see RingCT on\nParticl Mainnet in the coming months. Some work has begun, some work will need\nto be adjusted and some work has yet to begin.\n\n*Future dates are estimates and subject to change.\n\n * June 2017\n   [https://particl.news/particl-dev-update-june-1st-2017-f736948a338d]— Particl\n   is the first Bitcoin-based cryptocurrency with CT and RingCT on pre-launch\n   testnets\n * July 2017\n   [https://particl.news/particl-launch-update-july-17th-2017-15ec6d4fd6a8]\n   — Particl launches as first project with privacy available through\n   Confidential Transactions on mainnet.

We plan to\nintegrate Particl Cold Staking into this multi-signature wallet.\n\nCommunity Fund Vote\nThere is PART remaining from the Community Initiative Fund #1\n[https://particl.news/a-community-driven-initiative-e26724100c3a]— roughly\n30,000 PART (at this time) with a few more claims still being vetted. The\ncommunity needs to create a plan for these extra coins that were donated but not\nneeded. Start brainstorming!\n\nLightning Network\nA lot of excitement is stirring in the space because of lightning (LND)\nreleasing on mainnet. Obviously, this is a big item on our radar as we build\npaths for other cryptocurrency coins to be used on Particl Marketplace.\n\n#BlindLightning | #BlackLightning\nWhat if Particl Confidential TXs or even RingCT could be leveraged in atomic\nswaps/ lightning network transactions between PART and other coins — providing\ntrue privacy for non-private coins?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop — future versions\nIn our last AMAFAQ livestream we also mentioned the current status of our\nflagship app, Particl Desktop.\n\nNew features related to the Particl Marketplace integration into Desktop will be\nongoing throughout 2018. We’ve had a lot of requests for extra widgets and\nfeatures from the community/team that are moving down the pipeline.\n\nBelow we’ve begun a checklist of requested features.\n\n * Multiwallet modal\n * Coin Control\n * Alias Addresses\n * Balances and Staking graphs\n * Remote Daemon Connection\n * Tor Integration\n * Settings modal\n * Modal Refactoring\n\nParticl Marketplace is the main focus of the team moving forward, but you can\nexpect to see some of these features coming into Desktop as well. The\nmarketplace is priority number one.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe’re excited to see the impact Particl Marketplace and PART have in our space\nfor 2018–2019. We all see an opportunity to provide use cases for other coins\nwith our privacy focused decentralized applications — starting with the\nMarketplace.\n\nJoin us in our Riot/Telegram channels to get involved:\n\nRiot [https://riot.im/app/#/room/#particl:matrix.org] | Telegram\n[https://t.me/particlproject] | Discord [https://discordapp.com/invite/2tVJaZ9]\n\nThank You\nParticl Team","html":"<h3 id=\"roadmap-v2-0\">Roadmap v2.0</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Development-Roadmap-Update/1-NeiX68LG3hZH2YS030QiKw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>We teased this a bit in our last AMA <a href=\"https://youtu.be/7DNm9l3GmRs\">livestream</a>, and here is a more complete look at what the Particl development team will be working towards for the upcoming 6 months and beyond. <a href=\"https://particl.io/roadmap/\">https://particl.io/roadmap/</a></p><p>The following items are all in our 2018–2019 pipeline.

Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Particl-Qt (on Mac) or\nparticld/ particl-qt (on Linux).\n\nCompatibility\nParticl Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using the Linux\nkernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported.\n\nparticl/particl-core\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.16.0.1]\nparticl-core - Particl Core integration/staging tree\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.16.0.1]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.16.0.1]\n\n*Particl Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\nfrequently tested on them.\n\nNotable changes — Wallet\nSupport for Hardware Signing Devices\nParticl Core 0.16 introduces generic support for Hardware Signing Devices to\nprovide key-signing capabilities.\n\n * New RPC commands\n   * listdevices\n   * getdeviceinfo\n   * initaccountfromdevice\n   * getdevicepublickey\n   * getdevicexpub\n   * devicegetnewstealthaddress\n   * devicesignmessage`\n   * devicesignrawtransaction\n\nLedger Hardware Support\nInitial support for the Ledger Hardware Wallet has been included.\nThis has not yet been extended to blind or anon tranactions and therefore\ncurrently cannot be used exclusively for all functions of the wallet. Support\nwill continue to be extended in future versions.\n\n*Note, this is still considered “expert” mode for those who have a good\nunderstanding of how the Protocol works under the hood and are comfortable\ncompiling and flashing developer tools on a Ledger device.\n\nStealth Address v2\nIn order to facilitate deterministic generation of stealth addresses between\nParticl Core and Signing Devices the method used to generate these addresses has\nbeen changed.\n\n * New RPC command devicegetnewstealthaddress will generate a v2 Stealth Address\n   from the Hardware Signing Device.\n * Updated RPC command getnewstealthaddress now supports a new boolean makeV2\n   (default false) which will generate a v2 Stealth Address from the same method\n   used for hardware wallets. This will be updated in a future release to\n   default to true for all new addresses generated.\n\n*Note, Legacy Stealth Addresses are not supported on Hardware Signing Devices.\nIf you have PART/tPART received on the Legacy Stealth Addresses then we suggest\nyou send those PART/tPART to a non-Stealth Address before attempting to use with\nthe Hardware Signing Devices.\n\n> PART = coins on mainnet | tPART* = coins on testnet*tPART have (0)zero value\n\nReplace-By-Fee by default in GUI\nThe send screen now uses BIP125 RBF by default, regardless of -walletrbf. There\nis a checkbox to mark the transaction as final.\n\nThe RPC default remains unchanged: to use RBF, launch with -walletrbf=1 or use\nthe replaceable argument for individual transactions.\n\nWallets directory configuration (-walletdir)\nParticl Core now has more flexibility in where the wallets directory can be\nlocated. Previously wallet database files were stored at the top level of the\nparticl data directory. The behavior is now:\n\n * For new installations (where the data directory doesn’t already exist),\n   wallets will now be stored in a new wallets/ subdirectory inside the data\n   directory by default.\n * For existing nodes (where the data directory already exists), wallets will be\n   stored in the data directory root by default.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model.

the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
