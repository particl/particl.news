It requests 35,250 PART per month from the treasury fund for a period of\n6\nmonths only after which the team will submit a new funding...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/12]> Reminder: You, and anyone else, can submit proposals on the CCS platform and\nrequest funds from the treasury to support projects and initiatives that improve\nthe Particl ecosystem. This team proposal is just one example of what anyone can\npropose to Particl stakeholders.\nTable of Contents\n * Progress Since the First Funding Request\n * The Funding Request in Details\n * Vision and Development Priorities\n * How to Vote\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProgress Since the First Funding Request\nAbout 6 months ago, the Particl team started drawing funds from the treasury\nafter its first funding request was approved by Particl stakeholders. Since that\ntime, we’ve worked on improving and expanding the ecosystem with various\nimprovements and additions. \n\nHere’s a brief list of what we’ve done since being granted funds from the\ntreasury.\n\n * Particl V3 mainnet release (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/particl-v3-now-available-on-mainnet/])\n * Particl V3.1 mainnet release (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-1-live-on-mainnet/])\n * Announce BasicSwap, a cross-chain and private DEX, and prep it for its open\n   beta (learn more [https://particl.news/introducing-particls-basicswap-dex/])\n * New Particl.io website (check it out [https://particl.io/])\n * New roadmap (check it out [https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/])\n * Published our short to mid-term marketing plans (check it out\n   [https://particl.news/marketing-particl-to-the-world/])\n * 10 Particl Core releases, including 0.21.x.x pre-releases (learn more\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases])\n * Scheduled a new hardfork to fully activate Taproot (learn more\n   [https://particl.news/february-2022-hardfork/])\n * Particl Electrum wallet with Lightning Network support (work-in-progress\n   [https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-10-09-2021#particl-core-development-report]\n   )\n * New legal entity formed to support the project\n\nRoadmap Progress\nAside from the project-wide milestones mentioned above, we’ve also made great\ndevelopment progress. Here are the roadmap items we’ve completed or made\nprogress to during the past six months.\n\nMajor Milestones\nBasicSwap DEX We announced that we would be releasing a new app into the Particl\necosystem; BasicSwap. BasicSwap is a cross-chain and private decentralized\nexchange (DEX) protocol that allows you to swap one cryptocurrency for another\nwithout any middleman or third-party being involved. It is currently in closed\nbeta; its open beta is expected to begin very shortly in early 2022. \n\nWeb framework Although we haven’t officially communicated on this yet, we’ve\nmade preliminary progress in building certain aspects of what will allow Particl\napps, like Particl Marketplace or BasicSwap, to be accessible from the web. We\nwill be progressively ramping up development on that front in 2022 and we are\nlikely to deliver web access to Particl apps in increments rather than all at\nonce. We’ll have more information to share a bit later on. \n\nBlockchain and Coin\nImproved zap functionality We’ve released an update to the cold staking zap\nfunctionality that allows for more a granular management of the zapping process.\nThe process has been optimized and made more private. You can also now choose\nbetween two zapping options; optimized for staking or optimized for privacy. \n\nParticl Electrum Although not yet released, we’ve worked on a new light wallet\nfor Particl: Particl Electrum. It’s a fork of the popular Bitcoin Electrum\nwallet and lets you send and receive coins on a secure wallet that doesn’t need\nto sync the entire blockchain. Particl Electrum will play an important part in\nsome of the things we have planned ahead. Notably, the light wallet provides\n\"light services\" that can be used to provide Particl apps with access to the\nblockchain without syncing it entirely. It also provides an easy way to use the\nLightning Network through a built-in interface, although converting that code to\nParticl is very much in progress and not an immediate priority for the moment. \n\nTaproot Support In December 2021, we scheduled a hardfork to activate the\nlong-anticipated Taproot protocol improvement. Taproot introduces many new\nfeatures and capabilities to Particl’s blockchain, notably in the area of\nprivacy and output management. This will improve the privacy and fees of Particl\napplications like Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap due to the better processing\nof their complex transactions. You can learn more about Taproot by following \nthis link [https://river.com/learn/what-is-taproot/]. \n\nMarketplace\nImproved inventory import/management We added to Particl Desktop 3.1 many\nimprovements to the inventory management aspect of the marketplace. Sellers now\nhave access to more options when importing their inventory from CSV files and\ncan easily adjust their product prices in bulk to account for any PART price\nchanges. A notable variety of other improvements related to the management and\npublishing of listings has also been added. \n\nAdjustable escrow deposit ratios A major item we’ve completed with Particl\nDesktop 3.1 is the addition of a customizable security deposit ratio for\nmarketplace escrows. Before this update, both sellers and buyers had to lock\n100% of the value of a transaction in an escrow contract. These security\ndeposits are refunded, in full, once a transaction is completed. But with\nParticl 3.1, it’s now possible for the seller to set custom deposit ratios\nbetween 0% and 100%. This was one of the most requested features from\nmarketplace users and it opens the platform to a wider range of audiences and\nuse-cases. \n\nA ton of general improvements Aside from the two major additions mentioned\nabove, a large number of additions, improvements, and bug fixes have been added\nto Particl Marketplace. Because there is way too much to mention here, we invite\nyou to check out the full list of changes available here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.0]. \n\nDesktop\nMultiple Particl Desktop improvements Various additions, improvements, and bug\nfixes have been made to Particl Desktop. These are changes that are not\nexclusive to the marketplace app itself. Just like with the general marketplace\nimprovements, the list of changes is too big to put here; we invite you to check\nout the full list of changes here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.0]. \n\nThe Funding Request in Details\n * Funding request: 35,250 PART (monthly)\n * Duration: 6 months\n\nThis funding request suggests supporting the Particl team and funding its\noperations by claiming 35,250 PART, monthly, from the Treasury Fund for 6 months\n. Once this period expires, the proposal will no longer be valid. The team will\nthen publish a new, updated funding request and get it approved by Particl\nstakeholders to claim funds again.\n\nAdditionally, to protect itself from price volatility and ensure uninterrupted\noperations, the team is opting to claim funds based on a price of 1 PART = $1.\n\nFunding Distribution Breakdown\nThe funds requested by the Particl team are intended to serve multiple purposes\nother than just funding development. Here is how the funds are expected to be\nallocated.\n\n * Development (60%), to fund the development of the Particl ecosystem and\n   expand the current development team. Resources will also be allocated to work\n   on various items other than Particl Core, Desktop, and Marketplace. This\n   includes, but isn't limited to, the SMSG network (SMSG 2.0), BasicSwap\n   (atomic swap DEX), preliminary work and research for web and mobile\n   platforms, and so on. Funds allocated here may also be used to expand the\n   development team.\n * Marketing and community (20%), to increase Particl’s brand awareness and\n   exposure within the cryptocurrency, blockchain, e-commerce, and other related\n   industries. Also includes onboarding new community members, expanding on\n   welcoming efforts on current platforms, as well as expanding social media\n   communities. Any funds allocated to marketing that remain unused during this\n   funding cycle (and the previous one) are kept for later use. In other words,\n   not using all the funds allocated for marketing simply leads to more funds\n   being available for later on.\n * Management, legal, and administration (10%), to fund any administrative or\n   corporate costs (i.e., human resources, accounting, project management, legal\n   costs, corporate fees, etc.).\n * Business development (10%), to pursue strategic opportunities, develop\n   partnerships/relationships, and identify/capitalize on new markets for\n   Particl's line of products. This also includes advisory and exchange listing\n   (and promotion) budgets.\n\n> Note: All funds voted to be allocated to the Particl team are held and managed\nby SoonTM Development Ltd, a software development company registered by the\nteam. \n\nAny unused PART will be safely deposited into the team’s reserves to provide\nfunding for later or unforeseen expenses, or increase individual cost-related\nactivities. Please note that the above distribution model is approximate and the\nteam may rearrange it as needed.\nVision and Development Priorities\nAfter spending a lot of time doing foundational work in the past few months, a\nlot of what we’ve been working on is expected to start blooming in 2022. Mind\nyou, we’ve still got a lot of foundational work on our plate, but, this year,\nthere’ll be much more to show for it.\n\nIn fact, we intend to start 2022 strongly! With Particl Desktop 3.1 live, now’s\nthe time to focus on some more exciting roadmap items that will provide a bigger\ndifference in the end-user experience; making the adoption of the platform much\neasier than it was before.\n\nDevelopment Priorities\nWith this in mind, here are our main development priorities for the coming 6\nmonths. Note that any item mentioned here is subject to change at any time as we\nconstantly adapt our development strategy to various factors. Some items may be\nadded to the list as we go, and some may be withdrawn from it. This is an\never-evolving situation.\n\nFor more details on each of these items, please check out our roadmap by\nfollowing this link [https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/].\n\nNew Roadmap Revealed (2021)Discover Particl’s new development roadmap and learn\nabout the next critical steps forward.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/] General\nBasicSwap DEX BasicSwap will receive a lot of focus for the first half of 2022.\nWith its open beta phase looming over, you can expect it to be functional and\npublicly available early during this new development cycle. We’re also happy to\nannounce we’ve still got a lot of surprises which we’ve been working on in that\nregard, but haven’t announced yet. These will take the DEX to a whole other\nlevel, notably in terms of usability, and should take care of boosting Particl’s\ngeneral adoption and exposure within the space. \n\nWeb framework The “web framework” refers to the ability to port Particl\napplications to the web, making them accessible from your favorite browser\nwithout the need to sync a blockchain or the SMSG network, and without having to\ndownload any application. This item will be delivered in increments and we\nexpect that we'll deliver some of the first components of this system during\nthis development cycle. It is a major part of making Particl more accessible to\nthe world and easing its adoption. \n\nKeeping Particl Core up-to-date with the latest Bitcoin code As you probably\nalready know, the Particl coin is a next-generation privacy coin. It uses RingCT\nand CT, much like Monero, but uniquely uses the Bitcoin codebase. As is usual,\nwe pledge to keep its code up-to-date with all the Bitcoin updates, which is\ncritical both in terms of security and usability. \n\nParticl Electrum This new Particl light wallet, based on the very popular\nBitcoin Electrum wallet, provides a lot of “light” functionalities that can be\nleveraged for the many projects we have in mind, notably putting together a new,\nbetter mobile wallet for example. Although that mobile wallet might not see the\nday during the first half of 2022, we expect that, at least, Particl Electrum\nwill. \n\nSMSG 2.0 To ensure that Particl can sustain a much larger number of users, and\nto improve the reliability and performance of applications such as Particl\nMarketplace and the BasicSwap DEX, an update to Particl’s SMSG network is\nplanned for 2022. While we don’t fully expect it to be ready by the end of this\n6-month development period, we are confident that we’ll be making valuable\nprogress towards it. \n\nMarketplace\nBuy flow messaging This Particl Marketplace feature will let buyers and sellers\ncommunicate directly from within Particl Desktop. This is a widely-requested\nfeature that will massively improve the user experience of the marketplace and\nimprove its potential for adoption. This is a preliminary version of a more\ncomplete “chat application” that will eventually serve as a distributed and\nprivate alternative to messaging applications such as a Signal, Telegram,\nElement, etc. \n\nMobile and web gateway (buyers) As we incrementally build components of the web\nframework, they make available some low-hanging fruits. This is the case, for\nexample, of both a web and mobile gateway for buyers. They would make it\npossible for buyers to browse the marketplace from their favorite devices and\npurchase items without having to install Particl Desktop and sync the blockchain\nand SMSG network. The early versions of these gateways are expected to be\nrelatively basic but will serve as a good showcase of what the web framework\nwill ultimately allow. \n\nDesktop\nSMSG controller integration The SMSG controller is more of a back-end\ndeliverable that improves how Particl applications interact with the SMSG\nnetwork. While this item may not lead to apparent changes to the end-user, it\nmakes Particl applications more efficient and lets them support more complex\nfeatures. This is a requirement for more advanced SMSG functionalities such as\napplication extensions and desktop plugins (formerly known as “SMSG bots”). \n\nApp extensions and plugins App extensions and Particl Desktop plugins are\nadd-ons that enhance the user experience. Often, they are third-party services\nthat provide valuable functionality such as allowing you to swap\ncryptocurrencies from the desktop app, get price data through oracles, and so\non. While Particl itself is entirely decentralized, these opt-in modules provide\nuseful features that might require third-parties to get involved. By being\nopt-in rather than opt-out, we ensure that only those looking to use those extra\nservices have to deal with the added level of centralization they require. \n\nHardware wallet integration Another widely-requested feature from some of our\nmost security-conscious community members, building hardware integration into\nParticl Desktop will let you connect your favorite hardware wallet (i.e.,\nTrezor, Ledger Nano) and manage the funds it contains without having to use a\nseparate Particl wallet (Particl-Qt). This will let you use Particl Desktop, and\nits applications, without having to make security compromises. \n\nMarketing\nAs for marketing, our plans remain in line with what we’ve recently announced a\nfew weeks ago in our marketing blog post\n[https://particl.news/marketing-particl-to-the-world/]. Indeed, we intend to\nkeep on gradually ramping up various marketing and outreach efforts as our line\nof products expands and as the barriers to adoption are taken down by the\nrelease of new key features.\n\nHowever, we are planning for a bigger marketing push related to the full release\nof BasicSwap. As we’ve mentioned in the past, we are highly confident in the\nimpact this upcoming DEX will have on the project, not only because of its\nobvious usefulness for the project but also because of the added exposure it\nwill bring to the ecosystem.\n\nDon’t forget, trading is still the number one use-case for cryptocurrencies and\nit’s becoming harder to trade by the day as most exchanges are becoming\nincreasingly restrictive; the release of BasicSwap comes at a very opportune\ntime and will fix a lot of the issues traders face nowadays.\n\nHow to Vote\nVoting on Proposals | Particl Project WikiVoting on ProposalsParticl Project\nWiki [https://particl.wiki/tutorial/staking/how-to-vote/] * To learn more about\n   Particl's on-chain voting system, click here\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_voting.html#].\n * To learn how to\n   vote, refer to this Particl Wiki tutorial\n   [https://particl.wiki/tutorial/staking/how-to-vote/].\n\n> Important: For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are running\nthe latest version of Partyman.

It’s a fork of the popular Bitcoin Electrum wallet and lets you send and receive coins on a secure wallet that doesn’t need to sync the entire blockchain. Particl Electrum will play an important part in some of the things we have planned ahead. Notably, the light wallet provides \"light services\" that can be used to provide Particl apps with access to the blockchain without syncing it entirely. It also provides an easy way to use the Lightning Network through a built-in interface, although converting that code to Particl is very much in progress and not an immediate priority for the moment.\n                        </p>\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck3\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck3\">Taproot Support</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            In December 2021, we scheduled a hardfork to activate the long-anticipated Taproot protocol improvement. Taproot introduces many new features and capabilities to Particl’s blockchain, notably in the area of privacy and output management. This will improve the privacy and fees of Particl applications like Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap due to the better processing of their complex transactions.

But with Particl 3.1, it’s now possible for the seller to set custom deposit ratios between 0% and 100%.

Once this period expires, the proposal will no longer be valid. The team will then publish a new, updated funding request and get it approved by Particl stakeholders to claim funds again.</p><p>Additionally, to protect itself from price volatility and ensure uninterrupted operations, <strong>the team is opting to claim funds based on a price of 1 PART = $1</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"funding-distribution-breakdown\"><strong>Funding Distribution Breakdown</strong></h3><p>The funds requested by the Particl team are intended to serve multiple purposes other than just funding development. Here is how the funds are expected to be allocated.</p><ul><li><strong>Development (60%)</strong>, to fund the development of the Particl ecosystem and expand the current development team. Resources will also be allocated to work on various items other than Particl Core, Desktop, and Marketplace. This includes, but isn't limited to, the SMSG network (SMSG 2.0), BasicSwap (atomic swap DEX), preliminary work and research for web and mobile platforms, and so on. Funds allocated here may also be used to expand the development team.</li><li><strong>Marketing and community (20%)</strong>, to increase Particl’s brand awareness and exposure within the cryptocurrency, blockchain, e-commerce, and other related industries. Also includes onboarding new community members, expanding on welcoming efforts on current platforms, as well as expanding social media communities. Any funds allocated to marketing that remain unused during this funding cycle (and the previous one) are kept for later use. In other words, not using all the funds allocated for marketing simply leads to more funds being available for later on.</li><li><strong>Management, legal, and administration (10%)</strong>, to fund any administrative or corporate costs (i.e., human resources, accounting, project management, legal costs, corporate fees, etc.).</li><li><strong>Business development (10%)</strong>, to pursue strategic opportunities, develop partnerships/relationships, and identify/capitalize on new markets for Particl's line of products. This also includes advisory and exchange listing (and promotion) budgets.</li></ul><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> All funds voted to be allocated to the Particl team are held and managed by SoonTM Development Ltd, a software development company registered by the team. </em><br><br><em>Any unused PART will be safely deposited into the team’s reserves to provide funding for later or unforeseen expenses, or increase individual cost-related activities. Please note that the above distribution model is approximate and the team may rearrange it as needed.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"vision-and-development-priorities\">Vision and Development Priorities</h2><p>After spending a lot of time doing foundational work in the past few months, a lot of what we’ve been working on is expected to start blooming in 2022. Mind you, we’ve still got a lot of foundational work on our plate, but, this year, there’ll be much more to show for it.</p><p>In fact, we intend to start 2022 strongly! With Particl Desktop 3.1 live, now’s the time to focus on some more exciting roadmap items that will provide a bigger difference in the end-user experience; making the adoption of the platform much easier than it was before.</p><h3 id=\"development-priorities\">Development Priorities</h3><p>With this in mind, here are our main development priorities for the coming 6 months. Note that any item mentioned here is subject to change at any time as we constantly adapt our development strategy to various factors. Some items may be added to the list as we go, and some may be withdrawn from it.

We’re also happy to announce we’ve still got a lot of surprises which we’ve been working on in that regard, but haven’t announced yet.

It’s a fork of the popular Bitcoin Electrum wallet and lets you send and receive coins on a secure wallet that doesn’t need to sync the entire blockchain. Particl Electrum will play an important part in some of the things we have planned ahead. Notably, the light wallet provides \"light services\" that can be used to provide Particl apps with access to the blockchain without syncing it entirely. It also provides an easy way to use the Lightning Network through a built-in interface, although converting that code to Particl is very much in progress and not an immediate priority for the moment.\n                        </p>\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck3\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck3\">Taproot Support</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            In December 2021, we scheduled a hardfork to activate the long-anticipated Taproot protocol improvement. Taproot introduces many new features and capabilities to Particl’s blockchain, notably in the area of privacy and output management. This will improve the privacy and fees of Particl applications like Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap due to the better processing of their complex transactions.

But with Particl 3.1, it’s now possible for the seller to set custom deposit ratios between 0% and 100%.

Once this period expires, the proposal will no longer be valid. The team will then publish a new, updated funding request and get it approved by Particl stakeholders to claim funds again.</p><p>Additionally, to protect itself from price volatility and ensure uninterrupted operations, <strong>the team is opting to claim funds based on a price of 1 PART = $1</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"funding-distribution-breakdown\"><strong>Funding Distribution Breakdown</strong></h3><p>The funds requested by the Particl team are intended to serve multiple purposes other than just funding development. Here is how the funds are expected to be allocated.</p><ul><li><strong>Development (60%)</strong>, to fund the development of the Particl ecosystem and expand the current development team. Resources will also be allocated to work on various items other than Particl Core, Desktop, and Marketplace. This includes, but isn't limited to, the SMSG network (SMSG 2.0), BasicSwap (atomic swap DEX), preliminary work and research for web and mobile platforms, and so on. Funds allocated here may also be used to expand the development team.</li><li><strong>Marketing and community (20%)</strong>, to increase Particl’s brand awareness and exposure within the cryptocurrency, blockchain, e-commerce, and other related industries. Also includes onboarding new community members, expanding on welcoming efforts on current platforms, as well as expanding social media communities. Any funds allocated to marketing that remain unused during this funding cycle (and the previous one) are kept for later use. In other words, not using all the funds allocated for marketing simply leads to more funds being available for later on.</li><li><strong>Management, legal, and administration (10%)</strong>, to fund any administrative or corporate costs (i.e., human resources, accounting, project management, legal costs, corporate fees, etc.).</li><li><strong>Business development (10%)</strong>, to pursue strategic opportunities, develop partnerships/relationships, and identify/capitalize on new markets for Particl's line of products. This also includes advisory and exchange listing (and promotion) budgets.</li></ul><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> All funds voted to be allocated to the Particl team are held and managed by SoonTM Development Ltd, a software development company registered by the team. </em><br><br><em>Any unused PART will be safely deposited into the team’s reserves to provide funding for later or unforeseen expenses, or increase individual cost-related activities. Please note that the above distribution model is approximate and the team may rearrange it as needed.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"vision-and-development-priorities\">Vision and Development Priorities</h2><p>After spending a lot of time doing foundational work in the past few months, a lot of what we’ve been working on is expected to start blooming in 2022. Mind you, we’ve still got a lot of foundational work on our plate, but, this year, there’ll be much more to show for it.</p><p>In fact, we intend to start 2022 strongly! With Particl Desktop 3.1 live, now’s the time to focus on some more exciting roadmap items that will provide a bigger difference in the end-user experience; making the adoption of the platform much easier than it was before.</p><h3 id=\"development-priorities\">Development Priorities</h3><p>With this in mind, here are our main development priorities for the coming 6 months. Note that any item mentioned here is subject to change at any time as we constantly adapt our development strategy to various factors. Some items may be added to the list as we go, and some may be withdrawn from it. This is an ever-evolving situation.</p><p>For more details on each of these items, please check out our roadmap by following <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/\">this link</a></strong>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">New Roadmap Revealed (2021)</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Discover Particl’s new development roadmap and learn about the next critical steps forward.</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://particl.news/icons/icon-512x512.png\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Particl News</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">cryptoguard</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://particl.news/static/62859ff1f762453131dee5a6d2c3d04b/medium-roadmap-particl-2021.jpg\"></div></a></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <h2>General</h2>\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat5_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat5_chck1\">BasicSwap DEX</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            BasicSwap will receive a lot of focus for the first half of 2022. With its open beta phase looming over, you can expect it to be functional and publicly available early during this new development cycle. We’re also happy to announce we’ve still got a lot of surprises which we’ve been working on in that regard, but haven’t announced yet. These will take the DEX to a whole other level, notably in terms of usability, and should take care of boosting Particl’s general adoption and exposure within the space.\n                        </p>\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat5_chck2\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat5_chck2\">Web framework</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            The “web framework” refers to the ability to port Particl applications to the web, making them accessible from your favorite browser without the need to sync a blockchain or the SMSG network, and without having to download any application. This item will be delivered in increments and we expect that we'll deliver some of the first components of this system during this development cycle.

Although that mobile wallet might not see the day during the first half of 2022, we expect that, at least, Particl Electrum will.\n                        </p>\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat5_chck5\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat5_chck5\">SMSG 2.0</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            To ensure that Particl can sustain a much larger number of users, and to improve the reliability and performance of applications such as Particl Marketplace and the BasicSwap DEX, an update to Particl’s SMSG network is planned for 2022. While we don’t fully expect it to be ready by the end of this 6-month development period, we are confident that we’ll be making valuable progress towards it.\n                        </p>\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n            </div><!-- tabs close-->\n        </div><!-- col close-->\n            </div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <h2>Marketplace</h2>\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat6_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat6_chck1\">Buy flow messaging</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            This Particl Marketplace feature will let buyers and sellers communicate directly from within Particl Desktop. This is a widely-requested feature that will massively improve the user experience of the marketplace and improve its potential for adoption. This is a preliminary version of a more complete “chat application” that will eventually serve as a distributed and private alternative to messaging applications such as a Signal, Telegram, Element, etc.\n                        </p>\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat6_chck2\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat6_chck2\">Mobile and web gateway (buyers)</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            As we incrementally build components of the web framework, they make available some low-hanging fruits. This is the case, for example, of both a web and mobile gateway for buyers. They would make it possible for buyers to browse the marketplace from their favorite devices and purchase items without having to install Particl Desktop and sync the blockchain and SMSG network. The early versions of these gateways are expected to be relatively basic but will serve as a good showcase of what the web framework will ultimately allow.\n                        </p>\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n            </div><!-- tabs close-->\n        </div><!-- col close-->\n            </div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <h2>Desktop</h2>\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat7_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat7_chck1\">SMSG controller integration</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            The SMSG controller is more of a back-end deliverable that improves how Particl applications interact with the SMSG network. While this item may not lead to apparent changes to the end-user, it makes Particl applications more efficient and lets them support more complex features. This is a requirement for more advanced SMSG functionalities such as application extensions and desktop plugins (formerly known as “SMSG bots”).\n                        </p>\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat7_chck2\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat7_chck2\">App extensions and plugins</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            App extensions and Particl Desktop plugins are add-ons that enhance the user experience. Often, they are third-party services that provide valuable functionality such as allowing you to swap cryptocurrencies from the desktop app, get price data through oracles, and so on. While Particl itself is entirely decentralized, these opt-in modules provide useful features that might require third-parties to get involved. By being opt-in rather than opt-out, we ensure that only those looking to use those extra services have to deal with the added level of centralization they require.\n                        </p>\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat7_chck3\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat7_chck3\">Hardware wallet integration</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p>\n                            Another widely-requested feature from some of our most security-conscious community members, building hardware integration into Particl Desktop will let you connect your favorite hardware wallet (i.e., Trezor, Ledger Nano) and manage the funds it contains without having to use a separate Particl wallet (Particl-Qt).

Indeed, we intend to keep on gradually ramping up various marketing and outreach efforts as our line of products expands and as the barriers to adoption are taken down by the release of new key features.</p><p>However, we are planning for a bigger marketing push related to the full release of BasicSwap.

development progress\nreport. This week, a lot of focus has been put on adding seemingly small but\nquite useful features and improvements to Particl Marketplace.\n\nOther than that, a good amount of focus has also gone into fixing a few minor\nissues and adding general improvements based on various feedback obtained from\nParticl Marketplace users. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop and Marketplace Progress Update\nAs part of the additions and improvements mentioned in the introduction of this\nprogress report, there are four main items worth mentioning, the others being\nvery minor.\n\n 1. Combined the market ID and access/publish key into a single value. This\n    means that there's now only a single value that needs to be copied/used when\n    sharing/joining a market. This is mostly a convenience modification; instead\n    of needing two different values, a single value can be shared.\n 2. Modified how a template for the product is edited. This was required mostly\n    because the large \"Edit Product\" button on a template resulted in the\n    product template being modified, leading to confusion when an existing\n    market template is published and did not contain the modified content. So\n    now the button to edit the market template has been made a little more\n    visible, and the edit product button has been moved to a different location\n    to ensure that it's easier to understand how to edit an existing item.\n 3. Removing the forced requirement to have the Open Market automatically joined\n    and the ability to remove it from the list of markets your client is\n    connected to. This task is in progress and should be completed imminently.\n 4. Displaying a different graphic and message to indicate when no listings are\n    found but the blockchain is still busy syncing. This is part of a wider push\n    to improve various aspects of the marketplace application that may cause\n    confusion, especially to people who are trying Particl for the first time.\n    You can expect a few updates sharing this goal to be included in the next\n    Particl Desktop update.\n\nWhile the aforementioned items are what received the vast majority of this\nweek's focus, we can confirm that in-market messaging (buyer <> seller\nmessaging) is still the primary priority when it comes to new features for\nParticl Desktop 3.2. \n\nAs previously mentioned, this is an early implementation of a wider \"chat\napplication\" that will ultimately let you discuss with others in total privacy\n(no metadata) and without any central server in between processing and passing\nmessages around. The \"in-market\" implementation, namely the ability for buyers\nand sellers to talk to each other on the marketplace, is the first version of\nthat broader vision.\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Report\nThis week, Particl core developer, Tecnovert, has been busy backporting Taproot\ninto the Particl Core 0.19 codebase. While Taproot will be fully functional on\n0.21 following this coming hardfork\n[https://particl.news/february-2022-hardfork/] (1st of February at 17:00 UTC),\nit wouldn't be the case for Particl Core 0.19 without these current\nmodifications.\n\nTaproot Hardfork Announcement (February 2022)Learn everything you need to know\nabout Particl’s upcoming hardfork and prepare ahead with Particl Core\n0.19.2.18.\nParticl Newscryptoguard [https://particl.news/february-2022-hardfork/]And\nbecause Particl currently uses both the 0.19 and 0.21 codebases, it's important\nto ensure that Taproot is compatible and recognized by 0.19 nodes so that no\nissue arises. But more than that, we are happy to report that 0.19 nodes will\nalso be fully compatible with Taproot, just like 0.21, meaning they will not\nonly recognize Taproot transactions but offer full support for it as well.\n\nAside from this rather large task, Tecnovert has spent a good amount of time\nwriting and running tests to make sure the upcoming hardfork goes through\nwithout any issue.\n\nRenewed Particl Team Funding Proposal is Open for Discussion\nAlthough not a development update per se, we wanted to let you know that the\nParticl team has published, on the CCS platform\n[/particl-development-progress-report-15-01-2022/ccs.particl.io], its renewed\nfunding request [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/12].\n\nTeam Funding Proposal #2Learn all the details about the Particl team’s second\nfunding request from the Treasury Fund.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/team-funding-proposal-2/]As a reminder, the Particl team\nis funded exclusively from the network's decentralized treasury. Every six\nmonths, the team needs to renew its funding with a clear proposal that has to\nget approved by Particl stakeholders.\n\nWith the first funding cycle coming to an end in February, the team's second\nfunding request has been published earlier this week and is currently open for\ndiscussion. We invite you to ask your questions and give your feedback by\nleaving a comment directly on the proposal's CCS page.\n\nThe start block of the voting period will be announced next week, so stay tuned\nto Particl News [https://particl.news] for that important information.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe thank you all for your passion, dedication, and valuable contributions to the\nParticl project; you are what makes Particl possible!\n\nWhether you actively work on expanding the ecosystem or simply use the\nmarketplace and send your feedback to the team, every bit helps shaping the\nfuture of de-commerce (decentralized e-commerce) and easing its adoption!\n\nWe wish you a great weekend and we'll see you, like always, back on Monday ?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This week, we've got some interesting news for you as well as a little\nappetizer for what's coming next week.\n\nThe week began with the release of Particl Desktop 3.1, the first update to\nParticl V3. this release introduces adjustable escrow ratios (sellers can decide\nhow much they require buyers to put into escrow) and better inventory management\nfor sellers. It also includes a wide variety of bug fixes, general improvements,\nand quality-of-life tweaks that makes the user experience much better and\nhassle-free.

But perhaps more exciting is\nthe fact that the team has begun working on the first version of an in-market\ncommunication tool that lets buyers and sellers communicate together. \n\nTo quote Particl Desktop developer Arnold Bansemer on the topic: \"The idea here\nis to provide a mechanism to allow for buyers (and potential buyers) and sellers\nto communicate with each other and have the application alert them using\nnotifications. Something like group/individual chat/messaging applications, but\nwhere the subject is the listing or order in question. \n\nParticl Desktop should then also alert the user to the presence of messages or\nresponses. This is mostly a stop-gap to a future, more complete implementation,\nbut for now it should at least provide a means to interact with the other party\ndirectly, particularly when additional information is required for an order or\nprior to purchasing an item.\".\n\nThis in-market communication feature is one of the first items we'll be working\non delivering in the short-term.

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est. July, 2025\n * Implementation: Upon successful vote (75% approval rate with minimum quorum\n   of 20% of the total supply over 10,080 blocks) and subsequent hard fork.\n\nImpact\nIf approved, this change will:\n\n * Significantly reduce PART's inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%;\n * Reduce PART’s inflation rate by 0.5% every year until it reaches 1.0%;\n * Remove the network treasury;\n * Initiate a hard fork of the Particl blockchain.\n\nWe believe this proposal represents a positive step toward optimizing the\nParticl network's economic model while ensuring sustainable project development\nand incentivising our community to actively promote and grow the\nnetwork.Important: For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are\nrunning its latest version.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity.
