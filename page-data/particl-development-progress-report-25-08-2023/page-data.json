You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nExploring New Coin Additions ?\nThis week, we've continued the process of exploring new coins for inclusion on\nBasicSwap and started working on a few integrations.\n\nIn the process, we've encountered unique challenges that necessitated\nimprovements to the BasicSwap codebase. Inded, while the Particl blockchain can\ninterpret transactions from various coins, the reverse isn't always true for\nsome of the coins we're aiming to integrate. Given that BasicSwap was initially\ndesigned for a swift launch with the initial coin release lineup we had at that\ntime, certain assets we're considering now aren't fully compatible with specific\naspects of the existing codebase. \n\nConsequently, we've now opted to embed additional functionalities directly into\nBasicSwap to ensure broader cryptocurrency compatibility moving forward. While\nthese modifications aren't too extensive or expected to become time-consuming,\nthey have been a focal point of our work this week.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nIn addition to the minor cosmetic updates highlighted in last week's report, \nwe've begun refining the New Offer page. Our aim is to streamline the user\nexperience by tucking most advanced options into a collapsible menu and focusing\ninstead on what coins, and what amounts, users want to swap. \n\nThis approach ensures a quicker and more intuitive interface, preventing users\nfrom being overwhelmed by technical choices. However, these options remain\neasily accessible for advanced users who seek them.\n\nPrepare Your Nodes, Voting Starts Tuesday ?️ \nTeam Funding Proposal #4Learn all the details about the Particl team’s fourth\nfunding request from the Treasury Fund.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/team-funding-proposal-4/]Last week, we have published a\nfourth funding request to ensure the continued growth of the Particl project and\nto support the wide-ranging operations of the team.\n\nWe can now announce that voting will start next Tuesday and last from block \n1,493,000 to block 1,498,039, for a total of 5,040 blocks.\n\nBecause this proposal does not propose changes to the protocol, it will require\na participation rate of 20% or more of the total supply and an approval rate of\n60% or more to be considered valid.\n\n> Note: The accompanying CCS page of the proposal should be up in the next couple\nof hours, after which we'll publish a standalone blog post announcing the voting\nparameters and instructions on Particl News.\nHow to Vote ℹ️\nTo cast your vote for this proposal, we recommend using the partyman cold\nstaking application and register your vote on the blockchain for proposal #19. \n\nYou have the options to abstain (0), vote in favor (1), or vote against (2).\nEvery vote matters, and we strongly encourage you to participate as a higher\nparticipation rate means a broader consensus and healthier decision-making\nprocess for the whole community.\n\n * To learn more about Particl's on-chain voting system, click here\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-blockchain/blockchain_governance.html]\n   .\n * To learn how to vote, refer to this tutorial\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/part-guides/partguides_voting.html].\n * For the CCS voting page of this proposal, head over here\n   [https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/team-funding-request-4.html].\n\n> Important: For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are running\nthe latest version of Partyman. To do so, run git pull from inside your partyman \nfolder, and then type the ./partyman update command from that location.\nNew Particl Website ✅\nWe've also been making steady progress on the new website, as has been the case\nfor the past couple of weeks, which we now expect to have a working version in\ninternal testing soon. Live launch should follow shortly after that!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
