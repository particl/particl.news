weekly progress report.\nThis week has once again been a continuation of the various components being\nworked on with steady progress being made on all fronts.\n\nWithout further ado, let's jump right in!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nThis week, the upcoming marketplace messaging system that allows buyers and\nsellers to message each other has been the sole focus. While progress may seem\nslow on that end, it is steady, and we can report that the main hurdles are\nlikely now out of the way.\n\nNext week, we'll be making some related changes to the marketplace codebase and\nputting more focus and emphasis on the UI component of this messaging system.\n\nThe in-market messaging layer is currently the main focus and the last remaining\nmajor item before we can go live with the release of Particl Desktop 3.2.\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Update\nParticl's upcoming light wallet, Particl Electrum, is currently in its last\ntesting phase. We can report that no major issue has been encountered so far\nsince we've started this final round of testing; it's been smooth sailing, and\nthat is an excellent indicator. Particl Electrum should be ready to be released\nnext week!\n\nAs for BasicSwap, we are making outstanding progress both on its user interface\nand codebase. Indeed, we're currently improving various aspects of the codebase\nbut, perhaps more interesting for this update, adding Tor functionality to it as\nwell.\n\nIndeed, once initially released, it will be possible to launch BasicSwap and\nroute it either through \"clearnet\" or through Tor. Furthermore, this option is\navailable right from within the installation process. That means you won't have\nto launch BasicSwap first to adjust this setting, allowing you to avoid\ndeploying your node on either clearnet or Tor if you need to avoid doing so\n(i.e., in some countries, you may want to avoid simply connecting to the Tor\nnetwork).\n\nAbout the user interface, we fully intend on making it as user-friendly as\npossible so that most people can get started quickly and reap its benefits\nwithout needing to be an \"advanced user\". This is a common mistake with\ncross-chain DEXes that often leads to a lack of adoption. To that end, we are\nworking on making the user interface expand on BasicSwap's core functions and\nbring the user experience to a level more similar to what you would expect from\n\"traditional exchanges\". \n\nWe'd also like to mention that, even though we are calling this upcoming launch\nan \"open beta\", the release will be fully functional and let you easily swap\nassets like Bitcoin, Monero, and Particl on their respective mainnet networks.\nDon't be fooled by the \"beta\" status of BasicSwap; we are calling it this way\nbecause we have a much broader vision for it going into the future. Its first\nbeta release should already be smooth enough to become your go-to exchange.\n\nFinally, we've also made good progress on bringing the Particl code up-to-date\nwith Bitcoin's latest version (23.0), and we should have a release ready for it,\nwith the new guix framework, quite soon. As always, this is an ever-ongoing task\nbut still requires a fair amount of effort every week.\n\nSuper Dangerous Club\nAs always, we invite you every Thursday at roughly ~2 PM GMT to tune in to the\nSuper Dangerous Club where Particl advocates Dr. Kap and e-commerce expert Joe\nFisher discuss various outside-the-box topics about the current trajectory of\nour society, politics, and tech.\n\nEvery week, the show is broadcasted on all your favorite platforms. But to\nreally get into the action, we invite you to come and speak your mind directly\nwith our two wonderful hosts on Clubhouse's live episodes.\n\nTo see where the SDC is available, follow the linktree below.

This week has been a continuation of the various components being worked\non with steady progress being made on all fronts.\n\nLet's jump right into the crux of this update!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nThis week, good progress has been made on the marketplace messaging system. As a\nreminder, this system allows for two transacting parties (the buyer and the\nseller) to communicate at any point in time during a transaction. This is the\nlast remaining item before Particl Desktop 3.2 is ready to be released and is\nthe current primary focus of Particl Desktop developer Arnold Bansemer.\n\nAdditionally, two issues that were reported by current active users of the\nmarketplace have been resolved. They are as follows.\n\n 1. Fixing the removal/deleting of images from a template in the marketplace.\n    This issue has been successfully resolved.\n 2. The very first startup of PD at times failed to save the relevant\n    configuration to the core particl.conf file, and then would have all the\n    changes written to the particl.conf on the on 2nd startup. This would result\n    in a potential reindex of the blockchain on the 2nd startup and possible\n    issues on that first use of PD/particl-core.\n\nGoing into next week, working on the messaging system will remain the primary\nfocus as we head towards the release of Particl Desktop 3.2.\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Update\nWhen it comes to Particl Core, a lot of work has gone into merging all the\nlatest changes made to Bitcoin 23.0 into Particl. This is an ever-ongoing task\nand you can follow the progress at any point in time by monitoring the Particl\nCore repository on Github here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nCommits · particl/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree. Contribute\nto particl/particl-core development by creating an account on GitHub.GitHub\nparticl [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master]Aside from that,\nsignificant progress has been made on Particl Electrum with cold staking and\ncold staking pools now being successfully integrated. We are currently testing\nthe client extensively to ensure the integration works as intended. \n\nAdditionally, a few general improvements over the original Electrum codebase\nhave been added in, notably as we intend to use Particl Electrum as the back-end\nfor many of what we have planned moving forward (i.e., web or mobile framework). \n\nNote that, if you prefer using Particl on your mobile device, you'll be happy to\nknow that Particl Electrum comes along with a mobile application. And while its\nupstream interface is rather basic, we'd like to remind you that the primary\ncenter of interest here when it comes to Particl Electrum is the back-end\ncapabilities that it provides. As such and moving forward, its codebase will\nallow for the development of better mobile applications based on it, which could\nserve as solid replacements for the current Particl Copay application.\n\nSuper Dangerous Club\nAs always, we invite you every Thursday at roughly ~2 PM GMT to tune in to the\nSuper Dangerous Club where Particl advocates Dr. Kap and e-commerce expert Joe\nFisher discuss various outside-the-box topics about the current trajectory of\nour society, politics, and tech.\n\nEvery week, the show is broadcasted on all your favorite platforms.

In this week's report, we're providing a bit more information about the\nupcoming BasicSwap DEX and its open beta release timeline, so if you had\ninterrogations about it, be sure not to miss this section!\n\nWithout further ado, let's jump right in. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nThis week, we've wrapped up the new product code functionality which gives the\nability for sellers to better categorize and update their products.\n\nIt allows for a seller to uniquely identify their items according to their own\npredefined system. Note that this has no impact on the buyer side as the product\ncodes are not publicly displayed along with a listing; they simply exist to\nprovide some assistance to sellers in terms of inventory management. It will\nalso allow us to introduce, in the future, additional features to provide more\nthorough product updates via CSV import or alternative methods using product\ncodes as unique identifiers.\n\nOther than that, we've applied a few UI improvements to Particl Desktop, both on\nthe marketplace and desktop apps, as was suggested by current vendors.\n\nGoing into next week, the in-market messaging system (buyer - seller inbox) will\nbe the sole priority and we expect to wrap it up soon, after which Particl\nDesktop 3.2 will be ready for release.\n\nParticl Core Progress Update\nThis week on Core, we've dealt with a tricky issue regarding integrating cold\nstaking and cold staking pools into the upcoming Particl Electrum wallet. This\nissue is still being actively resolved and is the current main focus at this\ntime for Particl's core developer Tecnovert.\n\nBasicSwap DEX Progress Update\nWe've received a few questions this week regarding Particl's upcoming\ncross-chain and private DEX; BasicSwap. As mentioned previously, we are\ncurrently working on the user interface of the protocol. This is the last\nremaining item before its open beta is ready to be released, but it's a critical\none nonetheless as it will largely contribute to the first impression people\nwill have about it. That's twice as true for any user that isn't currently a\nParticl community member (and we absolutely want to welcome them as part of our\nawesome community). That's the reason why we want to spend the proper time to\nensure that the user interface is as optimal and simple to use as possible.\n\nIndeed, in the last few years, we've seen many attempts at decentralized\nexchanges. One of the most recurring reasons why some of them do not see great\nsuccess is because they are too complicated to use for the \"common user\". \n\nTurns out, simplicity is one of BasicSwap's strengths. Indeed, it doesn't\nrequire any complicated terminal operations to function (other than the initial\nsetup, which is only temporary until proper builds are released), and all\nfeatures and functions are fully accessible from a web browser (even though it's\nstill a local application). \n\nBut to reach its full potential, it needs to be properly supported by a simple\nyet powerful user interface. And because the sheer number of features and\noptions available can get confusing for the casual crypto user; we're taking\ngreat care of building an easy-to-use but also eye-candy user interface. After\nall, we do not want to limit our user base to the technically advanced and\ngeeks; we want any crypto user to be able to benefit from a private,\ndecentralized, and no BS trading exchange that's not after their money or data. \n\nIt's important, however, to keep in mind that the first version of BasicSwap\n(its open beta) is only the first step towards a more ambitious goal. Although\nwe are confident that the open beta itself, which will run on mainnet, will\ngather a good number of users on its own, the real game-changer comes once we\nsuccessfully complete a more flexible framework we're working on.\n\nIndeed, we are working, right at this moment, on a flexible framework that would\nmake it easier for anyone to leverage the BasicSwap protocol and deploy the\nsystem on other platforms (i.e., Particl Desktop, a website, cryptocurrency\nwallets, etc). Once that is complete, that's when we expect BasicSwap to really\nshine and be integrated by partners and other players within the blockchain\nindustry. That's directly in line with our inclusive and non-tribalistic\napproach; a decentralized, free (as in freedom), and private ecosystem built for\nthe benefit of all.\n\nBut as for the progress being made on the user interface of the open beta\nitself, we have been making very good progress on it specifically within the\npast two weeks. We can confirm it is the current main focus of Particl designer\nGerlof van Ek and we expect to be able to start teasing the UI soon enough.\n\nKeep an eye out for any update on Particl News as BasicSwap is the next big\nthing to attach itself to the Particl ecosystem. We are inching closer than even\nto become 100% unstoppable! \n\nSuper Dangerous Club\nHave you tuned in to the Super Dangerous Club yet? Every Thursday at roughly ~2\nPM GMT, Particl advocates Dr. Kap and e-commerce expert Joe Fisher discuss\nvarious outside-the-box topics about the current trajectory of our society,\npolitics, and tech. \n\nYou might hear about...\n\n?

As mentioned previously, we are currently working on the user interface of the protocol. This is the last remaining item before its open beta is ready to be released, but it's a critical one nonetheless as it will largely contribute to the first impression people will have about it. That's twice as true for any user that isn't currently a Particl community member (and we absolutely want to welcome them as part of our awesome community). That's the reason why we want to spend the proper time to ensure that the user interface is as optimal and simple to use as possible.</p><p>Indeed, in the last few years, we've seen many attempts at decentralized exchanges.

This week, we've made some good progress in improving both Particl\nDesktop and Particl Core, so let's look into it right away.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nThis week, Particl Desktop developer Arnold Bansemer has suffered a minor injury\nthat took time off of major tasks. With this context in mind, he focused on\nsmaller (but needed) and easily deliverable improvements proposed by some of our\nmarketplace sellers.\n\n 1. In the wallet transaction list, transactions that have been abandoned will\n    now be properly displayed instead of showing the current \"0/12\n    confirmations\" indicator. Users will also be able to abandon transactions\n    right from Particl Desktop.\n 2. A filter to the \"batch publish\" modal has been added. It lets sellers filter\n    the visible products by published market, enabling them to more easily\n    republish listings when they have multiple markets and many items (with\n    items specific to particular markets). In short, it provides them the option\n    to only show items belonging to a particular market, rather than searching\n    through all the items across all the markets one by one. In some cases, it\n    can save several minutes, if not hours, especially when it comes to large\n    vendors who often update their inventories and regularly add new items.\n\nLooking forward to the coming week, we'll be able to resume progress on product\ncodes and hopefully wrap it up before the end of the week. Then, we'll continue\nworking on the in-market messaging system to get it ready for the upcoming\nParticl Desktop 3.2 update.\n\nParticl Core Development Update\nThis week, we've added some improvements and bug fixes to the Particl Core 0.21\ncodebase.

Without further ado, let's jump right into the meat of this progress\nreport.\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nThis week, we've finalized the improvement to the marketplace that lets you\nremove the default market from Particl Desktop. That change is now completed and\nready for release with the upcoming desktop update.\n\nAdditionally, we've made progress on the messaging system that allows buyers and\nsellers to communicate with each other straight from the marketplace. We've also\nmade progress on the new product code function, and both of these items will get\nprimary focus moving into next week.\n\nOn the topic of product codes, as we've mentioned in our last update, it is an\nessential item for the delivery of the marketplace listing seeding proposal. For\nthat reason, we're making sure that the feature will be ready for Particl\nDesktop 3.2 in order to deploy the system suggested by the proposal promptly. To\nmake that happen more quickly, we will initially release this feature on vendor\nnodes only (no GUI integration).\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Update\nAs for Particl Core, most of the week has been spent improving Particl Electrum\nand fixing a few reported issues. We're happy to report that Particl Electrum is\nnearing its official release and will be made available from both desktop and\nmobile devices. \n\nAdditionally, core's default ring size has also been adjusted to match the\ndefault value of Particl Desktop, improving privacy by unifying the values of\ndecoys.\n\nOn the topic of privacy, we invite you to read an important blog post we've\npublished this week on Particl News. It details our vision for the project, what\nrole privacy plays into it, and why we've designed PART's privacy setup the way\nwe did.

This update fixes various\nbugs and issues identified by live users (buyers and sellers) from the\ncommunity. It also introduces a few general improvements to the marketplace to\nimprove the user experience and make it more reliable.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started\nDownload Particl Desktop 3.1.1 on mainnet: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.1\n\nRelease v3.1.1 · particl/particl-desktopParticl Desktop v3.1.1NB!! The source\ncode linked to here is not the actual tagged release source code. Please\ncontact\nParticl for source code information. The actual source code will be uploaded\n...\nGitHubparticl [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.1]If\nyou happen to be a newcomer to Particl at all we highly recommend the Particl\nAcademy as your guide and reference book for getting along with Particl\nMarketplace.\n\nOpen Particl Academy [https://academy.particl.io]\n\nNotes\n * Your wallet needs to be unlocked to process buy and sell orders on the\n   marketplace.\n * If you spot any issue, bug, or area of improvement, please report it directly\n   on the Github Issues [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] \n   page.\n * The source code linked to here is not the actual tagged release source code.\n   Please contact the Particl team for source code information. The actual\n   source code will be uploaded and made available after an appropriate interval\n   of time has passed.\n\nAdvanced Start-up\nSometimes, it's helpful to start the application from the terminal, aka command\nline. It gives you additional information about what's happening in the\nbackground and can be useful for troubleshooting issues (if issues you\nencounter).\n\nWindows\n 1. Open \"Windows Explorer\"\n 2. On the installation folder (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\Particl Desktop\\Particl\n    Desktop\") Press [SHIFT⇧]+[MOUSE-RIGHT◳] and choose \"Open command window\n    here\"\n 3. Type the following command including the quotation marks into the terminal\n    and hit [ENTER ↵] \"Particl Desktop.exe\"\n\nMac\n 1. Open \"Terminal\" \n    (e.g. [COMMAND ⌘] + [SPACE] and type terminal > hit [ENTER ↵])\n 2. Type in this command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    /Applications/Particl\\ Desktop.app/Contents/MacOS/Particl\\ Desktop\n\nLinux\n 1. Open a terminal in the folder where you’ve installed the application and\n    type the following command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    ./Particl\\ Desktop\n\nList of Changes\nGeneral\n * The window title now correctly reflects the chain that the application is\n   started with, so as to more readily distinguish between running the\n   application on testnet or mainnet.\n\nMarketplace App\nIncluded here are the changes applied to both the UI of the marketplace, as well\nas the market service, for convenience:\n\n * Fixes an edge case when an order request might fail to be made despite\n   sufficient funds (and utxos) being available.\n * Fixes an order request not being able to be progressed by either buyer or\n   seller after being made, if the seller escrow amount required is 0.\n * Ignores received listing messages if the listing in the message has expired\n   by the time the listing message is processed. This means that the processing\n   of actual, valid listing messages are processed a lot sooner rather than\n   spending time processing messages that are not going to be useful to begin\n   with (i.e., faster time to see messages when joining a market), as well as\n   preventing the unnecessary updating of the \"pending new items\" refresh button\n   count with expired listings.\n * Adjusts the checking of available utxos when publishing listings to a market.\n   This should provide some measure of preventing cases where listings are\n   published without their associated images.\n * Prevents an order status from incorrectly being updated if the buyer attempts\n   to cancel an order in the \"escrow locked\" status but the seller has already\n   completed the escrow transaction and the buyer node simply has not received\n   the updated status message). Previously, the order status was incorrectly\n   updated to the \"cancelled\" status despite the cancellation request failing;\n   the status is now untouched if the cancellation fails.\n * Fixes listing and market images not being correctly removed from the\n   filesystem.\n * Removes the current listings associated with a market as well when a market\n   is un-joined, rather than leaving the listings and waiting for the listing to\n   expire before removing it.\n * Combines the market ID and applicable market key into a single value: rather\n   than needing to copy out 2 values for sharing access to a market, only one\n   value is now needed. The same applies for the market joining: only a single\n   value is needed to be entered, rather than 2 separate values.\n * Removes the 'Edit Product' button and instead places it inside of a separate\n   \"product info\" modal: this is to more clearly distinguish between editing of\n   a product template and a market-specific template (which tends to cause\n   confusion when a market template requires editing but the product template\n   edit action is more visible and tended to be used more readily instead).\n * Changes the displayed graphic and accompanying text when browsing a market\n   with no listings: a different graphic (and text) is now displayed when the\n   blockchain is still syncing, to clearly distinguish why there may be no\n   listings currently available.\n * Re-sends the escrow complete message in addition to the shipping message when\n   a seller re-sends the order status at the shipping step. If the buyer side\n   was missing the escrow complete status message then re-sending the shipping\n   status alone is insufficient to update the buyer status, so both the escrow\n   complete and shipping status messages are resent at the shipping status step.\n * Updates the error to more accurately reflect the reason for failing to\n   publish a listing when the listing itself is successfully published, but one\n   or more images in the listing are not correctly published.\n * Fixes the display of an order item's shipping value to correctly display the\n   actual shipping value used.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs Particl Desktop 3.1.1 fixes various bugs and issues that were encoutered by\nlive users, we invite those users to give this new update a spin and report back\nif any issue still persists (which shouldn't be the case).\n\nWe thank you all in the community for testing Particl Desktop and the\nmarketplace extensively and reporting back.

It improves the privacy and fees of Particl\napplications like Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap due to the better processing\nof their complex transactions. You can learn more about Taproot by following \nthis link [https://river.com/learn/what-is-taproot/].\n\nIncrease the maximum size of data outputs\nThis improvement to the SecureMessaging (SMSG) network allows for more\ndata-containing messages to be broadcast (paid messages) per single transaction,\nmaking the P2P network more efficient.\n\nFixing Dynamic Marketplace Listing Fees\nOn Particl, any staker can influence the size of the listing fees on\napplications like Particl Marketplace. By setting up fee targets, they can\nbroadcast to the rest of the network that they want listing fees on Particl\nMarketplace to be either higher or lower.\n\nHowever, the feature that allows for this ability had been broken ever since\nreaching a certain target value. In fact, at some point in the past, the fee\ntarget amount dropped below a particular threshold and the code didn't allow it\nto change anymore (up or down). This hardfork fixed that issue by clamping the\nminimum amount it can change to 1 sat, making the feature functional and\nallowing stakers to adjust listing fees again. Check out this blog post\n[https://particl.news/adjusting-marketplace-listing-fees/] to learn how you can\nhelp reduce the marketplace listing fees.\n\nAdding Dynamic Supply\nThis new feature reduces the money supply whenever outputs are burned. This\neffectively adjusts the total supply based on the number of coins that get\nburned. This prevents staking rewards to be generated based on a supply value\nthat still counts burned coins. It also ensures a correctly adjusted and dynamic\nstaking emission rate. This feature is intended for future use.\n\nRe-enabling disabled outputs\nThe hardfork also re-enabled a small number of disabled outputs from people who\nhad missed the previous deadline. If you still have disabled outputs and haven’t\nput up your claim yet, please do so as fast as possible by following the steps\nmentioned here [https://particl.news/output-claim-process-is-live/].

Secondly, there are still a few backend\nimprovements, including the setup process, that are in the works to make the\nplatform more user-friendly and stable. \n\nThese requirements are necessary to make BasicSwap more accessible and reduce\nthe time cost of troubleshooting issues with beta testers.

This week, a lot of focus has been put on adding seemingly small but\nquite useful features and improvements to Particl Marketplace.\n\nOther than that, a good amount of focus has also gone into fixing a few minor\nissues and adding general improvements based on various feedback obtained from\nParticl Marketplace users. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop and Marketplace Progress Update\nAs part of the additions and improvements mentioned in the introduction of this\nprogress report, there are four main items worth mentioning, the others being\nvery minor.\n\n 1. Combined the market ID and access/publish key into a single value. This\n    means that there's now only a single value that needs to be copied/used when\n    sharing/joining a market. This is mostly a convenience modification; instead\n    of needing two different values, a single value can be shared.\n 2. Modified how a template for the product is edited. This was required mostly\n    because the large \"Edit Product\" button on a template resulted in the\n    product template being modified, leading to confusion when an existing\n    market template is published and did not contain the modified content. So\n    now the button to edit the market template has been made a little more\n    visible, and the edit product button has been moved to a different location\n    to ensure that it's easier to understand how to edit an existing item.\n 3. Removing the forced requirement to have the Open Market automatically joined\n    and the ability to remove it from the list of markets your client is\n    connected to. This task is in progress and should be completed imminently.\n 4. Displaying a different graphic and message to indicate when no listings are\n    found but the blockchain is still busy syncing. This is part of a wider push\n    to improve various aspects of the marketplace application that may cause\n    confusion, especially to people who are trying Particl for the first time.\n    You can expect a few updates sharing this goal to be included in the next\n    Particl Desktop update.\n\nWhile the aforementioned items are what received the vast majority of this\nweek's focus, we can confirm that in-market messaging (buyer <> seller\nmessaging) is still the primary priority when it comes to new features for\nParticl Desktop 3.2. \n\nAs previously mentioned, this is an early implementation of a wider \"chat\napplication\" that will ultimately let you discuss with others in total privacy\n(no metadata) and without any central server in between processing and passing\nmessages around. The \"in-market\" implementation, namely the ability for buyers\nand sellers to talk to each other on the marketplace, is the first version of\nthat broader vision.\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Report\nThis week, Particl core developer, Tecnovert, has been busy backporting Taproot\ninto the Particl Core 0.19 codebase. While Taproot will be fully functional on\n0.21 following this coming hardfork\n[https://particl.news/february-2022-hardfork/] (1st of February at 17:00 UTC),\nit wouldn't be the case for Particl Core 0.19 without these current\nmodifications.\n\nTaproot Hardfork Announcement (February 2022)Learn everything you need to know\nabout Particl’s upcoming hardfork and prepare ahead with Particl Core\n0.19.2.18.\nParticl Newscryptoguard [https://particl.news/february-2022-hardfork/]And\nbecause Particl currently uses both the 0.19 and 0.21 codebases, it's important\nto ensure that Taproot is compatible and recognized by 0.19 nodes so that no\nissue arises. But more than that, we are happy to report that 0.19 nodes will\nalso be fully compatible with Taproot, just like 0.21, meaning they will not\nonly recognize Taproot transactions but offer full support for it as well.\n\nAside from this rather large task, Tecnovert has spent a good amount of time\nwriting and running tests to make sure the upcoming hardfork goes through\nwithout any issue.\n\nRenewed Particl Team Funding Proposal is Open for Discussion\nAlthough not a development update per se, we wanted to let you know that the\nParticl team has published, on the CCS platform\n[/particl-development-progress-report-15-01-2022/ccs.particl.io], its renewed\nfunding request [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/12].\n\nTeam Funding Proposal #2Learn all the details about the Particl team’s second\nfunding request from the Treasury Fund.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/team-funding-proposal-2/]As a reminder, the Particl team\nis funded exclusively from the network's decentralized treasury. Every six\nmonths, the team needs to renew its funding with a clear proposal that has to\nget approved by Particl stakeholders.\n\nWith the first funding cycle coming to an end in February, the team's second\nfunding request has been published earlier this week and is currently open for\ndiscussion.

It gives you additional information about what's happening in the\nbackground and can be useful for troubleshooting issues (if issues you\nencounter).\n\nWindows\n 1. Open \"Windows Explorer\"\n 2. On the installation folder (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\Particl Desktop\\Particl\n    Desktop\") Press [SHIFT⇧]+[MOUSE-RIGHT◳] and choose \"Open command window\n    here\"\n 3. Type the following command including the quotation marks into the terminal\n    and hit [ENTER ↵] \"Particl Desktop.exe\"\n\nMac\n 1. Open \"Terminal\" \n    (e.g. [COMMAND ⌘] + [SPACE] and type terminal > hit [ENTER ↵])\n 2. Type in this command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    /Applications/Particl\\ Desktop.app/Contents/MacOS/Particl\\ Desktop\n\nLinux\n 1. Open a terminal in the folder where you’ve installed the application and\n    type the following command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    ./Particl\\ Desktop\n\nList of Changes\nGeneral\n * Fixes various typos, incorrect button labels, and incorrect text/label\n   related concerns.\n * Update to using core v0.21.\n\n> Note that for new users, a default wallet is not automatically created, and so\nthe initial wallet generation (when using the wallet module as the first entry\npoint) will allow for a wallet name to be provided.\n> The particl-core setting txindex will be explicitly enabled by automatically\nupdating the particl.conf file.\nMarketplace App\nIncluded here are the changes applied to both the UI of the marketplace, as well\nas the market service, for convenience:\n\n * Allow for backing up the market profile mnemonic and passphrase. These are\n   generated for the profile and stored in the particl-market database. It's far\n   better to allow the user to back these up and remove them from the database.\n\n> Note that each market identity generated derives from the profile wallet, so\nbacking up the profile means that all identity wallets created from that profile\nare backed up as well.\n * Remove the logging out of the profile wallet mnemonic and passphrase.\n * Fixed sent listing image smsgs from leaking some information related to the\n   sender's machine.\n * Fixed an issue with the market browser search ignoring various search\n   criteria under certain cases.\n * When removing a market, particl-core is now correctly informed so as to stop\n   receiving smsg for that market.\n * Reduced the ring size used in marketplace transactions involving anon funds\n   (such as listing fees) from 24 to 12. This should assist with reducing fees\n   slightly.\n * A number of smsg processing issues have been fixed: these should provide for\n   greater stability in both the processing of received smsg, as well as the\n   sending of smsg.\n * The settings page has been updated to better reflect the settings it\n   contains.\n * Fixed an issue when generating a new identity where if the profile wallet was\n   encrypted it failed to generate the new identity: a prompt for the profile\n   wallet passphrase is now correctly presented.\n * Fixed an issue where some settings were incorrectly editable while the market\n   service was starting up.\n * Invalid or missing values on the shipping source country in the\n   product/template editor are now clearly displayed. This field was often\n   missed when creating an item for sale, and so should now have greater\n   visibility when a value is missing.\n * The seller key has been added to the listings detail modal, as requested.\n * The promotion of a market using the incorrect market identity funds (in a\n   multi-identity setup) in some cases, has been fixed.\n * In the market browser, a count of new items received (but not yet displayed)\n   is shown alongside the refresh button.\n * Adds a button in the Settings page to allow for easy re-scanning of smsg\n   messages (rather than needing to manually run commands or use workarounds\n   such as joining a market to obtain the prompt to perform the re-scan).\n\n> Note that once a re-scan is performed, the button is disabled for a few minutes\nafterward: this is normal and allows some time for any message processing to\noccur.\n * Edits to pricing via the batch publish modal are now possible: a percentage\n   value can be set that will update the price of each item by the percentage\n   provided, or alternatively a fixed price can be set per item. Instead of\n   needing to update the price of each item individually prior to publishing, a\n   seller making use of the batch publish feature can now set the prices of\n   items in the batch publish modal.\n * Allow for the seller to specify escrow ratios:\n\n> This is available both via the user interface (in the product/template editor)\nas well as via the csv import (see the help text in the csv import wizard for\nfurther details).\n\nThese values can be viewed in the listings detail window.\n\nDo note that various warnings are presented both when viewing a listing's\ndetails as well as during purchasing/checkout of items to indicate when\nnon-standard escrow ratios are used.\n\nOrders also indicate the escrow ratios used by both parties to provide any\nadditional information that may be needed.\n * A button on each order is added to allow for the re-sending of the last\n   action performed by the user. This might help where the other party never\n   received the message (or some issue prevented the message from being\n   processed correctly), and causing the transaction to appear \"stuck\". The\n   workaround was typically to follow a set of instructions to manually perform\n   the resend... the button replaces the need to perform the manual steps.\n * Images can now be imported via the csv import file to add images when\n   creating initial products. Local paths as well as urls from the internet can\n   be used. See the help text in the csv import wizard for further details.\n\nWallet\n * Use existing stealth addresses when performing a balance transfer: this helps\n   to reduce the unnecessary generation of stealth addresses.\n * Wallets derived from another wallet (such as the identity wallets derived\n   from the profile wallet in the marketplace) can now be restored. This is\n   considered more of an advanced feature, but it does at least allow for a\n   wallet/identity generated via the marketplace, for example, to be restored\n   and for the user to regain access to their coins.\n * Show all wallets created: previously, the market-generated profile wallet was\n   hidden from the displayed wallets, which has been updated.\n * A new setting has been added to set the default ring size value used when\n   performing a transaction using anon balance. The ring size can still be\n   edited per transaction: this just allows for setting the initial/default\n   value used.\n * Updates the default ring size to 12 from 24.\n * Fixes an issue in using a very high inputs_per_sig value on anon related\n   transactions. This should also reduce the transaction fee slightly.\n * Updates the locked balance value displayed by using the new particl-core rpc\n   command getlockedbalances for this purpose. The previous means attempted to\n   calculate the locked balance but in some cases incorrectly included the wrong\n   values.\n * Fixes the displaying of the fee amount showing as the transferred amount for\n   conversion transactions in the transaction table (and also in the overview\n   page).\n * Adds checks to the zapping detail modal to ensure that addresses used during\n   zapping actually belong to the wallet. This is more of a preventative\n   measure.\n * Consolidates both of the wallet settings to split utxos for public\n   transactions and private transactions into a single \"default\" setting value.\n   The distinction between the two different settings was somewhat confusing.\n * The Send/Convert page now includes a control to allow for ease of splitting\n   the amount transacted into distinct utxos more easily. Having the control\n   only in the settings page made it tedious to use, and the control makes more\n   sense in the Send/Convert page, where it's most useful.\n\n> The default utxo split control in the wallet settings provides the\ninitial/default value for the control in the Send/Convert page.\n * The max value for the utxo splitting has been increased from 20 to 100 per\n   transaction.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop 3.1 is mostly a follow-up update to Particl Desktop 3.0. It\nimproves on the 3.0 user experience by fixing the most glaring issues and by\nintroducing some of the most-requested features from current marketplace\nvendors.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.2, on the other end, is expected to be more of a “standalone”\nrelease, meaning it won’t necessarily exclusively focus on improving the initial\n3.0 release but rather introduce new features and functionalities that bring a\nnew dimension to the experience.

These are generated for the profile and stored in the particl-market database. It's far better to allow the user to back these up and remove them from the database.</li></ul><blockquote>Note that each market identity generated derives from the profile wallet, so backing up the profile means that all identity wallets created from that profile are backed up as well.</blockquote><ul><li>Remove the logging out of the profile wallet mnemonic and passphrase.</li><li>Fixed sent listing image smsgs from leaking some information related to the sender's machine.</li><li>Fixed an issue with the market browser search ignoring various search criteria under certain cases.</li><li>When removing a market, particl-core is now correctly informed so as to stop receiving smsg for that market.</li><li>Reduced the ring size used in marketplace transactions involving anon funds (such as listing fees) from 24 to 12. This should assist with reducing fees slightly.</li><li>A number of smsg processing issues have been fixed: these should provide for greater stability in both the processing of received smsg, as well as the sending of smsg.</li><li>The settings page has been updated to better reflect the settings it contains.</li><li>Fixed an issue when generating a new identity where if the profile wallet was encrypted it failed to generate the new identity: a prompt for the profile wallet passphrase is now correctly presented.</li><li>Fixed an issue where some settings were incorrectly editable while the market service was starting up.</li><li>Invalid or missing values on the shipping source country in the product/template editor are now clearly displayed.

It improves on the 3.0 user experience by fixing the most glaring issues and by introducing some of the most-requested features from current marketplace vendors.</p><p>Particl Desktop 3.2, on the other end, is expected to be more of a “standalone” release, meaning it won’t necessarily exclusively focus on improving the initial 3.0 release but rather introduce new features and functionalities that bring a new dimension to the experience. We’ll provide more information about what items are planned to be included in the next update in a follow-up blog post that will be published to Particl News very shortly.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

These are\n   generated for the profile and stored in the particl-market database. It's far\n   better to allow the user to back these up and remove them from the database.\n\n> Note that each market identity generated derives from the profile wallet, so\nbacking up the profile means that all identity wallets created from that profile\nare backed up as well.\n * Remove the logging out of the profile wallet mnemonic and passphrase.\n * Fixed sent listing image smsgs from leaking some information related to the\n   sender's machine.\n * Fixed an issue with the market browser search ignoring various search\n   criteria under certain cases.\n * When removing a market, particl-core is now correctly informed so as to stop\n   receiving smsg for that market.\n * Reduced the ring size used in marketplace transactions involving anon funds\n   (such as listing fees) from 24 to 12. This should assist with reducing fees\n   slightly.\n * A number of smsg processing issues have been fixed: these should provide for\n   greater stability in both the processing of received smsg, as well as the\n   sending of smsg.\n * The settings page has been updated to better reflect the settings it\n   contains.\n * Fixed an issue when generating a new identity where if the profile wallet was\n   encrypted it failed to generate the new identity: a prompt for the profile\n   wallet passphrase is now correctly presented.\n * Fixed an issue where some settings were incorrectly editable while the market\n   service was starting up.\n * Invalid or missing values on the shipping source country in the\n   product/template editor are now clearly displayed. This field was often\n   missed when creating an item for sale, and so should now have greater\n   visibility when a value is missing.\n * The seller key has been added to the listings detail modal, as requested.\n * The promotion of a market using the incorrect market identity funds (in a\n   multi-identity setup) in some cases, has been fixed.\n * In the market browser, a count of new items received (but not yet displayed)\n   is shown alongside the refresh button.\n * Adds a button in the Settings page to allow for easy re-scanning of smsg\n   messages (rather than needing to manually run commands or use workarounds\n   such as joining a market to obtain the prompt to perform the re-scan).\n\n> Note that once a re-scan is performed, the button is disabled for a few minutes\nafterward: this is normal and allows some time for any message processing to\noccur.\n * Edits to pricing via the batch publish modal are now possible: a percentage\n   value can be set that will update the price of each item by the percentage\n   provided, or alternatively a fixed price can be set per item. Instead of\n   needing to update the price of each item individually prior to publishing, a\n   seller making use of the batch publish feature can now set the prices of\n   items in the batch publish modal.\n * Allow for the seller to specify escrow ratios:\n\n> This is available both via the user interface (in the product/template editor)\nas well as via the csv import (see the help text in the csv import wizard for\nfurther details).\n\nThese values can be viewed in the listings detail window.\n\nDo note that various warnings are presented both when viewing a listing's\ndetails as well as during purchasing/checkout of items to indicate when\nnon-standard escrow ratios are used.\n\nOrders also indicate the escrow ratios used by both parties to provide any\nadditional information that may be needed.\n * A button on each order is added to allow for the re-sending of the last\n   action performed by the user. This might help where the other party never\n   received the message (or some issue prevented the message from being\n   processed correctly), and causing the transaction to appear \"stuck\". The\n   workaround was typically to follow a set of instructions to manually perform\n   the resend... the button replaces the need to perform the manual steps.\n * Images can now be imported via the csv import file to add images when\n   creating initial products. Local paths as well as urls from the internet can\n   be used. See the help text in the csv import wizard for further details.\n\nWallet\n * Use existing stealth addresses when performing a balance transfer: this helps\n   to reduce the unnecessary generation of stealth addresses.\n * Wallets derived from another wallet (such as the identity wallets derived\n   from the profile wallet in the marketplace) can now be restored. This is\n   considered more of an advanced feature, but it does at least allow for a\n   wallet/identity generated via the marketplace, for example, to be restored\n   and for the user to regain access to their coins.\n * Show all wallets created: previously, the market-generated profile wallet was\n   hidden from the displayed wallets, which has been updated.\n * A new setting has been added to set the default ring size value used when\n   performing a transaction using anon balance. The ring size can still be\n   edited per transaction: this just allows for setting the initial/default\n   value used.\n * Updates the default ring size to 12 from 24.\n * Fixes an issue in using a very high inputs_per_sig value on anon related\n   transactions. This should also reduce the transaction fee slightly.\n * Updates the locked balance value displayed by using the new particl-core rpc\n   command getlockedbalances for this purpose. The previous means attempted to\n   calculate the locked balance but in some cases incorrectly included the wrong\n   values.\n * Fixes the displaying of the fee amount showing as the transferred amount for\n   conversion transactions in the transaction table (and also in the overview\n   page).\n * Adds checks to the zapping detail modal to ensure that addresses used during\n   zapping actually belong to the wallet. This is more of a preventative\n   measure.\n * Consolidates both of the wallet settings to split utxos for public\n   transactions and private transactions into a single \"default\" setting value.\n   The distinction between the two different settings was somewhat confusing.\n * The Send/Convert page now includes a control to allow for ease of splitting\n   the amount transacted into distinct utxos more easily. Having the control\n   only in the settings page made it tedious to use, and the control makes more\n   sense in the Send/Convert page, where it's most useful.\n\n> The default utxo split control in the wallet settings provides the\ninitial/default value for the control in the Send/Convert page.\n * The max value for the utxo splitting has been increased from 20 to 100 per\n   transaction.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop 3.1 is mostly a follow-up update to Particl Desktop 3.0. It\nimproves on the 3.0 user experience by fixing the most glaring issues and by\nintroducing some of the most-requested features from current marketplace\nvendors.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.2, on the other end, is expected to be more of a “standalone”\nrelease, meaning it won’t necessarily exclusively focus on improving the initial\n3.0 release but rather introduce new features and functionalities that bring a\nnew dimension to the experience. We’ll provide more information on the 3.2\ndeliverables as 3.1 goes live on mainnet.\n\nThanks for your time and help properly testing Particl Desktop 3.1; it ensures\neverything works as expected and speeds the mainnet deployment process. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This week, the focus has been on finalizing the last remaining\nitems for the release of Particl Desktop 3.1. \n\nWe can report that things went as expected and we'll be ready to deploy Particl\nDesktop 3.1 on testnet next week, barring any unforeseen issue.

This item is now mostly complete and is expected to be\n   fully wrapped up by Monday.\n * The usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace for better,\n   more customizable formatting. This task has already been started but has been\n   put on pause until other items were completed. Because other tasks have taken\n   a bit more time than expected, markdown formatting won't be included in the\n   coming testnet build, but might be included in the mainnet release. \n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap\nThis week, we've prepared Particl Core for the coming hardfork on the 1st of\nJanuary 2022 (testnet) and on the 1st of February 2022 (mainnet).

So see you all on Monday! Oh, right, it's time for our\nweekly development update first! ?\n\nThis week, most of the focus has been on adding a few key improvements to the\nmarketplace and desktop client after receiving various feedback from the\ncommunity. While these fixes may seem mundane to some, they fix relatively\nencumbering issues that affect both buyers and sellers in different cases. A few\nexamples of these improvements will be given in the Particl Desktop progress\nreport section of this blog post.\n\nAdditionally, we mentioned last week that, due to the larger-than-expected scope\nof adding digital items delivery, we were evaluating whether we'd include that\nfeature in Particl Desktop 3.1 or not. After looking at the situation, we've\nopted not to include it. \n\nA big reason for this decision is that Particl Desktop 3.1 now includes a lot of\nimportant and quality-of-life fixes and improvements over the initial mainnet\nrelease of Particl V3. Delaying their release would be counter-productive and\nunnecessary. Indeed, some of these fixes are relatively critical for some users,\nand so we're prioritizing releasing Particl Desktop 3.1 faster so that these\nusers can benefit from the fixes and gain back a better user experience.\n\nWith that in mind, we've started planning ahead for the release of Particl\nDesktop 3.1 on testnet. We're finalizing the last few remaining items planned\nfor 3.1 and will then build a testnet client for community testing. We'll\ncommunicate more details on the testnet release in next week's progress report.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Development Progress\nIn the intro of this progress report, we've mentioned that several improvements\nhave been added to Particl Desktop, notably relating to Particl Marketplace.\n\nFor example, we've added a shortcut in the Send/Convert page to split a\ntransaction into multiple outputs, which should make it more visible as well as\neasier to set on a transaction-per-transaction basis. This has been a\nmuch-requested improvement by some of our vendors as it previously caused them\nsome issues, especially concerning the process of publishing listings.\n\nAlso, if something goes wrong during a transaction and one party does not\nreceive an updated order status from the other party (which means their client\ndidn't properly pick up the intended SMSG message), that other party can now\nsimply press a button that's been added to the order flow which conveniently\nallows for their last action status to be rebroadcast. It was possible to do\njust that in the past, but it required commands to be entered manually in the\nconsole window; a less-than-ideal user experience. This isn't needed anymore and\ncan be accomplished with the simple click of a button.\n\nSimilar to the item above, another button has been added. This one rescans SMSG\nmessages (executes the smsgscanbuckets command) for you, so in the case where it\nmight appear that an SMSG message was unproperly received, you can just click on\nthat button so that your client tries to find and process the message.\n\nAnother small change that was added is the display of a count of new listings\nthat are not yet displayed in the market browser. Previously, an alert indicator\nwould be displayed over the refresh button; this is still there but now a count\nof how many new items have been received is also displayed near the refresh\nbutton.\n\nAside from these, a variety of bug fixes and general improvements have been\nadded, as is usual, making this week one that ended up being quite productive\nand helpful in improving the general user experience.\n\nWith all of that being said, here's the list of remaining items to be included\nin Particl Desktop 3.1.\n\n * Several features related to better vendor inventory import/update. We can\n   report that the ability to batch update prices to multiple listings at once \n   is now complete, but has received various bug fixes and improvements this\n   week. The addition of a product code and the ability to import images\n   directly through the CSV file is still in progress and is expected to be\n   wrapped up next week.\n * The usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace for better,\n   more customizable formatting. This task has already been started but has been\n   put on pause until the above item is completed. It is expected to resume next\n   week or so and is also expected to be wrapped up relatively quickly.\n * Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address\n   requirement (i.e., download links, crypto addresses for NFTs, user codes,\n   etc.). While this task has seen some progress since it was started, it will\n   not be included in Particl Desktop 3.1 and is pushed for later on. \n\nKeeping the listed items above in mind, we will be starting the process of\nbuilding and releasing Particl Desktop 3.1 on testnet very soon. \n\nAs always, we'd rather not give a precise date or estimate for its release, but\nwe hope to begin the process towards the end of next week. We'll give you more\naccurate details on this in next week's progress report.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Report\nThis week, Particl's Core Developer, Tecnovert, has focused mostly on Particl\nCore and on preparing the upcoming hardfork.\n\nIndeed, Particl Core 0.21.2.5 has been pre-released a couple of days ago and you\ncan now download and install it by following this link\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.5].

Indeed, on the 1st of February 2022 at 17:00 UTC, the\nParticl blockchain will hardfork and include a variety of new features,\nincluding Taproot activation.\n\nWe'll make a formal announcement on the hardfork next week and will include in\nit all the necessary details about it. We'll also publish in that blog post a\ncomplete list of the new features and changes it will introduce.\n\nPlease note that, if you still have disabled outputs as a result of the\nemergency hardfork that happened earlier this year, you will need to submit your\nclaim to have them re-activated before the hardfork. Failure to do so means\nyou'll need to wait for the next, subsequent hardfork to have your outputs\nre-activated. To learn more about how to submit your claim, please refer to\nthis\nblog post [https://particl.news/output-claim-process-is-live/].\n\nAside from that, there have been some minor improvements made to BasicSwap's\nunderlying protocol, notably around its UI and the use of RingCT/CT swaps. We\nare still working towards launching the Open Beta soon and will give more\ndetailed information on this as soon as we can.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe'd like to thank you, as always, for your passion, dedication, and various\ncontributions to the Particl project.

This week has been one where we've focused on\nfixing a tricky issue with Particl Marketplace and have been exploring how best\nto release Particl Desktop 3.1.\n\nIndeed, an issue was brought to our attention in which some listing messages are\nnot being received by some markets. The problem seems to be related to two\nseparate issues, but both can occur at the same time. Out of these two issues,\none is already fixed but we are still busy investigating the second one\nespecially as it seems to deal with the way the marketplace validates the\nincoming listing messages and, for some reason, appears to be working on some\nmachines correctly but not on others. This makes tracking, and more importantly,\ntesting the problematic code a little trickier than expected. We are looking\ninto this and should have it fixed fairly soon.\n\nAs far as the progression regarding the delivery of digital items goes, there's\nbeen a number of stumbling blocks in getting this working properly. Indeed, it\nnow appears that it will require significantly more time than expected since it\ntouches on many more components of both Particl Desktop and the marketplace\nback-end code.\n\nIn other words, we cannot currently give any estimation yet on when this might\nbe ready and, for this reason, we've begun exploring releasing Particl Desktop\n3.1 without that feature. In fact, we do not want to drag the release of Particl\nDesktop 3.1 for too long. After releasing Particl V3 on mainnet, we've opted to\ngo ahead with more frequent releases and we intend on sticking to that\ncommitment. \n\nThat being said, even without digital items delivery being included in the next\nParticl Desktop update, we'll see the introduction of a few new features as well\nas a large number of bug/issue fixes and general improvements. Among them, we\ncan count on the addition of a seller-adjustable escrow ratio and various\nimportant seller-focused improvements, notably many new options for importing\ninventories and editing, in bulk, listing prices. The vast majority of these\nadditions have been suggested by Particl Marketplace sellers themselves and\nshould fix some of the most obvious pain points for them.\n\nAs we are giving a final look at what is still required to add the digital items\ndelivery feature, we'll let you know, in next week's progress report, whether\nwe've decided to release V3.1 with or without it. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Report\n * Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address\n   requirement (i.e., download links, crypto addresses for NFTs, user codes,\n   etc.). This task is in progress but is proving to be much more time-consuming\n   than initially expected. For this reason, we may de-prioritize this task in\n   favour of the other two and release Particl Desktop 3.1 without it. We will\n   be able to confirm if that is the case next week.\n * Several features related to better vendor inventory import/update. We can\n   report that the ability to batch update prices to multiple listings at once \n   is now complete, but has received various bug fixes and improvements this\n   week.

This week, we've got some exciting new feature to announce\nwhich is going to be part of the upcoming Particl Desktop update (3.1). And\nnobody expected it this soon! ?\n\nIndeed, Particl Desktop developer Arnold Bansemer initially started the week\nfocusing on adding alternative delivery methods for digital items. Upon looking\nat the code, he stumbled onto something interesting.\n\nIf you recall correctly, one of the current roadmap items is the ability to\nadjust the value of the escrow security deposit. It is also one of the top\nrequests we've received both from vendors and non-vendors following the release\nof Particl V3 on mainnet. As it turns out, due to the new, improved codebase\nintroduced by Particl V3, adding this feature ended up being a relatively easy\nand quick task to do.\n\nAs a result, we are happy to confirm that the \"adjustable escrow\" roadmap item\nis now complete and merged into the Particl Desktop code, meaning that it'll be\nactivated on the very next update (3.1). \n\nAt this time, custom ratios (0% to 100% of the value of the item being\npurchased) can only be decided by the seller at the time of creating a listing.\nTo ensure unaware users aren't met with bad surprises, any listing containing\ncustom ratios will clearly indicate it, and buyers will be forced to manually\ncheck a box confirming that they are aware of the custom ratios before checking\nout their cart.\n\nAdjustable Escrow Preview (UI WIP)Now let's have a look at the progress made on\nthe other items.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Report\nBecause the majority of the week has been spent on integrating the adjustable\nescrow feature, the previously stated Particl Desktop \"to-do\" list has remained\nmore or less the same, with a few minor exceptions.\n\n * Several features related to better vendor inventory import/update. We can\n   report that the ability to batch update prices to multiple listings at once\n   is now completed. The addition of a product code and the ability to import\n   images directly through the CSV file directly is still in progress, however,\n   we're now moving these two tasks for AFTER the completion of the enabling of\n   digital items. Both of these items are relatively easy to wrap up and we'd\n   rather focus on the more complicated task first.\n * Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address\n   requirement (i.e., download links, NFTs, user codes, etc.). This task has\n   been started this week and will be the primary focus for next week.\n * The usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace for better,\n   more customizable formatting. This task has already been started but has been\n   put on pause until the above items are completed. It is estimated that this\n   item will be completed very quickly once its development resumes.\n\nParticl Core Progress Report\nThis week on Core, work has gone towards keeping Particl Core up-to-date with\nBitcoin's codebase.
