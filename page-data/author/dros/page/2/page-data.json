It is a\nnew major feature that allows you and anyone else to create an unlimited number\nof markets or storefronts on the Particl network and manage an unlimited number\nof identities across any of these markets through user profiles. It essentially\ntransforms Particl from a marketplace to a network of infinite marketplaces and\nseller shops.\n\nMarket Management is the biggest marketplace update ever since it launched on\nmainnet in August 2019 and will be one of the biggest building blocks of the\nentire Particl eCommerce protocol. The changes and meaning it brings to Particl\nwill shape the marketplace into a unique and powerful marketplace protocol and\nopen up endless possibilities.\n\nThe release of Market Management on mainnet will be a huge milestone in\nParticl’s lifecycle, but it will also mark the beginning of a new and exciting\n“development era” focused on making adoption of the platform as easy as\npossible. That much will be reflected in Particl’s upcoming roadmap update,\nwhich more details can be found in the last section of this Development Update.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDevelopment Update\nThis major Particl Desktop update will also introduce a few other improvements\nwhich will be explained in this Development Update. Without further ado, let’s\njump right into it!\n\nMarket Management\nThe team is still busy implementing Market Management. Most of the required work\nhas already been completed on the marketplace codebase side of things, and the\nteam is now putting the final touches on the flagging and blacklisting functions\nfor user markets and storefronts. Just like for listings, this governance\nmechanism is required for the community to be able to protect itself from\nundesirable content and vote it out. And it will behave just like when flagging\na listing too! When a certain market or storefront reaches a certain negative\nvoting threshold, it will get delisted off of the client.\n\nFollowing this, the new code will need to go through various integration tests\nto ensure it is secure and without bugs, after which the first testnet build\nwill be released for community testing.\n\nIdentities and User Profiles\nMarket Management also introduces a brand new concept — Identity Management. In\nfact, each market will be able to be created using any identity and sellers will\nbe able to manage an unlimited number of them spread across an unlimited number\nof markets through the user of user profiles.\n\nThis new marketplace function is already completed in the codebase and is now\nawaiting the completion of the remaining Market Management components before the\nintegration process can be finalized and properly tested.\n\nSMSG Network\nDue to the new changes brought forth by Market Management, the SMSG network will\nalso need a few tweaks to ensure that messages are carried properly between\ndifferent markets, storefronts, as well as the “open market”.\n\nThe required modifications are currently being worked in at this moment.\n\nSearch Function Improvements\nAnother set of improvements coming up has to do with the search function of the\nmarketplace. This is yet again due to the scope of the changes caused by Market\nManagement, as the search function will now need to be able to properly search\nfor items across different markets/storefronts. A few minor improvements to the\nsearch function will also be added to the next Particl Desktop update, which\nwill be followed by more significant improvements and additions (i.e. sort by,\nfilters, etc) in future updates.\n\nThis improvement is still being worked on at the moment and should be completed\nsoon as well.\n\nGUI and UI/UX Changes\nAs can be expected, Market Management is going to introduce a lot of changes to\nParticl Desktop’s user interface and experience. That’s because the Market\nManagement feature fundamentally changes the very nature of Particl’s\nmarketplace from a single marketplace to an entire network of marketplaces and\nseller shops.\n\nWhat that means is that, once Market Management goes live, Particl Desktop might\nlook and feel a bit different than what you’re used to. The team is still busy\npreparing the GUI for the full Market Management and user profile integrations.\n\nVisible and Accessible When First Starting the Application\nOne of the obvious changes that eventually needed to be done on Particl Desktop\nis the ability to easily start buying and selling on the marketplace without\nhaving to go through the hassle of manually creating a second wallet named\nMarket. To that effect, the team is currently integrating that function into\nParticl Desktop and it will be bundled in with the upcoming Market Management\nupdate.\n\nHow the new process will look like will work is as follow:\n\n * Users who already have a Market wallet activated will see their wallet be\n   automatically converted to fit the new marketplace structure. There is no\n   additional step to convert your Market wallet into the new marketplace\n   structure other than updating Particl Desktop.\n * Users who install Particl Desktop for the first time and looking to use the\n   marketplace will be presented with a new setup process that is clear and\n   visible and will allow the user to create both the default wallet and a\n   Market wallet at the same time.\n\nThis new way of accessing the marketplace will make it much easier for everyone\nto get started with Particl’s marketplace.\n\nGeneral Performance Improvements\nWith all of the above being said, let’s not forget that the next Particl Desktop\nupdate will also introduce several performance improvements. That’s because this\nupdate touches a majority of the marketplace codebase and refactors it with more\nefficient and “mature” processes.\n\nThe sum of all the minor improvements applied here and there will be translated\nin Particl Desktop being a little lighter and faster than it currently is. The\nmarketplace should also be even smoother to use.\n\nPerformance improvements to the marketplace and the Particl Desktop client are\ntypical whenever a new version of Particl Desktop is released, but this\nparticular update should see a relatively-more-significant-than-usual\nperformance boost.\n\nETA?\nIt is difficult to give a proper ETA for the delivery of Market Management as\nintegration tests are pretty much unpredictable and can take a shorter or longer\ntime to complete depending on the results. The very good news, though, is that\nmost of the code is now completed on the codebase level and that we are just\nabout to embark into the integration/testing phase.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpcoming 2020 Roadmap Update\nThe Particl team is also working on its new 2020 Development Roadmap which will\nbe heavily focused on the adoption of the marketplace. As Market Management is\nreleased, it will mark the end of a significant development sprint and the\nbeginning of a new one. The release of the new roadmap will be the cornerstone\nof this new phase of development.\n\nAn ETA until its release cannot be stated just yet, but it really won’t be long\nanymore. The team is currently evaluating many roadmap items and setting up the\npriorities as well as the roadmap structure before publishing it to the public.\nOne thing is certain, it’s that the new roadmap will be pretty exciting as the\nmarketplace becomes more and more mature and easy to use. This is where it gets\nvery interesting as “new user retention” becomes much better!\n\nYou can expect a few articles to be posted on Particl.news within a few days,\nwhich will eventually lead to the 2020 roadmap unveiling! As always, stay tuned\nfor more updates! ?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Development-Update--09-01-20-/1-d6f-78STDDExgcque1uOgA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"market-management-and-major-particl-desktop-upgrade-\">Market Management and Major Particl Desktop Upgrade ?</h3><p>As most of you already know by now, the Particl team is working on a pretty major update to Particl Desktop and its marketplace — Market Management.

To eliminate the obstacles\nstanding in the way of Particl’s marketplace adoption, the team has been on a\nvery focused path to deliver a whole range of key features that would make the\nOpen Marketplace user-friendly enough to be considered “adoption-ready” by, in\nthe first place, the crypto community, and then by wider audiences not\nnecessarily in crypto.\n\nChoose a Market While Browsing Listings (WIP, Subject to Change)The Particl team\nis excited to announce that the Market Management functionality will be the next\nbig marketplace feature and is likely to be part of Particl Desktop 2.4.0.\n\n> Note: The information and graphic designs shown in this blog post are still in\nprogress and subject to change.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Content (Market Management Section)\n * What’s “Market Management”?\n * Seller Profile and Identities\n * Market Browser\n * Create a New Market or Storefront\n * Promote a Market\n * Market Governance\n * Market Management Development Status\n * What’s Next After Market Management?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Road Towards a Better Marketplace Adoption\nParticl has been onto a journey to eliminate the obstacles in the way of\nParticl’s adoption. With this very focused objective in mind, developers have\nbeen hard at work to bring forward the key features required before the Open\nMarketplace becomes “adoption-ready”. And things have been moving pretty fast!\n\nBitcoin to be Accepted on Particl\nIn-wallet Bitcoin Exchange (Mainnet Screenshot)On November 1st, Particl announced the upcoming integration of an in-wallet\nexchange module [https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190359593550901248] \nto make it super easy for shoppers to buy anything on the marketplace using\nBitcoin. In fact, this new feature is so close to being released that the\nParticl team members flying out to the Slush Helsinki conference have brought\nwith them private builds of the Open Marketplace, on mainnet, WITH the Bitcoin\nexchange module included\n[https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1197137822261665792]. Additionally,\nsince earlier today, the build that they have brought with them is also\navailable on testnet\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.0] for everyone to\nplay with.\n\nThis new exchange module, made possible thanks to a brand new SMSG-powered bot\nintegrated right into Particl Desktop, also marks the first step towards\nincluding many more currencies on Particl’s Open Marketplace. This is a critical\nfeature that will allow almost any cryptocurrency user to be able to shop\nonline, on Particl, without fees and without putting any of their personal\ninformation or data at risk. Just swap your coins for Particl right from Particl\nDesktop!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMarket Management is Next!\nThe Particl team is taking no time in between major feature releases and is now\nworking on the final integration tweaks required for the Market Management\nfeature to be ready. This major Particl feature will drastically change how the\nOpen Marketplace is interacted with and open up a ton of possibilities for\nsellers and buyers both.\n\nWhat’s “Market Management”?\nMarket Management is a new tool that significantly changes how Particl’s\nmarketplace behaves and is interacted with. It is, simply put, an added\nfunctionality that allows anyone to create public or private user markets and\nstorefronts. Whereas Particl’s Open Marketplace used to be the only Particl\nmarketplace available, it will now be one out of an infinite amount of user\nmarkets or storefronts that anyone can create. It will, however, remain as the\ndefault marketplace, meaning anyone installing Particl Desktop will have access\nto and see this giant public marketplace.\n\n> For the purpose of this article, “markets and storefronts” will simply be\nreferred to as “markets”.\nWhile the above section quickly describes the new Market Management capabilities\nof Particl’s marketplace, you probably want to know more about what’s coming up,\nright?. In fact, Market Management required quite a bit of refactoring (updating\nthe code and changing parts of its structure), and so with its introductions\ncomes a vast amount of new features and UI/UX changes.\n\n> Let’s walk through the main components of what makes up Market Management.\nSeller Profiles and Identities\nSeller profiles and identities are one of the most important changes brought\nforth by Market Management and is a completely new concept being introduced.\n\nSeller profiles, identities, and market in short…The seller profile: A seller profile represents one user on the marketplace and\nmany profiles can be set up on the same Particl Desktop client. It can be\nconnected to multiple markets or storefronts at once and be used to create an\ninfinite number of markets. Each time the profile connects to a market or\ncreates one, it associates an identity to it that is then used to transact. A\nseller profile can contain an infinite amount of identities, if desired.\n\nIdentities: Identities are essentially Particl wallets. An identity’s public key\nis used to view markets, purchase products on them, and moderate its content\nwhile the private key is used to list products on them and process orders. A\nprofile can have multiple identities and easily choose which identity is used to\ncreate a market.\n\nIdentities can be used to associate different markets with the same seller. That\ncan either be a good thing for sellers looking to build up a solid reputation or\nexpose their branding to different markets, but for those looking for the\nmaximum level of privacy, it is recommended to use a different identity every\ntime you create a new market. It is not possible to tie different identities\ntogether nor is it possible to associate identities with their seller profile.\n\nTo sum it up, a seller profile represents one “real-world” online seller. This\nseller can connect to and create an infinite amount of markets and storefronts.\nEach market can be independently connected to an infinite amount of identities\nwhich cannot be traced back to the main seller profile.\n\n> Note: Seller profiles will mostly be a back-end function for the first version\nof Market Management, meaning they won’t really be visible from inside the\nwallet.\nMarket Browser\nAnother huge component of the Market Management tool is the Market Browser — a\ncompletely new section of Particl Desktop where you can browse, join, manage,\nflag, and promote markets. This is the central point of command of the Market\nManagement tool and is separated into three distinct categories.\n\nMarket Browser (WIP, subject to change)Available Markets: The Available tab of the Market Browser displays all publicly\navailable markets. In other words, it gives you quick access to all the markets\nthat have been either publicly listed or promoted on the Market Browser. The\nAvailable tab is also the place where you can manually connect to markets and\nstorefronts not publicly listed on the Market Browser by entering their Market\nID. It also gives you the Market ID of all available markets it displays so that\nyou can easily share them with other people.\n\nJoined Markets: The Joined tab is where all markets and storefronts that you\nhave joined can be accessed. Here, you can browse, promote, or report markets\nwith a few simple clicks, and also join any market by entering its access code\n(the “Market ID”).\n\nYour markets: The Your Markets tab is where you can browse, manage, and promote\nmarkets created or administered by you. This section is also where you want to\ngo if you want to create a brand market of your own.\n\nCreate a New Market or Storefront\nCreate a New Market (WIP, Subject to Change)Market Management gives you the\nability to create or join an unlimited number of markets and personalize them by\nchoosing a logo, title, and description so that other people know what they’ll\nfind in it. These markets are pretty flexible and have their own parameters and\npermissions that can be set up by the creator at the moment of creation. Put\nsimply, markets can be either be publicly listed or not, and also either be a\nregular market or storefront with attributable administrator rights.\n\nPublicly listed or not? Markets on Particl can either be publicly listed on the\nMarket Browser or not. By default, new markets aren’t listed on the Market\nBrowser, making them known and accessible only by those who know its access code\n(the “Market ID”) and uses it to connect their Particl Desktop client to it.\nWhen a market isn’t listed on the Market Browser, it is impossible for anyone\nthat doesn’t know the access code to even know it exists in the first place. To\nbe publicly listed on the Market Browser and be accessible to anyone running\nParticl, a market has to be “listed”, for a small market listing/promotion fee\nthat is then redistributed to stakers.\n\nA “public” market refers to a market that has been listed on the Market Browser\nby its creator. That means anyone running Particl Desktop can easily find public\nmarkets just by browsing the list of publicly available markets and without\nhaving to know its access code (“Market ID”).\n\nMarket or Storefront? When creating a market, it is possible to set it up as two\ndifferent types — either a regular, “open” market or a storefront. These two\ntypes of markets are actually very similar, the only difference being that\nanyone who has joined a market can publish listings and and sell products\nwhereas only the creator of a storefront, and its administrators, can do it.\n\nIn fact, storefronts are basically shops that any seller or group of sellers can\nset up. Only the seller that sets up a storefront, and the ones that have been\ngiven the rights to sell by the creator, can list products and process orders.\nFor more precision, while any seller with the rights to sell on a storefront can\npublish listings on it, they will only be able to process orders for items that\nthey have posted themselves. Sellers cannot, at least for the first version of\nMarket Management, process orders on behalf of other sellers of a given\nstorefront.\n\nStorefronts are how businesses and brands can set up their own stores,\npersonalize them, and get vetted sellers to publish listings on them. They are\nalso ideal for seller/buyer communities to form around a specific market.\n\nJust like with markets, storefronts can either be publicly listed on the Market\nBrowser or not.\n\nPromote a Market\nPromoting a market lists it on top of the Market Browser and adds a “promoted”\nicon next to it. Anyone with access to a certain market can promote it by paying\na small promotion fee that is then redistributed, in full, to stakers of the\nParticl network.\n\nMarket Governance\nEvery market or storefront on Particl is subject to the exact same user\ngovernance mechanism as the listings are. That means anyone with access to a\nmarket can report it as inappropriate so that it can get taken off Particl when\ntoo many people report it.\n\nMarket Management Development Status\nThe marketplace development team is just about to wrap up the back-end code of\nthe Market Management as well as the test cases required to make sure everything\nis smooth. These are expected to be completed shortly after the Slush Helsinki\nconference. Then, the team will begin the GUI integration and run that last few\ntests before releasing the feature on testnet. Stay ready!\n\n> Note: Some Market Management functions and UI/UX may change during the GUI\nintegration and end up looking different than what has been displayed in this\nblog post.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Next?\nMarket Management is getting closer to be ready, so it’s normal to wonder what\nare going to be the next major pieces to come on Particl after it. Here are two\nof the most immediate items on the team’s list, but know that more may be added\nsoon and that smaller items may be worked on in parallel.\n\nInventory Management\nPreview of Preliminary Inventory Management Designs (WIP, Subject to Change)The\nInventory Management tool is one of the next big pieces planned to be added to\nthe marketplace after Market Management. This will add quantity and inventory\nmanagement capabilities to Particl Desktop and give sellers the ability to sell\npre-determined amounts of items.\n\nOn the buyer side, it will also allow shoppers to buy the same listing multiple\ntimes without requiring the seller to create new listings.\n\nInventory Management is also expected to bring in a live environment some of the\nfirst OMP Library functions required for listings to have custom fields (i.e.\nchoosing the colour or size of a shirt right from the listing).\n\nAdjustable Escrow\nAnother key feature required to make seller adoption way easier is the ability\nto adjust the escrow rate. Right now, when buying an item, both the seller and\nthe buyer need to temporarily lock in escrow a security deposit equal to 100% of\nthe value of the item being purchased.\n\nWith an adjustable escrow, sellers could require the buyer to only put 10% of\nthe value of the item being purchased, for example. They could also set up the\nescrow with a 0% rate, meaning neither the buyer nor the seller would be\nrequired to temporarily lock any funds in escrow.\n\nA lower escrow rate takes out some of the game-theory involved in the double\ndeposit escrow system. An escrow rate of 0% takes it off entirely. This is far\nfrom ideal when purchasing from a seller that you don’t know, don’t trust, or\nthat has a shaky or disputed reputation.\n\nFor sellers with a solid reputation or customer base though, they might not need\nthe escrow, or even want it, as it requires them to constantly lock up funds for\neach sale. Furthermore, big and trusted brands might be more trusted by their\ncustomers then untrusted, meaning locking up funds in escrow may be something\ncustomers would like to bypass as well.\n\nLet’s take a very simple and obvious example: Apple. If Apple were to sell\nproducts on Particl, they probably wouldn’t want to deal with the escrow. They\nhave a large customer base that trusts them and they would fix any potential\nissue the same way they would usually do it. After all, a big brand like Apple\nselling on Particl would still need to follow the regular seller guidelines and\nconsumer protection policies of their respective jurisdiction, so in that\nspecific case, the escrow only ends up being an obstacle to adoption for Apprle\nand not a real benefit for any of the two transacting parties (Apple and the\ncustomer).\n\nIt is also being discussed that the escrow might be eventually made optional and\nthat you could opt-out of it when creating a listing. Taking the escrow out\nentirely of a transaction, and not just setting it up to 0%, would have the\nadded benefit of taking out a few steps of the buy flow, simplifying the process\nof buying and selling something on Particl and making possible something like\nautomatic processing and delivery of digital items.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is alive and kicking, and there’s no stopping it! As we head into 2020,\nyou’ll start getting used to more constant and faster releases, almost all of\nthem bringing new features and noticeable improvements.\n\nAs always, the team appreciates any help it can get, whether it’s through\ncommunity testing, functionality/feature suggestions, or just general feedback\nof the user experience of the Particl platform. Every single bit helps! It is by\ncollecting as many different perspectives and points of view that the\nmarketplace will get better. If you encounter any issue or have feedback for the\ndevelopers, never hesitate to log an issue on Github by clicking on the “Report\na bug” icon at the bottom left of the Particl Desktop client, or simply by\nfollowing this link: https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues. This is\nthe simplest way to voice your opinion and a sure way for you to make sure the\ndevelopers will see it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Market-Management-is-Next-/1-HD9QKfTUuqqxOx30CYDCBg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"create-and-join-an-unlimited-number-of-markets-\">Create and Join an Unlimited Number of Markets ?</h3><p>The Particl team is moving fast and methodically!

It is, simply put, <strong>an added functionality that allows anyone to create public or private user markets and storefronts.</strong> Whereas Particl’s Open Marketplace used to be the only Particl marketplace available,<strong> it will now be one out of an infinite amount of user markets or storefronts that anyone can create</strong>. It will, however, remain as the default marketplace, meaning anyone installing Particl Desktop will have access to and see this giant public marketplace.</p><blockquote>For the purpose of this article, “markets and storefronts” will simply be referred to as “markets”.</blockquote><p>While the above section quickly describes the new Market Management capabilities of Particl’s marketplace, you probably want to know more about what’s coming up, right?. In fact, Market Management required quite a bit of refactoring (updating the code and changing parts of its structure), and so with its introductions comes a vast amount of new features and UI/UX changes.</p><blockquote>Let’s walk through the main components of what makes up Market Management.</blockquote><h3 id=\"seller-profiles-and-identities\">Seller Profiles and Identities</h3><p>Seller profiles and identities are one of the most important changes brought forth by Market Management and is a completely new concept being introduced.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Market-Management-is-Next-/1-C66uBOkpLRs_j0H7ytHaJQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Seller profiles, identities, and market in short…</figcaption></figure><p><strong>The seller profile:</strong> A seller profile represents one user on the marketplace and many profiles can be set up on the same Particl Desktop client. It can be connected to multiple markets or storefronts at once and be used to create an infinite number of markets. Each time the profile connects to a market or creates one, it associates an identity to it that is then used to transact. A seller profile can contain an infinite amount of identities, if desired.</p><p><strong>Identities:</strong> Identities are essentially Particl wallets. An identity’s public key is used to view markets, purchase products on them, and moderate its content while the private key is used to list products on them and process orders. A profile can have multiple identities and easily choose which identity is used to create a market.</p><p>Identities can be used to associate different markets with the same seller. That can either be a good thing for sellers looking to build up a solid reputation or expose their branding to different markets, but for those looking for the maximum level of privacy, it is recommended to use a different identity every time you create a new market. It is not possible to tie different identities together nor is it possible to associate identities with their seller profile.</p><p><strong>To sum it up</strong>, a seller profile represents one “real-world” online seller. This seller can connect to and create an infinite amount of markets and storefronts. Each market can be independently connected to an infinite amount of identities which cannot be traced back to the main seller profile.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Seller profiles will mostly be a back-end function for the first version of Market Management, meaning they won’t really be visible from inside the wallet.</blockquote><h3 id=\"market-browser\">Market Browser</h3><p>Another huge component of the Market Management tool is the Market Browser — a completely new section of Particl Desktop where you can browse, join, manage, flag, and promote markets. This is the central point of command of the Market Management tool and is separated into three distinct categories.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Market-Management-is-Next-/1-K0kMclqwOPZkJo5ffunCGg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Market Browser (WIP, subject to change)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Available Markets:</strong> The Available tab of the Market Browser displays all publicly available markets. In other words, it gives you quick access to all the markets that have been either publicly listed or promoted on the Market Browser. The Available tab is also the place where you can manually connect to markets and storefronts not publicly listed on the Market Browser by entering their Market ID. It also gives you the Market ID of all available markets it displays so that you can easily share them with other people.</p><p><strong>Joined Markets: </strong>The Joined tab is where all markets and storefronts that you have joined can be accessed. Here, you can browse, promote, or report markets with a few simple clicks, and also join any market by entering its access code (the “Market ID”).</p><p><strong>Your markets:</strong> The Your Markets tab is where you can browse, manage, and promote markets created or administered by you. This section is also where you want to go if you want to create a brand market of your own.</p><h3 id=\"create-a-new-market-or-storefront\">Create a New Market or Storefront</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Market-Management-is-Next-/1-6HRfeYPykMHYnb46Bu_gXQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Create a New Market (WIP, Subject to Change)</figcaption></figure><p>Market Management gives you the ability to create or join an unlimited number of markets and personalize them by choosing a logo, title, and description so that other people know what they’ll find in it. These markets are pretty flexible and have their own parameters and permissions that can be set up by the creator at the moment of creation. Put simply, markets can be either be publicly listed or not, and also either be a regular market or storefront with attributable administrator rights.</p><p><strong>Publicly listed or not? </strong>Markets on Particl can either be publicly listed on the Market Browser or not. By default, new markets aren’t listed on the Market Browser, making them known and accessible only by those who know its access code (the “Market ID”) and uses it to connect their Particl Desktop client to it. When a market isn’t listed on the Market Browser, it is impossible for anyone that doesn’t know the access code to even know it exists in the first place. To be publicly listed on the Market Browser and be accessible to anyone running Particl, a market has to be “listed”, <strong>for a small market listing/promotion fee that is then redistributed to stakers.</strong></p><p>A <strong>“public”</strong> market refers to a market that has been listed on the Market Browser by its creator. That means anyone running Particl Desktop can easily find public markets just by browsing the list of publicly available markets and without having to know its access code (“Market ID”).</p><p><strong>Market or Storefront?</strong> When creating a market, it is possible to set it up as two different types — either a regular, “open” market or a storefront. These two types of markets are actually very similar, the only difference being that anyone who has joined a market can publish listings and and sell products whereas only the creator of a storefront, and its administrators, can do it.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Market-Management-is-Next-/1-bvwUL0TWSKaQ6ba9V7dCNg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>In fact, <strong>storefronts </strong>are basically shops that any seller or group of sellers can set up. Only the seller that sets up a storefront, and the ones that have been given the rights to sell by the creator, can list products and process orders. For more precision, while any seller with the rights to sell on a storefront can publish listings on it, they will only be able to process orders for items that they have posted themselves. Sellers cannot, at least for the first version of Market Management, process orders on behalf of other sellers of a given storefront.</p><p>Storefronts are how businesses and brands can set up their own stores, personalize them, and get vetted sellers to publish listings on them. They are also ideal for seller/buyer communities to form around a specific market.</p><p>Just like with markets, storefronts can either be publicly listed on the Market Browser or not.</p><h3 id=\"promote-a-market\">Promote a Market</h3><p>Promoting a market lists it on top of the Market Browser and adds a “promoted” icon next to it. Anyone with access to a certain market can promote it by paying a small promotion fee that is then redistributed, in full, to stakers of the Particl network.</p><h3 id=\"market-governance\">Market Governance</h3><p>Every market or storefront on Particl is subject to the exact same user governance mechanism as the listings are. That means anyone with access to a market can report it as inappropriate so that it can get taken off Particl when too many people report it.</p><h3 id=\"market-management-development-status\">Market Management Development Status</h3><p>The marketplace development team is just about to wrap up the back-end code of the Market Management as well as the test cases required to make sure everything is smooth. These are expected to be completed shortly after the Slush Helsinki conference. Then, the team will begin the GUI integration and run that last few tests before releasing the feature on testnet. Stay ready!</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Some Market Management functions and UI/UX may change during the GUI integration and end up looking different than what has been displayed in this blog post.</blockquote><hr><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s Next?</h2><p>Market Management is getting closer to be ready, so it’s normal to wonder what are going to be the next major pieces to come on Particl after it. Here are two of the most immediate items on the team’s list, but know that more may be added soon and that smaller items may be worked on in parallel.</p><h3 id=\"inventory-management\">Inventory Management</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Market-Management-is-Next-/1-knGEEEDMYRZ-yVxf3Uf8Ww.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Preview of Preliminary Inventory Management Designs (WIP, Subject to Change)</figcaption></figure><p>The Inventory Management tool is one of the next big pieces planned to be added to the marketplace after Market Management. This will add quantity and inventory management capabilities to Particl Desktop and give sellers the ability to sell pre-determined amounts of items.</p><p>On the buyer side, it will also allow shoppers to buy the same listing multiple times without requiring the seller to create new listings.</p><p>Inventory Management is also expected to bring in a live environment some of the first OMP Library functions required for listings to have custom fields (i.e. choosing the colour or size of a shirt right from the listing).</p><h3 id=\"adjustable-escrow\">Adjustable Escrow</h3><p>Another key feature required to make seller adoption way easier is the ability to adjust the escrow rate. Right now, when buying an item, both the seller and the buyer need to temporarily lock in escrow a security deposit equal to 100% of the value of the item being purchased.</p><p>With an adjustable escrow, sellers could require the buyer to only put 10% of the value of the item being purchased, for example. They could also set up the escrow with a 0% rate, meaning neither the buyer nor the seller would be required to temporarily lock any funds in escrow.</p><p>A lower escrow rate takes out some of the game-theory involved in the double deposit escrow system. An escrow rate of 0% takes it off entirely. This is far from ideal when purchasing from a seller that you don’t know, don’t trust, or that has a shaky or disputed reputation.</p><p>For sellers with a solid reputation or customer base though, they might not need the escrow, or even want it, as it requires them to constantly lock up funds for each sale. Furthermore, big and trusted brands might be more trusted by their customers then untrusted, meaning locking up funds in escrow may be something customers would like to bypass as well.</p><p>Let’s take a very simple and obvious example: Apple. If Apple were to sell products on Particl, they probably wouldn’t want to deal with the escrow. They have a large customer base that trusts them and they would fix any potential issue the same way they would usually do it. After all, a big brand like Apple selling on Particl would still need to follow the regular seller guidelines and consumer protection policies of their respective jurisdiction, so in that specific case, the escrow only ends up being an obstacle to adoption for Apprle and not a real benefit for any of the two transacting parties (Apple and the customer).</p><p>It is also being discussed that the escrow might be eventually made optional and that you could opt-out of it when creating a listing. Taking the escrow out entirely of a transaction, and not just setting it up to 0%, would have the added benefit of taking out a few steps of the buy flow, simplifying the process of buying and selling something on Particl and making possible something like automatic processing and delivery of digital items.</p><hr><p>Particl is alive and kicking, and there’s no stopping it! As we head into 2020, you’ll start getting used to more constant and faster releases, almost all of them bringing new features and noticeable improvements.</p><p>As always, the team appreciates any help it can get, whether it’s through community testing, functionality/feature suggestions, or just general feedback of the user experience of the Particl platform. Every single bit helps! It is by collecting as many different perspectives and points of view that the marketplace will get better.

Woods is\na veteran with more than 18 years of experience in the technical and payment\nindustries. He brings extensive expertise and reach within the retail and\nconsumer markets and will pro-actively work in bridging the gap between the\ntraditional finance sector and cryptocurrency.\n\nMr. Woods will advise Particl on the opportunities to disrupt the fintech\nindustry that are currently being opened up by distributed technologies and how\nbest to capitalize on them. In addition, Woods will actively work on realizing\nthese opportunities by tapping right into his vast network of merchants and\nbusinesses and connect them with Particl for its world-class technologies and\ndecentralized services.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Case for Connecting Fintech Businesses to Particl\nMany businesses, like tech companies operating outside the cryptocurrency\nindustry but actively looking to modernize and optimize their business flow, can\nbenefit from Particl’s range of decentralized services. For example, a business\nmay simply want to accept cryptocurrency payments, but another may also need to\ntransfer data securely and privately, without third-party custody of the data.\nIn that case, they could use Particl’s peer-to-peer data storage network called\nSMSG and integrate it into their model.\n\nOnline retailers, who constantly need to lower their costs or worry about the\nprivacy and security of their data may want to open shop and sell products on\nParticl’s decentralized and private-by-default marketplace. After all, it\ncharges no commission! Other companies may only have a need for Particl’s double\ndeposit escrow system to keep certain parties in check with each other.\n\n> “Through his many years working right in the heart of the payment industry,\nBryan has developed lasting relationships with many businesses that are\ncurrently looking for ways to implement distributed technologies.Bryan will be\nworking closely with Particl to advise on the exact needs and requirements of\nthese companies and actively help onboarding them with Particl’s wide array of\ndecentralized services.” —Gerlof van Ek, Co-Founder at Particl\n\nIn fact, most businesses have surprisingly high levels of inefficiencies. This\ncosts them profits, time, and opportunities. Some of these hurdles are caused by\nhuman activity, regulations, politics, but some of them are also caused by\ntechnological bottlenecks. Coincidentally, it appears that more and more\nbusinesses realize the potential that distributed technologies present (P2P,\nblockchain). Of course, most of them would never dare, nor need to, go “full\ncrypto”, but just the right amount of distributed technology at the right place\nwithin their operations can make all the difference.\n\nThis shift of mentality within the traditional finance industry is opening up a\nlot of doors, and this is the opportunity that Bryan Woods wants to seize, with\nParticl.\n\n> Note: While Particl has already met and been introduced to some businesses\nwithin Bryan’s network, it may still take some time until the first few\nimplementations are ready and deployed. It is not impossible that the first few\ndeployments will occur in early 2020, as opposed to 2019. As always, follow\nParticl.news to not miss any update!\nLeveraging Spend.com’s Technology\nThe coming of Bryan as an advisor also opens up many interplay opportunities\nbetween both Spend and Particl’s ecosystems.\n\nSpend is a next-generation banking ecosystem with tens of thousands of active\nusers. It acts as a fiat gateway and “banking services 2.0\" provider. Its\nall-in-one mobile application allows you to hold, transfer, deposit, and\nwithdraw multiple cryptocurrencies and fiat (currently only USD and CAD) without\nrequiring a bank. Spend also makes spending very easy through its different\nSpend Visa payment card options that automatically and instantly converts any\ncurrency enabled for card payments into the currency requested by the merchant.\nFurther down the line, it is also intended for Spend App to include many other\nservices, such as loans, interest, and even a full-blown merchant or marketplace\nintegration. The end goal for Spend is to keep all the financial activities of\nits users within the Spend App itself. Think of it as the ultimate banking\napplication.\n\nIn addition to connecting Particl and other businesses together, Bryan and his\nteam at Spend will actively explore, along with the Particl team, how both\nprojects can synergize together to push the adoption of distributed technologies\nand cryptocurrencies to a wider audience.\n\nOn one hand, Spend.com offers a full suite of gateway and payment services that\ncan help onboard people to the Particl platform much more effectively. These\nservices include the near-instant and cost-effective swap of currencies, fiat on\nand off-ramps, Visa payment cards, and etc.\n\nOn the other hand, the multiple decentralized services produced by the Particl\nteam can allow Spend’s ecosystem to blossom into a powerful application that\nseamlessly combines the traditional banking industry and distributed\ntechnologies, making the adoption of new users into alternative banking and\ncryptocurrencies much easier than ever.\n\nA Methodical & Strategic Approach to Increasing Particl’s Stability\nBy integrating Particl’s decentralized services into other businesses, an\nincreased number of transactions is expected to occur on the native Particl\nblockchain and on the markets, providing the entire network and its various\napplications (i.e. Particl’s decentralized marketplace) with more privacy,\nliquidity, and stability.\n\nIt is important to highlight that this new strategic relationship between Bryan\nWoods and the Particl team marks the official beginning of a long-term and very\nstrategic play to take the banking and eCommerce worlds through the next\nevolutionary hop. As a result, to ensure the trading markets can absorb the new\ninflux of activity caused by businesses integrating Particl services,\nintegrations will be deployed methodically, one by one, in a way that ensures\nmarket stability. Over time, each added integration will contribute to\nincreasing the overall liquidity of the markets, making it easier to deploy more\nintegrations and more services at a much faster pace.\n\nParticl’s First Few Steps Towards a Comprehensive SDK\nFor Particl, this phase also marks a very important milestone. These are the\nfirst few steps towards building and packaging a comprehensive developer SDK. \nThe process of building integrations for third-parties will give the team a\nbrand new perspective on what components are the most critical for developers\nlooking forward to using a Particl SDK and will considerably speed up the\nprocess of finalizing and releasing it. In a way, the team will have to go\nthrough some of the same steps developers will go through when using the SDK, so\nhighlighting needs and issues should be much quicker.\n\nSuch integrations will demonstrate that with a bit of creativity, blockchain\ntechnology and cryptocurrencies can offer very practical and disruptive\nsolutions to some of the most pressing issues present within the traditional\nbanking, payment, and eCommerce systems.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout Bryan Woods\n> Bryan has more than 18 years of experience in the technical and payment\nindustries.

As you probably already know, the team initiated its \nParticl World Tour [https://particl.news/particl-world-tour-2019-f6e3d3c7e09c] \nby first going to the United States and attend 3 different conferences —\nMoney2020 [https://us.money2020.com/], WCC [https://worldcryptocon.com/], and \nSFBW’s Epicenter [https://sfblockchainweek.io/].\n\nIt’s safe to say that, throughout this first part of the Particl World Tour, the\nteam has made tremendous progress on all fronts and has been able to collect a\nsignificant amount of feedback, advice, contacts, and most importantly, new\nfriends taking part, just like the team, in this ambitious blockchain journey!\nAlong the way, Particl met with tech evangelists, developers, capital funds,\nbusiness owners, market makers, innovators, and was even able to scoop a new\nadvisor [https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190348538498019329], Bryan\nWoods [https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-woods-3243a1167] (Spend.com\n[https://spend.com]’s President) to assist and support the project in making the\nbest out of the many opportunities currently opening up within the payment and\neCommerce industries. The team had the blessing of being accompanied, for most\nof the trip, by Crypto PR Lab, a San Francisco-based PR firm that has grown\ncloser to the team ever since meeting for the first time at Consensus 2019.\nTheir insight, reach, and contacts within the local SF blockchain community have\nproven to be an invaluable asset for the entire duration of the trip.\n\nFor this first part of the Particl World Tour, the team split into different\ngroups and spread out on the US West Coast (San Francisco & Las Vegas) to cover\nmultiple events and maximize results. This strategy allowed to cover a lot of\nground at once and has brought very valuable connections that could then be best\nleveraged by the fact that the whole team ended up meeting as one for SFBW’s\nEpicenter. It doesn’t happen all the time that so many team members get to meet,\nin-person, and so the strategy was to optimize this precious opportunity and get\nthe most done out of it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSan Francisco\nWhile a portion of the team was in Vegas for Money2020 and WCC, another portion\nwas already in San Francisco for the start of the San Francisco Blockchain Week.\nEpicenter, the week’s main and last event, is where Particl held a booth for two\ndays as well as a 30-minute talk. But in no way was it the only event of\ninterest!\n\nThe city was literally buzzing about blockchain and the many events attracted\nthe entirety of the local, but very front running, San Francisco-based\ncryptocurrency community. It really felt home! Let’s not forget San Francisco\nand the Bay Area, in general, is the homeland of startups and the heart of the\ntech industry. People from all around the world join together with the hopes of\ncreating the next new groundbreaking technology or project. Particl fits very\nmuch within that innovation-focused and very forward-thinking mindset.\n\nSFBW’s particular type of schedule (having the main event at the very end of the\nweek) proved to be an excellent opportunity for the team to initiate the first\npoints of contact with multiple key people by attending many of the side-events\nand evening receptions organized all throughout the week. Then, during the two\ndays of Epicenter, came the opportunities to capitalize on these contacts made\nduring the week by demonstrating the marketplace and have more quality time with\nthese people.\n\nBefore Epicenter, the Particl team attended CESC, the San Francisco Blockchain\nWeek’s kickoff event where it set up a table at the location to improvise a\nquick Particl booth with a couple of computers running the Open Marketplace. As\nis now usual, the marketplace really impressed and gained great reactions and\ninterest which brought new pairs of eyes on Particl and made new friends around,\nlike the stand-up guys over at Cracking Crypto\n[https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto],\n[https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto] for example.\n\nDr. Kap Giving an Interview to the Cracking Crypto ShowThe team also attended\nmore than a dozen side-events (most of the time, many a night…who needs sleep?)\nall throughout the week such as receptions organized by Polychain Capital,\nPantera Capital, Outliers Ventures, Starfish Network, eToro, Huobi, OceanEx, and\nmore. The connections established at all these events really did set the state\nfor when everybody would be crossing paths again later at Epicenter.\n\nLas Vegas\nAnd so while a portion of the team was in San Francisco for the start of SFBW,\nJoe Fisher and Cryptoguard were in Las Vegas, to attend Money2020\n[https://us.money2020.com/] and the World Crypto Conference (WCC)\n[https://worldcryptocon.com/].\n\nParticl Welcomes Bryan Woods, Spend.com’s President, as New AdvisorAt Money2020 [https://us.money2020.com/], a Fintech conference focused on\ninnovations within the payment industry, the focus was entirely on sealing the\ndeal with a new advisor, Bryan Woods, President at Spend.com. Spend.com is a\nteam that has been growing closer to the Particl team ever since meeting at the\nConsensus 2019 booth in New York City.\n\nThe Particl team spent 2 full days working at Spend.com’s booth (one of the big\nsponsors of Money2020) to discuss and work on various strategies moving into\n2020. This is a direct follow-up to another in-person trip the team made earlier\nin October 2019 to meet up with Spend.com. Meeting once again, at Money2020,\nallowed both teams to initiate and walk the first steps of a long-term\nrelationship together. More details will follow this coming Thursday in a blog\npost published on Particl.news. Definitely stay tuned!\n\nSpecial shoutout to Nicholas Merten [https://twitter.com/Nicholas_Merten], aka \nDataDash [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCatR7nWbYrkVXdxXb4cGXw], which the\nteam had the pleasure to cross paths with at Money2020. His focus, dedication,\nand projects to help cryptocurrencies move further along the path to mainstream\nadoption really impressed!\n\nNicholas Merten, aka Datadash, hanging out with ParticlThen, after Money2020,\nCryptoguard flew to join the rest of the team in San Francisco while Joe Fisher\nstayed an additional day in Vegas to take part in the WCC conference\n[https://worldcryptocon.com/].\n\nWCC was the perfect occasion to meet with some of the people the team had been\nlooking forward to meetup with again and yet another quality event to make the\nfirst points of contact with various people. Indeed, just like SFBW, WCC\nattracted a quality crowd as well as many leaders within the blockchain\nindustry, some of which couldn’t make it to SFBW. In that scenario, splitting\nthe team into two different cities really reaped a lot of benefits for Particl.\n\nJoe Fisher and Masha Prusakova at WCC 2019Epicenter — SFBW’s Main Event\nAnd then came Epicenter [https://sfblockchainweek.io/], the main event of the\nSan Francisco Blockchain Week. The Particl team all met as one the day before\nand came to the conference as a gold sponsor, had a booth right next to the main\nentrance, and gave a 30-minute talk on the Industry Stage.\n\nParticl Team Showing Off the Open Marketplace at SFBW’s EpicenterJust like\nthroughout the first part of the week, the reactions at the booth were\noverwhelmingly good and, maybe strangely enough, people still looked surprised\nthat a fully decentralized and no compromise blockchain project is already live\nand looking so good, even to this day. This is the typical feedback Particl has\nbeen receiving ever since it started going to more events this year.\n\nEpicenter’s crowd was definitely smaller than Consensus, but it was much more\nfocused and in “business mode”. The reason for this is actually important to\nunderstand. The people who still remain in blockchain after a more than\ntwo-year-long bear market and keep attending these kinds of events are the true\npioneers that will propel the next blockchain wave. They are the people fighting\nin the trenches, against all odds, to make sure the blockchain revolution will\none day catch up on the mainstream level.\n\nAnd in San Francisco, of all places, a place renowned for how many tech\ninnovations it generates every year. The people attending these conferences\ndon’t look at the industry with a narrow-minded view. No, they instead know the\nlong-term potential of these groundbreaking technologies and are the ones that\nare making it happen.\n\nThis is actually the main reason Particl wanted to attend SFBW. The team knew\nthe potential of this local blockchain community, thanks in part to attending\nthe SF-based Bitcoin2019\n[https://particl.news/particl-in-san-francisco-bitcoin2019-571fe31fe396] \nconference earlier in the year, and knew it would be a perfectly receptive and\nexcited crowd.\n\n, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman at Blockchain Research InstituteAnd the team\nwas right! Particl had the opportunity to spend some high-quality time with\nthought leaders and experts from many different industries and received many\nadvice and resources. For example, the Particl team had the chance to meet with \nDon Tapscott, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman at Blockchain Research Institute\n[https://www.blockchainresearchinstitute.org/], and earn 30 minutes of his time\njust before flying out to Europe.\n\nIndeed, just like with Don Tapscott, many similar breakout meetings, sit-downs,\nand evening-long discussions happened with several key people working on pushing\nblockchain forward. The team met with media, capital firms, lawyers, developers,\nbusiness developers, the inventor of eGift cards, and even a guy that can solve\na Rubics cube blindfolded, but more importantly, made many new friends on the\nway that are as passionate and dedicated to see cryptocurrencies succeed.\n\nThe team also had a 30-minute speaking slot on the Industry Stage and sent Dr.\nKap on stage. Some of the people the team has met throughout the week attended\nthe talk which further helped them understand the project’s vision and\nintentions. The official presentation video will be published within a few days\nby the SFBW organizers. In the meantime, you can check out Dr. Kap’s\npresentation on Particl’s Youtube channel.\n\n> The upload originally is a Periscope\n[https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB] \n[https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB]video\n[https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB] taken by Particl’s Community\nManager, Guillaume Benayoun. You can check out more video of the team in San\nFrancisco by browsing Ben’s Periscope uploads here: \nhttps://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1jMJgwZoNjWJL?t=1s\nThe team used the exposure and momentum provided by a full week of intensive\nnetworking to announce to major pieces of news that will help propel the project\nforward —an in-wallet integration of a Bitcoin exchange module\n[https://particl.news/particl-announces-bitcoin-exchange-integration-into-particl-desktop-e7c0940c0b4d] \nand the official beginning of an intimate and long-term relationship with\nSpend.com [https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190348538498019329]. Bryan\nWoods, Spend.com’s President, was announced at the same time as a new advisor to\nthe project.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTakeaways\nThink of this whole US West Coast trip as a giant, never-ending brainstorming\nsession with not only team members, but advisors, leaders, and experts from many\ndifferent industries hungry to see any solid blockchain tech succeed.\n\nThe Particl Team Debriefing Post-SFBWThe people the team met get it. They get\nthe potential of blockchain and Particl both. They want to see the industry\nsucceed and the products powered by blockchain land in the hands of everyday\npeople.\n\nWhile the team already knew about the quality of the Particl platform, it is now\ncrystal clear from all the feedback received that the Particl ecosystem and its\nOpen Marketplace is very advanced in terms of tech compared to almost any other\nend-user-focused blockchain product. The vision, mission, and disruptive\npotential of such a platform is also a shared feeling within all of the people\nmet during this trip.\n\nBut getting this product into people’s hands is equally important, if not more. \nThe best product in the world serves no purpose if it is not being used by\nanyone. This trip provided the team with a lot of resources, connections, and\noffers that will help Particl jump in with two feet into this new\nadoption-focused phase the project is headed to.\n\nThe team has been able to discuss, in detail and with valuable outside\nperspectives, the next steps moving into 2020. What’s coming next in 2020 will\nbe very methodical and carefully planned, and it’s all about getting that\nadoption going. Thanks to this US West Coast trip, the team is now equipped with\nthe best resources it could have hoped for at the best time imaginable. Let’s do\nthis! ?\n\nWhat’s Next?\nThe development team has been focused on the next few items, as identified a\nwhile ago\n[https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b]\n, required before aggressive adoption strategies can start getting a worthy\nconversion rate. Indeed, the Open Marketplace and Particl Desktop still lack a\nfew features the team would like to have before actively trying to drive users\nto the marketplace.\n\nIn the meantime, the communications and strategy team is now embarking in a new\nphase to start the onboarding of users as soon as the platform is ready for\nadoption. The team will be taking part in various internal workshops in Berlin\nin the coming weeks along with key connections and advisors made throughout the\npast two weeks. That’s to craft strategies related to the user adoption of the\nOpen Marketplace and the Particl network in general and help the project pivot\ntowards a a more “business” focused phase in the most efficient manner possible.\n\nIt is very clear, the team is coming back from this US West Coast trip extremely\nmotivated and hungry for success. A lot of doors are opening up, on all fronts,\ndirectly to Particl and also to the blockchain industry itself. The world is\nreceptive to the idea of blockchain technology but cautious due to this\nnow-very-long bear market. It is why the next steps of the way need to be very\nmethodological to seize the most of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\n\nParticl Team After Epicenter’s ClosureAs you might start to understand simply by\nreading this post, this trip marks the beginning of brand new objectives,\nchallenges, and goals for the project. Think of it as the “war room phase”, the\nmoment where strategies are made and carefully, methodically set in motion.\n\nNext Locations of the Particl World Tour\nWith that in mind, the team is going to be attending, in a smaller capacity, two\nadditional events and then conclude it’s already very worthy Particl World Tour.\n\nIndeed, you’ll be able to find Particl at Blockshow Asia\n[https://blockshow.com/], in Singapore, and Slush Helsinki\n[https://www.slush.org/events/helsinki/], in Finland.\n\nAt Blockshow Asia, the same boots-on-the-grounds approach as used during SFBW’s\nside-events and WCC will be applied. It will be all about establishing the first\npoints of contact and reconvening with key people within the Asian market to get\nas much insight as possible. Don’t forget, as mentioned in a previous blog post\n[https://particl.news/particl-in-singapore-consensus-asia-a3be041d315e] on\nParticl.news, Singapore is a place of interest for Particl because of new tax\nregulations being proposed which would make any sale paid for with\ncryptocurrencies a tax-free event. It is a direct use-case for buying and\nselling using cryptocurrencies and a great opportunity for Particl to shine\nbrightly. This is, quite simply, crypto having a clear shot at going mainstream\nin Singapore…\n\nAt Slush Helsinki, a tech startup/founder focused conference, the team will be\noperating a booth and meeting up with various advisors and mentors specifically\ngoing to the event to help out motivated, young entrepreneurs. The team will\nconsist of Juha Kovanen (Marketplace Lead Developer), Gerlof van Ek (Lead\nDesigner, Developer), Dr. Kapil Amarasinghe (UK Particl Ambassador), and Gloria\n(Particl’s Communications & Strategy Team).\n\nBoth these events will allow Particl to receive even more feedback, advice, and\nresources as it jumps right into its next phase. The timing of it all couldn’t\nbe better!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou, Too, Can Be a Part of it!\nThe best connections happen face-to-face, this is simply how things happen in\nthe space. The people you meet, in-person, by going to conferences and their\nrelated side-events are not the same crypto people you meet online. These are\nthe active and focused people working day and night on the blockchain\nrevolution. They are the ones that make it all happen!\n\nFor this reason, the Particl team very strongly encourages you to go out there\nand attend your local blockchain events. Crypto is not dead, it’s alive and\nkicking in a way that might surprise you! The bear market is making innovators\nmore motivated and hungry for success, a feeling that is not always shared by\nthe “online crypto community”. Go out there, meet people face-to-face, and be\nright in the middle of the biggest revolution of our times (with no hyperbole\nadded here ?).\n\nAfter all, meeting other crypto fans and innovators to change the world is just\none part of why you should attend these events. The other part is…well, it is so\nmuch FUN! Dare try it just once and you’ll be hooked!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStay tuned for more news about Spend.com’s relationship with Particl this coming\nThursday, the 14th of November. Then, on the 21st of November, Particl will be\nhaving another surprise announcement!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-fg-rxBVAgcC3I7WZpZR3dA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"recap-dr-kap-s-own-video-recap-of-the-events-\">Recap + Dr. Kap’s Own Video Recap of the Events ?</h3><p>The Particl team is finally back home from its US West Coast trip and hot damn was it an eventful week! As you probably already know, the team initiated its <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-world-tour-2019-f6e3d3c7e09c\"><strong>Particl World Tour</strong></a> by first going to the United States and attend 3 different conferences —<a href=\"https://us.money2020.com/\"><strong> Money2020</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://worldcryptocon.com/\"><strong>WCC</strong></a>, and<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://sfblockchainweek.io/\"><strong>SFBW’s Epicenter</strong></a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fB1yf5CaXHI\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>It’s safe to say that, throughout this first part of the Particl World Tour, the team has made tremendous progress on all fronts and has been able to collect a significant amount of feedback, advice, contacts, and most importantly, new friends taking part, just like the team, in this ambitious blockchain journey! Along the way, Particl met with tech evangelists, developers, capital funds, business owners, market makers, innovators, and was even able to scoop a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190348538498019329\"><strong>new advisor</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-woods-3243a1167\"><strong>Bryan Woods</strong></a> (<a href=\"https://spend.com\"><strong>Spend.com</strong></a>’s President) to assist and support the project in making the best out of the many opportunities currently opening up within the payment and eCommerce industries. <strong>The team had the blessing of being accompanied, for most of the trip, by Crypto PR Lab, a San Francisco-based PR firm</strong> that has grown closer to the team ever since meeting for the first time at Consensus 2019. Their insight, reach, and contacts within the local SF blockchain community have proven to be an invaluable asset for the entire duration of the trip.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JXnJg_HTXI8?feature=oembed\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>For this first part of the Particl World Tour, <strong>the team split into different groups and spread out on the US West Coast</strong> (San Francisco &amp; Las Vegas) to cover multiple events and maximize results. This strategy allowed to cover a lot of ground at once and has brought very valuable connections that could then be best leveraged by the fact that the whole team ended up meeting as one for SFBW’s Epicenter. It doesn’t happen all the time that so many team members get to meet, in-person, and so the strategy was to optimize this precious opportunity and get the most done out of it.</p><hr><h2 id=\"san-francisco\">San Francisco</h2><p>While a portion of the team was in Vegas for Money2020 and WCC, another portion was already in San Francisco for the start of the San Francisco Blockchain Week. Epicenter, the week’s main and last event, is where Particl held a booth for two days as well as a 30-minute talk. But in no way was it the only event of interest!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-AQI1srPnv0aVadXpHrS-YQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>The city was literally buzzing about blockchain and the many events attracted the entirety of the local, but very front running, San Francisco-based cryptocurrency community. It really felt home! Let’s not forget San Francisco and the Bay Area, in general, is the homeland of startups and the heart of the tech industry. People from all around the world join together with the hopes of creating the next new groundbreaking technology or project. Particl fits very much within that innovation-focused and very forward-thinking mindset.</p><p>SFBW’s particular type of schedule (having the main event at the very end of the week) proved to be an excellent opportunity for the team to initiate the first points of contact with multiple key people by attending many of the side-events and evening receptions organized all throughout the week. Then, during the two days of Epicenter, came the opportunities to capitalize on these contacts made during the week by demonstrating the marketplace and have more quality time with these people.</p><p>Before Epicenter, the Particl team attended CESC, the San Francisco Blockchain Week’s kickoff event where it set up a table at the location to improvise a quick Particl booth with a couple of computers running the Open Marketplace. As is now usual, the marketplace really impressed and gained great reactions and interest which brought new pairs of eyes on Particl and made new friends around, like the stand-up guys over at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto\"><strong>Cracking Crypto</strong></a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto\">,</a> for example.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-1s_bWqb9sJ0nOJzAx_jmyA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Dr. Kap Giving an Interview to the Cracking Crypto Show</figcaption></figure><p>The team also attended more than a dozen side-events (most of the time, many a night…who needs sleep?) all throughout the week such as receptions organized by Polychain Capital, Pantera Capital, Outliers Ventures, Starfish Network, eToro, Huobi, OceanEx, and more. The connections established at all these events really did set the state for when everybody would be crossing paths again later at Epicenter.</p><h2 id=\"las-vegas\">Las Vegas</h2><p>And so while a portion of the team was in San Francisco for the start of SFBW, Joe Fisher and Cryptoguard were in Las Vegas, to attend <a href=\"https://us.money2020.com/\"><strong>Money2020</strong></a> and the <a href=\"https://worldcryptocon.com/\"><strong>World Crypto Conference (WCC)</strong></a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-0D0gVZM4ldY_H1DLZBPlyw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl Welcomes Bryan Woods, Spend.com’s President, as New Advisor</figcaption></figure><p>At <a href=\"https://us.money2020.com/\">Money2020</a>, a Fintech conference focused on innovations within the payment industry, the focus was entirely on <strong>sealing the deal with a new advisor, Bryan Woods, President at Spend.com.</strong> Spend.com is a team that has been growing closer to the Particl team ever since meeting at the Consensus 2019 booth in New York City.</p><p><strong>The Particl team spent 2 full days working at Spend.com’s booth</strong> (one of the big sponsors of Money2020) to discuss and work on various strategies moving into 2020. <strong>This is a direct follow-up to another in-person trip the team made earlier in October 2019 to meet up with Spend.com.</strong> Meeting once again, at Money2020, allowed both teams to initiate and walk the first steps of a long-term relationship together. More details will follow this coming Thursday in a blog post published on Particl.news. Definitely stay tuned!</p><p>Special shoutout to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nicholas_Merten\"><strong>Nicholas Merten</strong></a>, aka <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCatR7nWbYrkVXdxXb4cGXw\"><strong>DataDash</strong></a>, which the team had the pleasure to cross paths with at Money2020. His focus, dedication, and projects to help cryptocurrencies move further along the path to mainstream adoption really impressed!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-nQDXMaDJpFACqsgG28IwAw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Nicholas Merten, aka Datadash, hanging out with Particl</figcaption></figure><p>Then, after Money2020, Cryptoguard flew to join the rest of the team in San Francisco while Joe Fisher stayed an additional day in Vegas to take part in the <a href=\"https://worldcryptocon.com/\">WCC conference</a>.</p><p>WCC was the perfect occasion to meet with some of the people the team had been looking forward to meetup with again and yet another quality event to make the first points of contact with various people. Indeed, just like SFBW, WCC attracted a quality crowd as well as many leaders within the blockchain industry, some of which couldn’t make it to SFBW. In that scenario, splitting the team into two different cities really reaped a lot of benefits for Particl.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-oOCQxSc4XZuiiGtoCW04Iw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Joe Fisher and Masha Prusakova at WCC 2019</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"epicenter-sfbw-s-main-event\">Epicenter — SFBW’s Main Event</h2><p>And then came <a href=\"https://sfblockchainweek.io/\"><strong>Epicenter</strong></a>, the main event of the San Francisco Blockchain Week. The Particl team all met as one the day before and came to the conference as a gold sponsor, had a booth right next to the main entrance, and gave a 30-minute talk on the Industry Stage.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-sh0iU5S6N1qmWjpI_stjWw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl Team Showing Off the Open Marketplace at SFBW’s Epicenter</figcaption></figure><p>Just like throughout the first part of the week, the reactions at the booth were overwhelmingly good and, maybe strangely enough, people still looked surprised that a fully decentralized and no compromise blockchain project is already live and looking so good, even to this day. This is the typical feedback Particl has been receiving ever since it started going to more events this year.</p><p>Epicenter’s crowd was definitely smaller than Consensus, but it was much more focused and in “business mode”. The reason for this is actually important to understand. <strong>The people who still remain in blockchain after a more than two-year-long bear market and keep attending these kinds of events are the true pioneers that will propel the next blockchain wave.</strong> They are the people fighting in the trenches, against all odds, to make sure the blockchain revolution will one day catch up on the mainstream level.</p><p>And in San Francisco, of all places, a place renowned for how many tech innovations it generates every year. The people attending these conferences don’t look at the industry with a narrow-minded view. No, they instead know the long-term potential of these groundbreaking technologies and are the ones that are making it happen.</p><p>This is actually the main reason Particl wanted to attend SFBW. The team knew the potential of this local blockchain community, <strong>thanks in part to attending the SF-based </strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-in-san-francisco-bitcoin2019-571fe31fe396\"><strong>Bitcoin2019</strong></a><strong> conference earlier in the year</strong>, and knew it would be a perfectly receptive and excited crowd.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-y1kyfpZ9pREc31ZUZG5RuA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman at Blockchain Research Institute</figcaption></figure><p>And the team was right! Particl had the opportunity to spend some high-quality time with thought leaders and experts from many different industries and received many advice and resources. For example, the Particl team had the chance to meet with <strong>Don Tapscott, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman at </strong><a href=\"https://www.blockchainresearchinstitute.org/\"><strong>Blockchain Research Institute</strong></a>, and earn 30 minutes of his time just before flying out to Europe.</p><p>Indeed, just like with Don Tapscott, many similar breakout meetings, sit-downs, and evening-long discussions happened with several key people working on pushing blockchain forward. The team met with media, capital firms, lawyers, developers, business developers, the inventor of eGift cards, and even a guy that can solve a Rubics cube blindfolded, but more importantly, made many new friends on the way that are as passionate and dedicated to see cryptocurrencies succeed.</p><p>The team also had a 30-minute speaking slot on the Industry Stage and sent Dr. Kap on stage. Some of the people the team has met throughout the week attended the talk which further helped them understand the project’s vision and intentions. The official presentation video will be published within a few days by the SFBW organizers. In the meantime, you can check out Dr. Kap’s presentation on Particl’s Youtube channel.</p><blockquote>The upload originally is a <a href=\"https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB\"><strong>Periscope</strong></a><a href=\"https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB\"><strong>video</strong></a><strong> </strong>taken by Particl’s Community Manager, Guillaume Benayoun.

As you probably already know, the team initiated its <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-world-tour-2019-f6e3d3c7e09c\"><strong>Particl World Tour</strong></a> by first going to the United States and attend 3 different conferences —<a href=\"https://us.money2020.com/\"><strong> Money2020</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://worldcryptocon.com/\"><strong>WCC</strong></a>, and<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://sfblockchainweek.io/\"><strong>SFBW’s Epicenter</strong></a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fB1yf5CaXHI\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>It’s safe to say that, throughout this first part of the Particl World Tour, the team has made tremendous progress on all fronts and has been able to collect a significant amount of feedback, advice, contacts, and most importantly, new friends taking part, just like the team, in this ambitious blockchain journey! Along the way, Particl met with tech evangelists, developers, capital funds, business owners, market makers, innovators, and was even able to scoop a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190348538498019329\"><strong>new advisor</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-woods-3243a1167\"><strong>Bryan Woods</strong></a> (<a href=\"https://spend.com\"><strong>Spend.com</strong></a>’s President) to assist and support the project in making the best out of the many opportunities currently opening up within the payment and eCommerce industries. <strong>The team had the blessing of being accompanied, for most of the trip, by Crypto PR Lab, a San Francisco-based PR firm</strong> that has grown closer to the team ever since meeting for the first time at Consensus 2019. Their insight, reach, and contacts within the local SF blockchain community have proven to be an invaluable asset for the entire duration of the trip.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JXnJg_HTXI8?feature=oembed\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>For this first part of the Particl World Tour, <strong>the team split into different groups and spread out on the US West Coast</strong> (San Francisco &#x26; Las Vegas) to cover multiple events and maximize results. This strategy allowed to cover a lot of ground at once and has brought very valuable connections that could then be best leveraged by the fact that the whole team ended up meeting as one for SFBW’s Epicenter. It doesn’t happen all the time that so many team members get to meet, in-person, and so the strategy was to optimize this precious opportunity and get the most done out of it.</p><hr><h2 id=\"san-francisco\">San Francisco</h2><p>While a portion of the team was in Vegas for Money2020 and WCC, another portion was already in San Francisco for the start of the San Francisco Blockchain Week. Epicenter, the week’s main and last event, is where Particl held a booth for two days as well as a 30-minute talk. But in no way was it the only event of interest!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-AQI1srPnv0aVadXpHrS-YQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>The city was literally buzzing about blockchain and the many events attracted the entirety of the local, but very front running, San Francisco-based cryptocurrency community. It really felt home! Let’s not forget San Francisco and the Bay Area, in general, is the homeland of startups and the heart of the tech industry. People from all around the world join together with the hopes of creating the next new groundbreaking technology or project. Particl fits very much within that innovation-focused and very forward-thinking mindset.</p><p>SFBW’s particular type of schedule (having the main event at the very end of the week) proved to be an excellent opportunity for the team to initiate the first points of contact with multiple key people by attending many of the side-events and evening receptions organized all throughout the week. Then, during the two days of Epicenter, came the opportunities to capitalize on these contacts made during the week by demonstrating the marketplace and have more quality time with these people.</p><p>Before Epicenter, the Particl team attended CESC, the San Francisco Blockchain Week’s kickoff event where it set up a table at the location to improvise a quick Particl booth with a couple of computers running the Open Marketplace. As is now usual, the marketplace really impressed and gained great reactions and interest which brought new pairs of eyes on Particl and made new friends around, like the stand-up guys over at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto\"><strong>Cracking Crypto</strong></a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto\">,</a> for example.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-1s_bWqb9sJ0nOJzAx_jmyA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Dr. Kap Giving an Interview to the Cracking Crypto Show</figcaption></figure><p>The team also attended more than a dozen side-events (most of the time, many a night…who needs sleep?) all throughout the week such as receptions organized by Polychain Capital, Pantera Capital, Outliers Ventures, Starfish Network, eToro, Huobi, OceanEx, and more. The connections established at all these events really did set the state for when everybody would be crossing paths again later at Epicenter.</p><h2 id=\"las-vegas\">Las Vegas</h2><p>And so while a portion of the team was in San Francisco for the start of SFBW, Joe Fisher and Cryptoguard were in Las Vegas, to attend <a href=\"https://us.money2020.com/\"><strong>Money2020</strong></a> and the <a href=\"https://worldcryptocon.com/\"><strong>World Crypto Conference (WCC)</strong></a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-0D0gVZM4ldY_H1DLZBPlyw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl Welcomes Bryan Woods, Spend.com’s President, as New Advisor</figcaption></figure><p>At <a href=\"https://us.money2020.com/\">Money2020</a>, a Fintech conference focused on innovations within the payment industry, the focus was entirely on <strong>sealing the deal with a new advisor, Bryan Woods, President at Spend.com.</strong> Spend.com is a team that has been growing closer to the Particl team ever since meeting at the Consensus 2019 booth in New York City.</p><p><strong>The Particl team spent 2 full days working at Spend.com’s booth</strong> (one of the big sponsors of Money2020) to discuss and work on various strategies moving into 2020. <strong>This is a direct follow-up to another in-person trip the team made earlier in October 2019 to meet up with Spend.com.</strong> Meeting once again, at Money2020, allowed both teams to initiate and walk the first steps of a long-term relationship together. More details will follow this coming Thursday in a blog post published on Particl.news. Definitely stay tuned!</p><p>Special shoutout to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nicholas_Merten\"><strong>Nicholas Merten</strong></a>, aka <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCatR7nWbYrkVXdxXb4cGXw\"><strong>DataDash</strong></a>, which the team had the pleasure to cross paths with at Money2020. His focus, dedication, and projects to help cryptocurrencies move further along the path to mainstream adoption really impressed!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-nQDXMaDJpFACqsgG28IwAw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Nicholas Merten, aka Datadash, hanging out with Particl</figcaption></figure><p>Then, after Money2020, Cryptoguard flew to join the rest of the team in San Francisco while Joe Fisher stayed an additional day in Vegas to take part in the <a href=\"https://worldcryptocon.com/\">WCC conference</a>.</p><p>WCC was the perfect occasion to meet with some of the people the team had been looking forward to meetup with again and yet another quality event to make the first points of contact with various people. Indeed, just like SFBW, WCC attracted a quality crowd as well as many leaders within the blockchain industry, some of which couldn’t make it to SFBW. In that scenario, splitting the team into two different cities really reaped a lot of benefits for Particl.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-oOCQxSc4XZuiiGtoCW04Iw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Joe Fisher and Masha Prusakova at WCC 2019</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"epicenter-sfbw-s-main-event\">Epicenter — SFBW’s Main Event</h2><p>And then came <a href=\"https://sfblockchainweek.io/\"><strong>Epicenter</strong></a>, the main event of the San Francisco Blockchain Week. The Particl team all met as one the day before and came to the conference as a gold sponsor, had a booth right next to the main entrance, and gave a 30-minute talk on the Industry Stage.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-sh0iU5S6N1qmWjpI_stjWw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl Team Showing Off the Open Marketplace at SFBW’s Epicenter</figcaption></figure><p>Just like throughout the first part of the week, the reactions at the booth were overwhelmingly good and, maybe strangely enough, people still looked surprised that a fully decentralized and no compromise blockchain project is already live and looking so good, even to this day. This is the typical feedback Particl has been receiving ever since it started going to more events this year.</p><p>Epicenter’s crowd was definitely smaller than Consensus, but it was much more focused and in “business mode”. The reason for this is actually important to understand. <strong>The people who still remain in blockchain after a more than two-year-long bear market and keep attending these kinds of events are the true pioneers that will propel the next blockchain wave.</strong> They are the people fighting in the trenches, against all odds, to make sure the blockchain revolution will one day catch up on the mainstream level.</p><p>And in San Francisco, of all places, a place renowned for how many tech innovations it generates every year. The people attending these conferences don’t look at the industry with a narrow-minded view. No, they instead know the long-term potential of these groundbreaking technologies and are the ones that are making it happen.</p><p>This is actually the main reason Particl wanted to attend SFBW. The team knew the potential of this local blockchain community, <strong>thanks in part to attending the SF-based </strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-in-san-francisco-bitcoin2019-571fe31fe396\"><strong>Bitcoin2019</strong></a><strong> conference earlier in the year</strong>, and knew it would be a perfectly receptive and excited crowd.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-y1kyfpZ9pREc31ZUZG5RuA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman at Blockchain Research Institute</figcaption></figure><p>And the team was right! Particl had the opportunity to spend some high-quality time with thought leaders and experts from many different industries and received many advice and resources. For example, the Particl team had the chance to meet with <strong>Don Tapscott, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman at </strong><a href=\"https://www.blockchainresearchinstitute.org/\"><strong>Blockchain Research Institute</strong></a>, and earn 30 minutes of his time just before flying out to Europe.</p><p>Indeed, just like with Don Tapscott, many similar breakout meetings, sit-downs, and evening-long discussions happened with several key people working on pushing blockchain forward. The team met with media, capital firms, lawyers, developers, business developers, the inventor of eGift cards, and even a guy that can solve a Rubics cube blindfolded, but more importantly, made many new friends on the way that are as passionate and dedicated to see cryptocurrencies succeed.</p><p>The team also had a 30-minute speaking slot on the Industry Stage and sent Dr. Kap on stage. Some of the people the team has met throughout the week attended the talk which further helped them understand the project’s vision and intentions. The official presentation video will be published within a few days by the SFBW organizers. In the meantime, you can check out Dr. Kap’s presentation on Particl’s Youtube channel.</p><blockquote>The upload originally is a <a href=\"https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB\"><strong>Periscope</strong></a><a href=\"https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB\"><strong>video</strong></a><strong> </strong>taken by Particl’s Community Manager, Guillaume Benayoun.

They get the potential of blockchain and Particl both. <strong>They want to see the industry succeed and the products powered by blockchain land in the hands of everyday people.</strong></p><p>While the team already knew about the quality of the Particl platform, it is now crystal clear from all the feedback received that the Particl ecosystem and its Open Marketplace is very advanced in terms of tech compared to almost any other end-user-focused blockchain product. The vision, mission, and disruptive potential of such a platform is also a shared feeling within all of the people met during this trip.</p><p><strong>But getting this product into people’s hands is equally important, if not more.</strong> The best product in the world serves no purpose if it is not being used by anyone. This trip provided the team with a lot of resources, connections, and offers that will help Particl jump in with two feet into this new adoption-focused phase the project is headed to.</p><p>The team has been able to discuss, in detail and with valuable outside perspectives, the next steps moving into 2020. What’s coming next in 2020 will be very methodical and carefully planned, and it’s all about getting that adoption going. Thanks to this US West Coast trip, the team is now equipped with the best resources it could have hoped for at the best time imaginable. Let’s do this! ?</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s Next?</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-SB2ytltBLugFKL1rJVhF_Q.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>The development team has been focused on the next few items, <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b\">as identified a while ago</a>, required before aggressive adoption strategies can start getting a worthy conversion rate. Indeed, the Open Marketplace and Particl Desktop still lack a few features the team would like to have before actively trying to drive users to the marketplace.</p><p>In the meantime, <strong>the communications and strategy team is now embarking in a new phase</strong> to start the onboarding of users as soon as the platform is ready for adoption. The team will be taking part in various internal workshops in Berlin in the coming weeks along with key connections and advisors made throughout the past two weeks. That’s to craft strategies related to the user adoption of the Open Marketplace and the Particl network in general and help the project pivot towards a a more “business” focused phase in the most efficient manner possible.</p><p>It is very clear, <strong>the team is coming back from this US West Coast trip extremely motivated and hungry for success</strong>. A lot of doors are opening up, on all fronts, directly to Particl and also to the blockchain industry itself. The world is receptive to the idea of blockchain technology but cautious due to this now-very-long bear market. It is why the next steps of the way need to be very methodological to seize the most of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-Gbg9aHfYJ9bhiThjAvvKwQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl Team After Epicenter’s Closure</figcaption></figure><p>As you might start to understand simply by reading this post, <strong>this trip marks the beginning of brand new objectives, challenges, and goals for the project.</strong> Think of it as the “war room phase”, the moment where strategies are made and carefully, methodically set in motion.</p><h3 id=\"next-locations-of-the-particl-world-tour\">Next Locations of the Particl World Tour</h3><p>With that in mind, the team is going to be attending, in a smaller capacity, two additional events and then conclude it’s already very worthy Particl World Tour.</p><p>Indeed, you’ll be able to find Particl at <a href=\"https://blockshow.com/\"><strong>Blockshow Asia</strong></a>, in Singapore, and <a href=\"https://www.slush.org/events/helsinki/\"><strong>Slush Helsinki</strong></a>, in Finland.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-cWDe1_sIGidEmR1cFeidDw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>At Blockshow Asia, the same boots-on-the-grounds approach as used during SFBW’s side-events and WCC will be applied. It will be all about establishing the first points of contact and reconvening with key people within the Asian market to get as much insight as possible. Don’t forget, as mentioned in a <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-in-singapore-consensus-asia-a3be041d315e\"><strong>previous blog post</strong></a> on Particl.news, <strong>Singapore is a place of interest for Particl because of new tax regulations being proposed which would make any sale paid for with cryptocurrencies a tax-free event.</strong> It is a direct use-case for buying and selling using cryptocurrencies and a great opportunity for Particl to shine brightly. This is, quite simply, crypto having a clear shot at going mainstream in Singapore…</p><p>At Slush Helsinki, a tech startup/founder focused conference, the team will be operating a booth and meeting up with various advisors and mentors specifically going to the event to help out motivated, young entrepreneurs. The team will consist of Juha Kovanen (Marketplace Lead Developer), Gerlof van Ek (Lead Designer, Developer), Dr. Kapil Amarasinghe (UK Particl Ambassador), and Gloria (Particl’s Communications &#x26; Strategy Team).</p><p>Both these events will allow Particl to receive even more feedback, advice, and resources as it jumps right into its next phase. The timing of it all couldn’t be better!</p><hr><h2 id=\"you-too-can-be-a-part-of-it-\">You, Too, Can Be a Part of it!</h2><p>The best connections happen face-to-face, this is simply how things happen in the space. The people you meet, in-person, by going to conferences and their related side-events are not the same crypto people you meet online. These are the active and focused people working day and night on the blockchain revolution. They are the ones that make it all happen!</p><p><strong>For this reason, the Particl team very strongly encourages you to go out there and attend your local blockchain events.</strong> Crypto is not dead, it’s alive and kicking in a way that might surprise you! The bear market is making innovators more motivated and hungry for success, a feeling that is not always shared by the “online crypto community”. Go out there, meet people face-to-face, and be right in the middle of the biggest revolution of our times (with no hyperbole added here ?).</p><p>After all, meeting other crypto fans and innovators to change the world is just one part of why you should attend these events. The other part is…well, it is so much FUN! Dare try it just once and you’ll be hooked!</p><hr><p>Stay tuned for <strong>more news about Spend.com’s relationship with Particl this coming Thursday, the 14th of November</strong>.

Initially mentioned\n[https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190359593550901248] last Friday by\nDr. Kapil Amarasinghe during his 30-minute talk at SFBW’s Epicenter\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZAmMXEvkPc], this new payment option will\nallow users to easily use Bitcoin as a form of payment on the Open Marketplace.\nThis news is directly in line with Particl’s current focus on adoption (in this\nparticular case, focused on the cryptocurrency crowd) and makes the Open\nMarketplace more accessible than ever, especially to people not currently part\nof the Particl community.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBitcoin Payment Integration\nHow the integration of this new feature will look like is as a separate,\nstandalone BTC-PART exchange module within Particl Desktop. The module will\ninteract with the checkout process but will not be directly integrated as part\nof the full buy flow. It will instead be displayed as a separate page within\nParticl Desktop.\n\nThe reason for this is simple — once BTC is transferred for PART, the received\nPART is always, at least initially, received on a public balance. As you\nprobably already know, the Open Marketplace funds stored on anon balances to be\nable to purchase products and services. And because converting funds from a\npublic balance to an anon one takes 12 confirmations, on top of which more\nconfirmations are added as a result of the exchange’s own confirmations\n(incoming Bitcoin confirmations, for example), the integration, as it currently\nstands, cannot be integrated as a core component of the buy flow in a\nuser-friendly and practical way.\n\nExchange Module…as a Separate Page\nWIP, Interface Subject to Change (Testnet Only Shows PART to PART Exchange, BTC\non Mainnet Only)How the integration of this BTC-PART module will look like is a\nsimple and convenient Exchange accessible right from the left sidebar of Particl\nDesktop! If you recall, on Particl Desktop, the Wallet section of the menu\ncurrently has these four pages: Send/Convert, Receive, History, and Address\nBook. This update will introduce fifth section, Exchange, to the Wallet section\nof the sidebar. This page will also be accessible from any regular wallet,\nmeaning the exchange feature won’t need to be manually activated by the user.\n\nPutting the Exchange page as a standalone page on any type of wallet means\nBitcoin users will be able to fund their wallets with PART using Bitcoin,\nallowing them to use any of the Particl Desktop features that requires a fee to\nbe paid (privacy transaction, community proposals, flagging items, etc).\n\nExchange Module…as Part of the Checkout Process\nWhile the exchange module will be a standalone application, at least for the\nforeseeable future, it will still be integrated into the checkout process and\ninteract with it. The process is simple — simply go through the same process of\npurchasing an item to your cart as you always do. Add an item to your cart,\nconfirm the cart’s content, enter your shipping information, and then land on\nthe order confirmation page. Right at that moment, you will be met with two\nbuttons — one to confirm your order, and the other to be redirected to the\nexchange module. If you do not have enough funds to place your order, then the\n“Confirm Order” button will be greyed out while the Exchange button will\nredirect you to the exchange module.\n\nOnce there, the module will automatically fill up the number of PART necessary\nto pay for your order and tell you exactly how many BTC are required to acquire\nthat many PART coins. You will then be able to send Bitcoin to the exchange\nmodule and receive PART in exchange. Once the exchange is completed, you’ll be\nable to easily come back to the confirmation section of the checkout process and\nsuccessfully place your order.\n\nSo while Bitcoin won’t directly be a “payment option” per se, the exchange\nmodule will still interact with your cart in a way that makes it easier and\nuser-friendly for everyone to get the right amount of PART using BTC.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThis BTC-PART exchange module will not be using atomic swaps of any sort of\ndecentralized exchange method, at least not for its initial integration.\nInstead, it will be plugged into a non-custodial exchange that doesn’t require\nKYC or personal information —SimpleSwap [https://simpleswap.io/].\n\nWIP, Interface Subject to Change (Testnet Only Shows PART to PART Exchange, BTC\non Mainnet Only)The module uses SMSG to relay messages between Particl and the\nSimpleSwap engine. The key part to understand is that this exchange module has\nbeen built using SMSG in a very generic matter, and it could eventually be used\nas the base layers to deploy all sorts of services on Particl (i.e. price\npegging, chat module, etc). This module is likely to be included in the incoming\nParticl SDK which is probably going to see the day somewhere in 2020.\n\nA “per transaction” limit function has also been integrated into the module as\nwell, making sure users exchange a number of coins that’s in between the minimum\nand maximum range allowed by the exchange. Most of the information that is\nusually displayed when making a transaction on [https://simpleswap.io/]\nSimpleSwap [https://simpleswap.io/] will also all be displayed right from\nParticl Desktop.\n\nAdditionally, the exchange module will also include an “auto-anonymizer” feature\nwhich will allow you to automatically receive your PART on anon balances. This\nadditional privacy feature included in Particl Desktop’s exchange module isn’t\navailable when simply going on [https://simpleswap.io/]SimpleSwap\n[https://simpleswap.io/]’s website. That RingCT exchange perk feature may, or\nmay not, be part of the first iteration of the exchange module, but it is\nalready in development and should follow very shortly after the first release if\nnot immediately ready. Fingers crossed!\n\nFinally, the exchange module is not designed or hardcoded to work only using \n[https://simpleswap.io/]SimpleSwap [https://simpleswap.io/]. That particualr\nexchange was chosen as the initial service provider because of the lack of KYC\nrequirements and the relatively low friction involved in trades. Should new\nexchanges that provide similar benefits list PART, they could be added to the\nmodule, giving users even more options.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll About Adoption and Speed\nThis integration of a BTC-PART payment module is directly in line with the\nteam’s current focus on eliminating the barriers to entry and kickstarting the\nadoption of the Particl network. It significantly increases the potential amount\nof users that can use the Particl ecosystem and makes getting PART as easy as it\nhas ever been.\n\nWIP, Interface Subject to Change (Testnet Only Shows PART to PART Exchange, BTC\non Mainnet Only)While the feature itself is not entirely ready as of the time of\nthis writing, the team has completed the back-end code as well as the testing\nand is currently finalizing the GUI integration. That should be completed within\na few days, and then more testing will be required to make sure its integration\ninto Particl Desktop hasn’t highlighted any new issue. While a definitive\nrelease date cannot be committed to at this moment, we are getting pretty close\nfor the feature to be fully ready. The exchange module will be released as part\nof Particl Desktop 2.3.0.\n\nNote: Particl Desktop 2.2.0 is currently being tested on testnet and should be\nreleased within just a few days. Aside from the new Global Settings feature, it\nwill mostly include bug fixes, flow optimizations, and UI/UX improvements.\nParticl Desktop 2.2.0 and Particl Desktop 2.3.0 are estimated to be released in\nvery close proximity.\n\nThe Pieces are Falling Into Place\nThe Particl team is full steam ahead and working tirelessly on kickstarting the\nadoption of the Particl platform. Stay alert as you can expect some exciting\nnews to be published soon on Particl.news. Suffice to say, the future of Particl\nis looking brighter every day as the pieces of the puzzle are starting to fall\ninto place at a very interesting pace.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Announces-Bitcoin-Exchange-Integration-Into-Particl-Desktop/1-kqXnceUmmgRlUGrFYGulPw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Announces-Bitcoin-Exchange-Integration-Into-Particl-Desktop/1-SvvDdJMh8rUGGY0sr516iQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>WIP, Interface Subject to Change (Testnet Only Shows PART to PART Exchange, BTC on Mainnet Only)</figcaption></figure><p>Today we’re excited to officially announce more details about Particl’s integration of a Bitcoin exchange module into the Particl Desktop client.

The marketplace, having been released as an early Beta software on\nthe 12th of August 2019, still has a few features, functions, and fine-tuning\nrequired before it can safely and easily be used by the “mainstream” crowds.\nThese missing items are key to kickstart a massive adoption of the Open\nMarketplace, and it is for these reasons that the team has been almost\nexclusively working on completing these.\n\nWithout further ado, here are some of the latest developments related to the\nParticl project.\n\n> Note: Not all current developments are part of this update. The team has been\nworking on some exciting stuff that is yet to be announced. Stay tuned as more\nwill be revealed during the Particl World Tour.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop\nParticl Desktop is the network’s flagship client and the most user-friendly way\nto use the available features and Dapps offered by Particl such as the Open\nMarketplace, for example.\n\nGlobal Wallet Settings\nRead more: Particl Desktop Settings\n[https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b#c8cb]\nThe lowest hanging fruit for improving Particl's user experience is by making\nseveral tweaks to the user interface of…\n[https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b#c8cb]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b#c8cb]\n\nThe upcoming Settings feature of Particl Desktop is pretty much\nself-explanatory — it allows you to manage your settings and preferences right\nfrom Particl Desktop and without having to modify configuration files.\n\nWhat’s not yet common knowledge, though, is that the settings and preferences\nwill be separated into two categories. The first category, Global Settings, are\nclient-wide settings that regulate the entire Particl Desktop client. These\nsettings are effective for all wallets and contain options like enable UPnP,\nconnect clients via proxy, or choose the client’s language (for those who prefer\ntheir client not to display text in English).\n\nThe second type of settings, Wallet Settings, are parameters that are effective\nonly within the specific wallet on which they have been set up. What it means is\nthat when changing preferences within the Wallet Settings page, the changes only\napply to the wallet you’re currently in. Changes will not affect other wallets\nand each one can have its independent parameters. An example of wallet-specific\nsettings would be Notifications Settings, where you can specify what you want to\nbe notified of (payment received, pending orders, staking rewards, new\nproposals, etc).\n\nAs it stands today, all the technical changes that were required for the Global\nSettings are now completed. The team is now busy with tweaking the GUI/front-end\nto display the new changes correctly and to easily allow for the updating of\nthese parameters as well as the addition of new options, in the future.\n\nOpen Marketplace\nThe Open Marketplace is Particl’s first official Dapp. It is a decentralized and\nprivate-by-default marketplace where anyone can buy and sell stuff for crypto at\nnear-zero cost and without leaving a trace.\n\nMarket Management\nRead More: Market Management Tool\n[https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b#7168]\nThe lowest hanging fruit for improving Particl's user experience is by making\nseveral tweaks to the user interface of…\n[https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b#7168]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b#7168]\n\nMarket Management is the Open Marketplace’s tool which allows anyone to create a\nshop or a personal market. This is a key component for the Open Marketplace and\nwill be a cornerstone for its adoption as it will allow more customization and\ntools for sellers (i.e. promoting listings, shops, or markets).\n\nAt this moment, the development team is working on the creation and integration\nof seller profiles. Seller profiles are a major addition coming along with\nMarket Management. They allow users to create “profiles” for each wallet. Each\nprofile has its very own “identity” and the client will offer a lot of options\nto manage profiles (i.e. a profile can be manually selected, per wallet, and can\nalso be associated with multiple markets at once). To better understand the\ndistinction between Markets, Profiles, and Identities, as introduced by the\nMarket Management tool, there’s no better explanation than the image below that\nwas put together by Juha Kovanen [https://github.com/xludx], Lead Open\nMarketplace Developer.\n\nA breakdown of Profiles, Markets, and IdentitiesAdditionally, because the Market\nManagement tool is such a big feature, and because it touches most of the Open\nMarketplace’s components, the team’s going through a significant marketplace\nrefactoring process so that the new changes can seamlessly be integrated.\n\nMystery Feature (Will be Revealed at SFBW)\nThe team has been quietly working on a secret feature which will be a major\ndriver to adoption. This feature will only be revealed on Friday the 1st of\nNovember at 11:30 am at SFBW’s Epicenter during Dr. Kapil Amarasinghe’s talk. Of\ncourse, it will be mentioned at the conferences, even before the speech, so if\nyou’re coming to SFBW or are in Vegas, you might get an exclusive scoop! This\nfeature will be a major driver to adoption for the Particl Open Marketplace and\nhas been a long-awaited addition.\n\nThe back-end code for this feature is now almost complete, with the front-end\nintegration beginning this week, if all goes well. Particl’s development team\nplans on starting the internal testing by the end of the week. While it’s likely\nthat the feature won’t be ready for release during SFBW, it will still be\nannounced regardless, even if that means that it will be released a short time\nafter the conference.\n\nOnce the feature is announced, a blog post will be published on Particl.news\nwith all the details!\n\nParticl Core\nParticl Core is the underlying blockchain protocol on which the Particl\necosystem runs.\n\nParticl’s Lightning Network\nParticl Lightning Network Now Available on Testnet\n[https://particl.news/particl-lightning-network-now-available-on-testnet-eb87a5ab65cd]\n⚡️First Testnet Particl LND Transaction Successful⚡️ Last week, Particl's Core\nDeveloper and Cryptographer, Tecnovert …\n[https://particl.news/particl-lightning-network-now-available-on-testnet-eb87a5ab65cd]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-lightning-network-now-available-on-testnet-eb87a5ab65cd]\n\nTo make sure the Particl network can handle as many transactions as possible,\nParticl’s Lead Core Developer and Cryptographer, Tecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert], has re-enabled Bitcoin-style Segwit scripts\ncompatibility with Particl Core and reverted Particl’s Lightning Network to a\nsimpler implementation that’s closer to Bitcoin’s. This will allow for a much\nsimpler implementation of Particl’s Lightning Network on mainnet and also make\nPART easier to integrate to PSBT hardware wallets\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0174.mediawiki].\n\nWhile it’s probably going to be some time until the Lightning Network is\nrequired for Particl to handle more transactions on its network (it’s estimated\nthat the Particl network can do about 70–80 public transactions per second),\nthis is a good pre-emptive measure to ensure that the protocol is ready as soon\nas it needs to be used.\n\nIt’s important to note that the Lightning Network can be used for more than just\nscaling a blockchain network. It can, for example, be used to facilitate and\nimprove the performance of atomic swaps or conduct swaps directly on LND,\nwithout even using atomic swaps. It is expected that LND will be used, in the\nfuture, to facilitate PART swaps.\n\nParticl Core 0.19.0.1 RC1 Pre-Released\nAlways with keeping with the latest Bitcoin Core development in mind, Particl\nCore 0.19.0.1 RC1\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1rc1] has been\npre-released on testnet and mainnet. While this isn’t particularly the biggest\nor most exciting update of Particl Core ever, it is important to keep these\nupdates coming as it makes sure Particl’s version doesn’t drift away from the\n“mother code”.\n\nIn reality, the longer you wait to update a Bitcoin-based codebase to Bitcoin’s\nlatest version, the more complicated and time-consuming it gets to update it\nlater. Additionally, it ensures that the chain benefits from all the same\nusability, performance, and security updates that Bitcoin gets.\n\nIf you feel like helping out, you can download Particl Core 0.19.0.1 RC1\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1rc1] today and\nreport any bug you find on Github, that is, if you find any, of course!

The first category, Global Settings, are client-wide settings that regulate the entire Particl Desktop client. These settings are effective for all wallets and contain options like <strong>enable UPnP, connect clients via proxy, or choose the client’s language </strong>(for those who prefer their client not to display text in English).</p><p>The second type of settings, Wallet Settings, are parameters that are effective only within the specific wallet on which they have been set up. What it means is that when changing preferences within the Wallet Settings page, the changes only apply to the wallet you’re currently in. Changes will not affect other wallets and each one can have its independent parameters. An example of wallet-specific settings would be Notifications Settings, where you can specify what you want to be notified of (payment received, pending orders, staking rewards, new proposals, etc).</p><p>As it stands today, all the technical changes that were required for the Global Settings are now completed. The team is now busy with tweaking the GUI/front-end to display the new changes correctly and to easily allow for the updating of these parameters as well as the addition of new options, in the future.</p><h2 id=\"open-marketplace\">Open Marketplace</h2><p>The Open Marketplace is Particl’s first official Dapp. It is a decentralized and private-by-default marketplace where anyone can buy and sell stuff for crypto at near-zero cost and without leaving a trace.</p><h3 id=\"market-management\">Market Management</h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b#7168\"><strong>Read More: Market Management Tool</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b#7168\"><em>The lowest hanging fruit for improving Particl's user experience is by making several tweaks to the user interface of…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b#7168\">particl.news</a></p><p>Market Management is the Open Marketplace’s tool which allows anyone to create a shop or a personal market. This is a key component for the Open Marketplace and will be a cornerstone for its adoption as it will allow more customization and tools for sellers (i.e. promoting listings, shops, or markets).</p><p>At this moment, the development team is working on the creation and integration of seller profiles. Seller profiles are a major addition coming along with Market Management. They allow users to create “profiles” for each wallet. Each profile has its very own “identity” and the client will offer a lot of options to manage profiles (i.e. a profile can be manually selected, per wallet, and can also be associated with multiple markets at once). To better understand the distinction between Markets, Profiles, and Identities, as introduced by the Market Management tool, there’s no better explanation than the image below that was put together by <a href=\"https://github.com/xludx\"><strong>Juha Kovanen</strong></a>, Lead Open Marketplace Developer.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Development-Update/1-Zja7UddW6i0pX1-flBGZpw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>A breakdown of Profiles, Markets, and Identities</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, because the Market Management tool is such a big feature, and because it touches most of the Open Marketplace’s components, the team’s going through a significant marketplace refactoring process so that the new changes can seamlessly be integrated.</p><h3 id=\"mystery-feature-will-be-revealed-at-sfbw-\">Mystery Feature (Will be Revealed at SFBW)</h3><p>The team has been quietly working on a secret feature which will be a major driver to adoption. This feature will only be revealed on Friday the 1st of November at 11:30 am at SFBW’s Epicenter during Dr. Kapil Amarasinghe’s talk. Of course, it will be mentioned at the conferences, even before the speech, so if you’re coming to SFBW or are in Vegas, you might get an exclusive scoop! This feature will be a major driver to adoption for the Particl Open Marketplace and has been a long-awaited addition.</p><p>The back-end code for this feature is now almost complete, with the front-end integration beginning this week, if all goes well. Particl’s development team plans on starting the internal testing by the end of the week. While it’s likely that the feature won’t be ready for release during SFBW, it will still be announced regardless, even if that means that it will be released a short time after the conference.</p><p>Once the feature is announced, a blog post will be published on Particl.news with all the details!</p><h2 id=\"particl-core\">Particl Core</h2><p>Particl Core is the underlying blockchain protocol on which the Particl ecosystem runs.</p><h3 id=\"particl-s-lightning-network\">Particl’s Lightning Network</h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-lightning-network-now-available-on-testnet-eb87a5ab65cd\"><strong>Particl Lightning Network Now Available on Testnet</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-lightning-network-now-available-on-testnet-eb87a5ab65cd\"><em>⚡️First Testnet Particl LND Transaction Successful⚡️ Last week, Particl's Core Developer and Cryptographer, Tecnovert …</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-lightning-network-now-available-on-testnet-eb87a5ab65cd\">particl.news</a></p><p>To make sure the Particl network can handle as many transactions as possible, Particl’s Lead Core Developer and Cryptographer, <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert\"><strong>Tecnovert</strong></a>, has re-enabled Bitcoin-style Segwit scripts compatibility with Particl Core and reverted Particl’s Lightning Network to a simpler implementation that’s closer to Bitcoin’s. This will allow for a much simpler implementation of Particl’s Lightning Network on mainnet and also make PART easier to integrate to <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0174.mediawiki\"><strong>PSBT hardware wallets</strong></a>.</p><p>While it’s probably going to be some time until the Lightning Network is required for Particl to handle more transactions on its network (it’s estimated that the Particl network can do about 70–80 public transactions per second), this is a good pre-emptive measure to ensure that the protocol is ready as soon as it needs to be used.</p><p>It’s important to note that the Lightning Network can be used for more than just scaling a blockchain network. It can, for example, be used to facilitate and improve the performance of atomic swaps or conduct swaps directly on LND, without even using atomic swaps.

When a seller replies to a question, it is marked with a special\ndesignation so that it is obvious that it is the seller’s answer to the\nquestion. The feature isn’t unlike Amazon’s very popular Q&A section on each\nlisted item’s page. This first version of the Q&A implementation does not\ncurrently include a notification system, but it will be part of a further\nupdate. A notification system for questions is already being worked on.\n\nQuestions & AnswersProduct Imports: This feature allows you to import products and inventories from\noutside sources. Its first version will allow the importation of products from\nWooCommerce stores as well as from .csv (spreadsheet) files. This tool is\ndesigned to make it easier for sellers who are already selling online and those\nwith large inventories to import and list their products more quickly. As all\nlistings used to need to be added manually, one by one, this feature is going to\nsave sellers a ton of time.\n\nProduct Imports\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started\nDownload Particl Desktop 2.0.2: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.1.0\n\nparticl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.1.0]\nYou can't perform that action at this time.

This script is intended to be executed on staking nodes as a companion\nto the Partyman [https://github.com/dasource/partyman] cold staking application,\nbut can also be executed without Partyman [https://github.com/dasource/partyman] \nbeing installed on the node. In that case, Partyman\n[https://github.com/dasource/partyman] will automatically be installed to the\nlatest version by the Private Cold Staking script.\n\n> Note: Partyman [https://github.com/dasource/partyman] is the application\nrequired to create and run a cold staking node on the Particl network. Follow \nthis tutorial\n[https://particl.news/guide-setting-up-particl-cold-staking-f5d9073bac4] to\nlearn how to install and use it so that you can safely cold stake your funds.\nPrivate Cold Staking V1.0Download: https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking\n\nGBen1/Private-Coldstaking [https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking]\nThis script allows you to anonymize automatically your coldstaking rewards on\nyour node and to redirect them… [https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking]\ngithub.com [https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking]\n\nTo install directly on your staking node, type the following commands:\n\ncd ~ && git clone https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking.git\n\ncd Private-Coldstaking && bash privatecoldstaking.sh\n\nPPoS — A Security-Focused Proof-of-Stake Protocol\nParticl Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) is Particl’s very own and super secure\nProof-of-Stake algorithm. In fact, it is one of the most secure PoS algorithms\nin the blockchain space due to its cold staking capabilities.\n\nFor those not familiar with it, cold staking allows you to delegate the staking\nweight of your funds to a node which contains no coin, meaning that the wallet\nthat actually holds the coins can be taken offline and still contribute to\nsecuring the Particl network (and receive staking rewards for it). What makes\nthe cold staking capabilities of PPoS even more secure is the fact that it can\nbe used in combination with a hardware wallet like a Ledger Nano S device, for\nexample, bringing its level of security to an absurdly high level.\n\nOne thing Particl Proof-of-Stake does not do, however, is private/stealth\nstaking. In other words, you can only stake funds held in public balances, but\nnot in blind or anon balances. But considering the great privacy protocols\navailable on the Particl network (Confidential Transactions (CT) and RingCT),\nthere really shouldn’t be any reason why staking privately shouldn’t be\npossible.\n\nWhy isn’t PPoS Private by Default in the First Place?\nAs the previous section of this blog post mentions, PPoS is a security-focused\nProof-of-Stake protocol, meaning security comes first before anything else.\nAfter all, PoS protocols are what’s responsible for the verification of\ntransactions and the creation of coins on the network. If something goes wrong\nhere, it can spell a lot of troubles for the chain.\n\nThe main issue with a fully private Proof-of-Stake protocol is auditability. In\nfact, while it could be proven without a doubt that the inflation model is fine\n(you can prove the right amount of coins is being created at the right time, and\nyou can detect if an exploit if being used to create a fraudulent amount of\ncoins at the inflation level), it’s not possible, however, to detect some edge\ncases where an attacker would be able to create coins out of thin air without\nissuing them through the usual inflation process.\n\nNote that Proof-of-Work coins with a “private by default” approach to mining,\nsuch as Monero, are also vulnerable to this issue. This isn’t a vulnerability\nthat is exclusive to Proof-of-Stake. At this point, there has been a few\ninstances of inflation-related attacks, notably in regards to the Zerocoin\nprotocol\n[https://cryptoslate.com/zerocoin-exploit-found-zcoin-attacked-other-privacy-coins-at-risk/] \n(Zerocoin, PIVX, Veil, etc) which had to be disabled on the affected coins.\nThere has been a similar bug on Monero and some of its forks\n[https://www.getmonero.org/2017/05/17/disclosure-of-a-major-bug-in-cryptonote-based-currencies.html] \nwhich would have allowed an attacker to create an unlimited amount of coins\nwithout ever being able to detect it. Luckily, this has never been exploited and\nthe bug has been fixed a long time before. Imagine thousands upon thousands of\ncoins being generated out of thin air without anyone being able to detect it…\n\nMaking Cold Staking Private Without the Security Concessions\n)But, again, considering the great privacy protocols available on the Particl\nnetwork (Confidential Transactions (CT) and RingCT), there really shouldn’t be\nany reason why staking privately shouldn’t be possible. And this is where the\nPrivate Cold Staking script comes into action.\n\nThe Private Cold Staking script is a script coded by Particl’s Community\nManager, Guillaume Benayoun. It allows you to automatically anonymize your\nstaking rewards using RingCT. This means you can now safely cold stake your\ncoins and remain anonymous on the network.\n\nBecause the script doesn’t operate at the protocol level, it can provide a very\npowerful level of privacy without compromising on the security side of things.\nTo be clear, with this script, Particl Proof-of-Stake remains untouched. The\nprivacy aspect of things is granted by the Private Cold Staking script itself.\n\nWhat it Can and Can’t Do\nThe Private Cold Staking script is intended to be used as a companion tool to\nthe Partyman cold staking app. It has to be used directly on your cold staking\nnode and uses entropy to obfuscate patterns\n[https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking/blob/master/README.md], thus\nincreasing the level of privacy. This script allows you to do three things:\n\n * Automatically anonymize your staking rewards and send them to a public\n   address of your choice\n * Automatically anonymize your staking rewards and send them to a blind (CT)\n   address of your choice\n * Automatically anonymize your staking rewards and send them to an anon (RingCT\n   ) address of your choice\n\nThe Private Cold Staking cannot, however, stake funds held on stealth addresses\n(blind or anon balances).\n\n> Note: Due to the nature of the script, a few coins will be held on your cold\nstaking node for a small amount of time (under 24 hours). It is not recommended\nto use this script if your staking environment isn’t safe (i.e. shared computer,\nuntrustworthy VPS, etc).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to Use the Private Cold Staking Script\n * Download the script on your cold staking node\n   cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking.git\n * Navigate to the script’s directory\n   cd Private-Coldstaking/\n * Execute the script and go through the setup process\n   bash privatecoldstaking.sh\n * Make sure everything is set up properly\n   bash update.sh\n * If you wish to uninstall the script, run the uninstaller\n   bash uninstall.sh\n\nFor more information, refer directly to the script’s README file\n[https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking/blob/master/README.md] on Github.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Private Cold Staking script takes Particl Proof-of-Stake to the next level\nby enabling solid privacy options without sacrificing any of its security. It is\ndirectly in line with Particl’s commitment to both security and privacy. Since\nit will create more anon outputs that can then be used by the network to better\nanonymize other RingCT transactions, it directly contributes to improving the\noverall privacy of the network.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Time to protect your finances and reclaim your\nprivacy! ?","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Private-Cold-Staking-Script-Released/1-zeOzkM2eQLG3Nsd6TbzY_w.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"anonymizing-your-staking-rewards-with-ringct-\">Anonymizing Your Staking Rewards With RingCT ?</h3><p>Particl is proud to announce the release of a private cold staking script on Github.

Quite to\nthe contrary, it is the beginning of a great journey in disrupting one of the\nbiggest economic sector of the world— the eCommerce sector.\n\nIt’s been mentioned in the past that, as the Open Marketplace goes live on\nmainnet, it would signify a gradual change of phase for the project. Whereas\nParticl used to be almost exclusively focused on development, getting a live\nproduct means user adoption will now play a more important role. After all, this\nproject has always been about building a product that people could use to\naddress real-world issues. It has always been about creating a solution that\nempowers individuals and enables businesses to reach their full potential. And\nnow that the solution is here, it’s time to get people to use it and benefit\nfrom its groundbreaking technology.\n\nNow it’s Adoption Time!\nEver since the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace, the Particl team has\nreceived a huge amount of feedback and comments about the overall user\nexperience. And it is this user experience, the feeling you get when using the\nmarketplace, that is critical in getting new people and businesses to use\nParticl. It is one of the key factors in determining the “user conversion rate”,\nor the number of people that become recurring users after trying out the\nmarketplace for the first time.\n\nIndeed, getting new people to try out the marketplace is one thing, but\nretaining them as users is a whole other story. Most of the time, people are\nmore than willing to sacrifice their data and even pay higher prices if the user\nexperience is better elsewhere. And besides, you also get one chance at first\nimpressions.\n\nFor this reason, the new Open Marketplace development roadmap will now be\nheavily focused on building what needs to be done to make the user experience as\ngood and as accessible as possible. In other words, each new marketplace feature\nreleased within the next few weeks and months will directly contribute in making\nthe user experience better, thus increasing the user conversion rate and\nallowing more sellers and buyers to be onboarded.\n\nWhat are the Current Barriers to Entry\nSince the ultimate goal of the Open Marketplace is to empower individuals and\nbusinesses on a global scale, it’s important to identify what are the current\nbarriers to entry for anyone to start using the marketplace. After that, it’s\ncrucial to identify what can be done about it and then act on it.\n\nBy definition, a barrier to entry is an obstacle or hindrance that makes it hard\nto adopt a new product. This obstacle can be a technological challenge,\ndifficult government regulations, a steep financial cost, a lack of education\nabout a topic, and etc. In the Open Marketplace’s case, the barriers to entry\nare mostly technological, financial, and educational.\n\nThat much is made quite obvious when you start to go over the list of the most\nreported issues, comments, and feedback regarding the user experience of the\nmarketplace since it’s been released on mainnet. When all summarized, most of it\ncan be boiled down to a few main barriers to entry that makes it a bit\nchallenging for buyers and sellers to adopt the platform. Some of the most\nreported user experience issues include:\n\n * The setup process of the marketplace (it has to be manually enabled) could be\n   improved (technological barrier)\n * Listing fees being too high for large-scale sellers (financial barrier)\n * The double deposit MAD escrow requires a security deposit from both sides \n   (financial barrier)\n * There is no branding or identification option for vendors (technological\n   barrier)\n * The marketplace currently only accepts the PART coin and not Bitcoin, other\n   cryptocurrencies, or more traditional means of payment (technological\n   barrier)\n * The entire blockchain and SMSG network needs to be synced, which takes a few\n   minutes to do (technological barrier)\n * What needs to be done to complete a certain action isn’t always perfectly\n   clear (educational barrier)\n * How funds move throughout a full transaction process (educational barrier)\n\nThese barriers to entry are the main obstacles that make it harder for Particl\nto be adopted to a wider level. As such, solutions to these issues will be\nprioritized moving forward, and each item contained within the Open Marketplace\ndevelopment roadmap for the next few months is designed to increase the adoption\nof the Open Marketplace by improving the user experience.\n\nMake Particl as Accessible as Any Other Marketplace\nTo eliminate the barriers that make the Open Marketplace hard to adopt for most\npeople, the Particl team has planned and started working on several improvements\nand features. Each of them is designed to feed off each other and directly\ncontribute to improving Particl’s user experience for both buyers and sellers.\n\nWhat follows is an estimated release timeline of the next few features that are\ngoing to make their way onto Particl’s Open Marketplace. There’s currently no\ndate or time estimate associated with any of these features, but they’re what’s\nbeing worked on at this moment and what is planned to be released in the short\nto mid-term.\n\n> Note: This development timeline is only an estimation of the order at which\nfeatures will be released live on mainnet. All listed items are subject to\nchange.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Coming Up for Particl?\n * User Interface Tweaks\n * Lowering Marketplace Fees\n * Product Import Tool (1)\n * Q&A Section — Ask a Question to a Seller (2)\n * Particl Desktop Settings Page (3)\n * Market Management Tool (4)\n * Adjustable Escrow Ratio (5)\n * Inventory and Quantity Management Tool (6)\n * Then What?\n   Alternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments\n   Mobile Application\n   Developer SDK Tools\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUser Interface Tweaks\nImproved Sell Orders Page (Work-in-Progress)The lowest hanging fruit for\nimpoving Particl’s user experience is by making several tweaks to the user\ninterface of Particl Desktop, the client on which the Open Marketplace is\nhosted. These tweaks are currently being worked on based on user feedback and\nwill make using Particl much easier, especially for those who haven’t used it in\nthe past. These improvements and additions will also display more information to\nbuyers and sellers, making it easier to track what’s happening within the client\n(i.e. why funds are moving around, or at what time has a certain transaction\nbeen locked into escrow, and etc).\n\nLowering Marketplace Fees\nOne of the most reported issue with the Open Marketplace is the cost of listing\nan item. As the marketplace is fully autonomous and isn’t being operated by any\nthird-party, it charges no commission, subscription, payment processing, or\nescrow fee at all. It does, however, charge a small listing fee to fight off\nspam on the network.\n\nIn fact, when listing an item, the network usually charges sellers with a few\ncents worth of PART every day. And while it isn’t that big of a deal for any\nseller making a few sales here and there on their listings, especially given the\nfact that no commission is being charged on top of sales, it can quickly add up\nfor some of the smaller scale vendors who struggle to make sales and sellers\nwith huge inventories (hundreds/thousands of listings).\n\nAdjusting Marketplace Listing Fees on the Partyman AppFortunately, you can\nactually contribute to making this listing fee smaller. The Particl team has\npublished on their blog a full tutorial\n[https://particl.news/adjusting-listing-fees-4b676e230601] on how to instruct\nyour staking node to broadcast a request for lower fees to the SMSG network.\nSMSG is the network on which marketplace-related content is published and\nhosted.\n\nAdditionally, the Particl team is in the process of improving and optimizing the\nSMSG network. It is estimated that the marketplace fees (i.e. listing fees) will\nsignificantly be lowered due to the more effective SMSG codebase.\n\nThese changes will come gradually within the Beta phase of development of the\nmarketplace as updates get pushed.\n\nProduct Import Tool\nProduct Import Tool (Work-in-Progress)One of the key components of a two-sided\nmarketplace is getting a good amount of sellers and listed products. This is why\nthe new Particl Open Marketplace roadmap for the next few months includes a lot\nof tools that will make it easier for sellers to adopt the platform.\n\nOne such tool is the Product Import tool. This tool allows vendors to quickly\nimport large inventories from other sources, considerably reducing the time it\ntakes to populate the marketplace when holding custody of large inventories.\nWithout this feature, sellers need to manually add listings one by one, which is\na very time-consuming process.\n\nWith this feature in place, sellers are going to be able to import and list\nlarge inventories with only a few clicks. Outside sources for inventory\nimportation will include WooCommerce stores and CSV files (spreadsheets). More\noptions are very likely to be added in the future.\n\nQ&A Section — Ask a Question to a Seller\nBut a two-sided marketplace being a two-sided marketplace, it also needs a good\namount of buyers so that it can reach its full potential. This is where the\nupcoming Q&A section comes into play.\n\nThis “comment section” will allow anyone to ask questions to vendors before\npurchasing (or flagging) a product. This isn’t unlike the very popular Q&A\nsection that Amazon has had for some time now, and it goes a great way into\ngiving you information that might be missing from the item’s description.\n\nThis feature, while not a direct line of contact with the seller, will help\nbuyers make more informed purchasing decisions and give a little bit more\nconfidence when buying an item from a complete stranger. The more you know, the\nbetter decisions one can make.\n\nParticl Desktop Settings Page\nThe Particl Desktop Settings page is a no-brainer. Currently, if you want to\nchange a configuration on your Particl Desktop client, you either have to modify\nsome config file or enter some command inside the console. This works, but since\nthe goal is to make Particl’s user experience as good as possible, it’s\ndefinitely not as user-friendly as it should be.\n\nThe Settings page is pretty much what you would expect from a…settings page. It\nallows you to change various preferences without having to go through the hassle\nof finding a tutorial on how to find and modify a config file, or find a list of\ncommands to enter in the console.\n\nMarket Management Tool\nThe Market Management tool is one of the most awaited features of the Open\nMarketplace, and rightly so. It is what’s going to make all the individual\npieces of the marketplace click together and form into a giant distributed\nnetwork of markets.\n\nSelect What Market (or Storefront) to Browse (Work-in-Progress)Market Management\nwill allow you to either create a market of your own or connect your client to a\npre-existing one. These community markets can be created by anyone and are\ncompletely independent of the main interface of the Open Marketplace. In fact,\nthey are powered by completely different sets of market keys, meaning no data\ncan be shared between the different markets. It’s like multi-wallets, but more\nadvanced and for markets.\n\nOn Particl, there are two types of markets: community markets, and storefronts.\n\nCommunity Markets: They are markets on which anyone that has access to it can\nbuy or sell goods and services. They function exactly the same as the main\ninterface of the Open Marketplace, and nobody has any special permission over\nother users. Not even the market creator. These markets, however, are not\nenabled nor visible by default. To access these markets, you need to connect\nyour Particl Desktop client to its Market ID.\n\n> Note: The main interface of the Open Marketplace is a community market that’s\nenabled and displayed by default by the Particl Desktop client.\nJoined Markets (and Storefronts) Page (Work-in-Progress)Storefronts: They are customizable community markets on which special\npermissions can be attributed to various users. In their most common sense, they\nare storefronts on which a seller can “set up a shop” in such a way that only\nhim (or the people he gives administrator rights to) can publish listings.\nAnyone with access to a storefront can only buy (or flag) the listings put on\nthere by the owner of the storefront. Storefronts can also be used by\ncommunities looking for higher standards in quality on which only vetted sellers\ncould publish listings.\n\n> Note: By default, Particl Desktop has no way to automatically find Market IDs on\nthe network. These keys need to be distributed manually by whoever wants people\nto interact with a certain market or storefront…unless these markets/storefronts\nget promoted.\nPromote a Market or Storefront (Work-in-Progress)While Particl Desktop cannot\nautomatically scan and detect community markets, it is still possible to promote\nyour market to the network, for a fee. When “promoting” your market (or\nstorefront), your Particl Desktop client broadcasts the Market ID of your market\nto the network using SMSG. It is then picked up by the other clients connected\nto the Particl network, and is added to a “market browser”. At this point, a\nmarket will act just like a listing. It will show up on the market browser for\nthe amount of time it’s been promoted. Once the promotion period ends, the\nmarket disappears from the market browser.\n\n> Note: Once a market or storefront disappears from the market browser, it is\nstill accessible to anyone with its Market ID. The only difference is that it\nwon’t be publicly accessible from the market browser itself.\nAnyone with the proper Market IDs of a market or storefront can promote it. All\nthe fees paid to bump/promote community markets are, just like the listing fees,\nredistributed to stakers.\n\nCreate a New Storefront With Logo (Work-in-Progress)Storefronts are ideal for\nsellers with an already established reputation. It allows them to guarantee to\ntheir customer base that a given market, thus all products published inside of\nit, belongs to him. This can easily be done by, for example, displaying the\nMarket ID of the storefront on the seller’s official website.\n\nAdditionally, storefronts allow for a minimal amount of customization/branding\n(logo, store description, store title) and aggregate all the listings of a\nvendor to a single point of access This makes it easier and quicker for\ncustomers to find what they’re looking for, when they need it.\n\nAdjustable Escrow Ratio\nAs it stands right now, Particl’s double deposit MAD escrow system only works\nusing a 100% ratio, meaning both parties need to deposit a security deposit\nequal to 100% of the value of the item or service being purchased. There’s\nnothing wrong with that, of course. After all, a 100% ratio does provide the\nbest game-theory for this type of escrow. There might, however, be some\ncircumstances where such an escrow system wouldn’t be ideal.\n\nTake the example of a well-known seller that’s already trusted by its customer\nbase and runs a storefront on Particl. This seller might want to move some of\nits inventory on Particl to save on fees and improve the level of privacy for\nhis business as well as his customers. But since that seller is already\nwell-known and has an established customer base, it might not be ideal for both\nthe seller and its customer to front funds in order to cover a double deposit\nMAD escrow smart-contract. There is already trust that’s been established\nbetween the two parties and, since the seller is running a Particl storefront,\nhe can prove ownership of the products being offered simply by spreading his\nMarket ID on his website or social media pages. In that situation, the required\nsecurity deposits become an unnecessary obstacle for both the seller and the\nbuyer as they do not necessarily require, or want, escrow protection for\ntransactions.\n\nWhat an adjustable escrow would mean is that vendors could set up their own\nescrow ratio preferences from 0% to 100%. In the above example of a well-known\nseller running a Particl storefront, he could just reduce his escrow ratio to\n0%, meaning no security deposit would be required from neither the buyer or the\nvendor. This, of course, means that buyers would have no recourse against a\ndishonest seller, but for those already-established sellers with an existing\ncustomer base, having the opportunity to not have to advance coins to fund the\nescrow system would make adopting Particl’s Open Marketplace much more of a\nno-brainer.\n\nInventory and Quantity Management Tool\nThis feature is self-explanatory. There is no way, currently, to manage a wide\ninventory and add quantities to your listing. Fortunately, the marketplace\nback-end currently allows for most of it, but it hasn’t been integrated into the\nOpen Marketplace just yet. Note that a relatively fair amount of development is\nstill needed around this feature and it is likely to be released after the\nMarket Management tool.\n\nThis tool, like its name implies, allows vendors to easily manage inventory\nquantities, manage multiple listings, and etc. Just like the Product Import\ntool, Inventory Management is going to make it way easier for sellers with large\ninventories to take the leap and get started selling on Particl without it being\na big hassle.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThen What?\nAll of the above-mentioned items are placed into a short to mid-term roadmap,\nmeaning they are likely to be released within the next few weeks and months,\ndepending on the feature. But wait, there’s more to it!\n\nThe Particl team is thinking ahead and has already planned and started doing\nresearch on the features that are going to be worked on once the above\nmarketplace development roadmap is completed.\n\nAlternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments\nOne of the barriers to entry for Particl’s Open Marketplace currently is that it\nonly works with PART, Particl’s native privacy coin. This, of course, is due to\nthe nature of the technology and how the marketplace has to use PART for its\nprivacy and smart-contract capabilities\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd]. If it\nwere using Bitcoin, not only would transactions take a considerably longer time\ndue to longer confirmations, but the marketplace wouldn’t be able to offer a\nprivate-by-default experience to its users. And if it were using Monero, it\nwould be okay on the privacy side of things, but then the coin couldn’t be used\nwithin smart-contracts. The PART coin is a next-generation privacy coin that\nhas\nboth a solid privacy scheme and a flexible codebase\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd] which\nallows it to be used within smart-contracts. As far as privacy coins come, it’s\npretty much getting your cake and eating it too! The good stuff…without the\nlimitations.\n\nBut in the end, people want an easy-to-use marketplace with good user\nexperience, and only accepting PART severely limits the number of new users that\ncan be onboarded (that’s because everybody uses Bitcoin, mostly). To address\nthis issue, the Particl team is going to be working on integrating alternative\nmethods of payments, like paying with Bitcoin, for example.\n\nThere are a couple of ways this can be done, either through an atomic swap\nwidget or by integrating a third-party partner. And while the Particl team would\nlike to use an atomic swap solution (research and development on the matter is\nongoing at this very moment), a third-party integration might have to be coded\nin until an atomic swap application is fully ready (and thoroughly tested) to\ngo. There are currently investigations going into this question specifically,\nand so more details will be able to be communicated in the future.\n\nIt’s important to note though that, regardless of the method chosen to accept\ndifferent payment methods, the PART coin will always be the coin that settles\nthe transaction in the end. That’s because even though Particl’s Open\nMarketplace would be accepting Bitcoin, the marketplace Dapp still needs PART to\noperate as it is the coin that gives it its privacy and smart-contract\ncapabilities. This means any non-PART payments will be automatically converted\ninto a PART transaction, in the background, on behalf of the user. The end\nresult is that the buyer pays with Bitcoin, and the Open Marketplace does all\nthe rest, transferring the Bitcoin into Particl to fuel the escrow contract.\n\nMobile Application\nAnother very important upcoming feature is a Particl Open Marketplace mobile\napplication. Indeed, most people now shop on their cellphones, which means\ndownloading a software that requires you to sync two networks (blockchain +\nSMSG) is definitely a downgrade in terms of user experience. Sure, it provides\nway better privacy and decentralization, but for most people, this is too weak\nof an argument against a lazy and fast user-experience.\n\nAnd so, to address this issue, the Particl team has scheduled the development of\na mobile application. Research is already being put into this item at this very\nmoment, although it is not a top priority for the team right now. That’s because\nthere are still some core features missing to the marketplace (the items in the\nabove roadmap) that need to be added before the team can think of wrapping\neverything within a mobile application. Once the above roadmap is complete or\nnear-complete, that’s when the Open Marketplace’s mobile application is going to\nbecome more of a focus.\n\nThis mobile application will make Particl as accessible as it will have ever\nbeen. In fact, most of the world uses cellphones and more and more people now\nspend more time on their phone than on their computer. To make sure the\napplication has good performance and setup speed, it is more than likely to be a\n“light wallet”, meaning it won’t require you to download the entire blockchain\nand SMSG network to function. In other words, this application is intended to be\nas easy to use as any traditional marketplace mobile application (i.e. Amazon’s\napplication).\n\nDeveloper SDK Tools\nWith bringing more people within the Particl ecosystem in mind, the team has\nplanned for the release of an SDK tool. This tool will be accompanied by various\ntechnical documentation that is now currently missing. This will allow outside\ndevelopers and teams to easily start contributing to the Particl network by\ndeveloping services, decentralized applications, marketplace features, and etc.\n\nBecause the Open Marketplace is still very much into a heavy development phase,\nthis SDK tool is likely to be one of the last items of this article to see the\nday. With this in mind, the SDK tool will be going live once the Particl code\ngets “stable enough” so that it makes sense to commit to a version and write\ndocumentation on it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet’s Wrap it Up\nAll of the above-mentioned features that are going to be added to Particl have\none thing in common — they are part of a bigger puzzle that’s gonna make the\nOpen Marketplace much more accessible and easy to use for everyone. They all\ncontribute to eliminate the current barriers to entry that makes adopting\nParticl more complicated for most people.\n\nOnce in place, these should take Particl to the next level, making it a much\nmore credible contender for mainstream adoption. In the meantime, Particl\npioneers such as you can still buy and sell anything for crypto, without leaving\na trace, using the current version of the Open Marketplace. And since the\nmarketplace is now live on mainnet, new features and improvements can be\nexpected to come out at an accelerated pace!\n\nParticl is now well on its way on the path towards mainstream adoption. The\ndevelopment team is now a well-oiled machine and is excited to enter this new\nphase for the Particl project. The base layer is there, now it’s all about\nputting the last pieces to the puzzle together. This is where it gets exciting\nand when it starts moving faster!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-r41YvsRXOJyeVDkN_GcTqg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"new-marketplace-development-update-roadmap\">New Marketplace Development Update &amp; Roadmap</h3><p>It has now been more than 2 weeks since the Particl Open Marketplace has launched on mainnet.

As the marketplace is fully autonomous and isn’t being operated by any third-party, it charges no commission, subscription, payment processing, or escrow fee at all. It does, however, charge a small listing fee to fight off spam on the network.</p><p>In fact, when listing an item, the network usually charges sellers with a few cents worth of PART every day. And while it isn’t that big of a deal for any seller making a few sales here and there on their listings, especially given the fact that no commission is being charged on top of sales, it can quickly add up for some of the smaller scale vendors who struggle to make sales and sellers with huge inventories (hundreds/thousands of listings).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-OLpQIvxuczEzoa_flsWpfw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Adjusting Marketplace Listing Fees on the Partyman App</figcaption></figure><p>Fortunately, you can actually contribute to making this listing fee smaller. <a href=\"https://particl.news/adjusting-listing-fees-4b676e230601\"><strong>The Particl team has published on their blog a full tutorial</strong></a> on how to instruct your staking node to broadcast a request for lower fees to the SMSG network. SMSG is the network on which marketplace-related content is published and hosted.</p><p>Additionally, the Particl team is in the process of improving and optimizing the SMSG network. It is estimated that the marketplace fees (i.e. listing fees) will significantly be lowered due to the more effective SMSG codebase.</p><p>These changes will come gradually within the Beta phase of development of the marketplace as updates get pushed.</p><h3 id=\"product-import-tool\">Product Import Tool</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-nV8MXWfbGAStemdjRDT_EQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Product Import Tool (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>One of the key components of a two-sided marketplace is getting a good amount of sellers and listed products. This is why the new Particl Open Marketplace roadmap for the next few months includes a lot of tools that will make it easier for sellers to adopt the platform.</p><p>One such tool is the Product Import tool. This tool allows vendors to quickly import large inventories from other sources, considerably reducing the time it takes to populate the marketplace when holding custody of large inventories. Without this feature, sellers need to manually add listings one by one, which is a very time-consuming process.</p><p>With this feature in place, sellers are going to be able to import and list large inventories with only a few clicks. Outside sources for inventory importation will include WooCommerce stores and CSV files (spreadsheets). More options are very likely to be added in the future.</p><h3 id=\"qa-section-ask-a-question-to-a-seller\">Q&amp;A Section — Ask a Question to a Seller</h3><p>But a two-sided marketplace being a two-sided marketplace, it also needs a good amount of buyers so that it can reach its full potential. This is where the upcoming Q&amp;A section comes into play.</p><p>This “comment section” will allow anyone to ask questions to vendors before purchasing (or flagging) a product. This isn’t unlike the very popular Q&amp;A section that Amazon has had for some time now, and it goes a great way into giving you information that might be missing from the item’s description.</p><p>This feature, while not a direct line of contact with the seller, will help buyers make more informed purchasing decisions and give a little bit more confidence when buying an item from a complete stranger. The more you know, the better decisions one can make.</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-settings-page\">Particl Desktop Settings Page</h3><p>The Particl Desktop Settings page is a no-brainer. Currently, if you want to change a configuration on your Particl Desktop client, you either have to modify some config file or enter some command inside the console. This works, but since the goal is to make Particl’s user experience as good as possible, it’s definitely not as user-friendly as it should be.</p><p>The Settings page is pretty much what you would expect from a…settings page. It allows you to change various preferences without having to go through the hassle of finding a tutorial on how to find and modify a config file, or find a list of commands to enter in the console.</p><h3 id=\"market-management-tool\">Market Management Tool</h3><p>The Market Management tool is one of the most awaited features of the Open Marketplace, and rightly so. It is what’s going to make all the individual pieces of the marketplace click together and form into a giant distributed network of markets.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-sQWfEk-U6lWzv8ijSfJBng.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Select What Market (or Storefront) to Browse (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>Market Management will allow you to either create a market of your own or connect your client to a pre-existing one. These community markets can be created by anyone and are completely independent of the main interface of the Open Marketplace. In fact, they are powered by completely different sets of market keys, meaning no data can be shared between the different markets. It’s like multi-wallets, but more advanced and for markets.</p><p>On Particl, there are two types of markets: community markets, and storefronts.</p><p><strong>Community Markets:</strong> They are markets on which anyone that has access to it can buy or sell goods and services. They function exactly the same as the main interface of the Open Marketplace, and nobody has any special permission over other users. Not even the market creator. These markets, however, are not enabled nor visible by default. To access these markets, you need to connect your Particl Desktop client to its Market ID.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> The main interface of the Open Marketplace is a community market that’s enabled and displayed by default by the Particl Desktop client.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-Gh6FqychOcQ2f49d-D_laA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Joined Markets (and Storefronts) Page (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Storefronts: </strong>They are customizable community markets on which special permissions can be attributed to various users. In their most common sense, they are storefronts on which a seller can “set up a shop” in such a way that only him (or the people he gives administrator rights to) can publish listings. Anyone with access to a storefront can only buy (or flag) the listings put on there by the owner of the storefront. Storefronts can also be used by communities looking for higher standards in quality on which only vetted sellers could publish listings.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> By default, Particl Desktop has no way to automatically find Market IDs on the network. These keys need to be distributed manually by whoever wants people to interact with a certain market or storefront…unless these markets/storefronts get promoted.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-xEOnXDjpfjoRMz-Gyasahg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Promote a Market or Storefront (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>While Particl Desktop cannot automatically scan and detect community markets, it is still possible to <strong>promote your market</strong> to the network, for a fee. When “promoting” your market (or storefront), your Particl Desktop client broadcasts the Market ID of your market to the network using SMSG. It is then picked up by the other clients connected to the Particl network, and is added to a “market browser”. At this point, a market will act just like a listing. It will show up on the market browser for the amount of time it’s been promoted. Once the promotion period ends, the market disappears from the market browser.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Once a market or storefront disappears from the market browser, it is still accessible to anyone with its Market ID. The only difference is that it won’t be publicly accessible from the market browser itself.</blockquote><p>Anyone with the proper Market IDs of a market or storefront can promote it. All the fees paid to bump/promote community markets are, just like the listing fees, redistributed to stakers.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-5utZ5LvZNv-3EOxW_ueeow.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Create a New Storefront With Logo (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>Storefronts are ideal for sellers with an already established reputation. It allows them to guarantee to their customer base that a given market, thus all products published inside of it, belongs to him. This can easily be done by, for example, displaying the Market ID of the storefront on the seller’s official website.</p><p>Additionally, storefronts allow for a minimal amount of customization/branding (logo, store description, store title) and aggregate all the listings of a vendor to a single point of access This makes it easier and quicker for customers to find what they’re looking for, when they need it.</p><h3 id=\"adjustable-escrow-ratio\">Adjustable Escrow Ratio</h3><p>As it stands right now, Particl’s double deposit MAD escrow system only works using a 100% ratio, meaning both parties need to deposit a security deposit equal to 100% of the value of the item or service being purchased. There’s nothing wrong with that, of course. After all, a 100% ratio does provide the best game-theory for this type of escrow. There might, however, be some circumstances where such an escrow system wouldn’t be ideal.</p><p>Take the example of a well-known seller that’s already trusted by its customer base and runs a storefront on Particl. This seller might want to move some of its inventory on Particl to save on fees and improve the level of privacy for his business as well as his customers. But since that seller is already well-known and has an established customer base, it might not be ideal for both the seller and its customer to front funds in order to cover a double deposit MAD escrow smart-contract. There is already trust that’s been established between the two parties and, since the seller is running a Particl storefront, he can prove ownership of the products being offered simply by spreading his Market ID on his website or social media pages. In that situation, the required security deposits become an unnecessary obstacle for both the seller and the buyer as they do not necessarily require, or want, escrow protection for transactions.</p><p>What an adjustable escrow would mean is that vendors could set up their own escrow ratio preferences from 0% to 100%. In the above example of a well-known seller running a Particl storefront, he could just reduce his escrow ratio to 0%, meaning no security deposit would be required from neither the buyer or the vendor. This, of course, means that buyers would have no recourse against a dishonest seller, but for those already-established sellers with an existing customer base, having the opportunity to not have to advance coins to fund the escrow system would make adopting Particl’s Open Marketplace much more of a no-brainer.</p><h3 id=\"inventory-and-quantity-management-tool\">Inventory and Quantity Management Tool</h3><p>This feature is self-explanatory. There is no way, currently, to manage a wide inventory and add quantities to your listing. Fortunately, the marketplace back-end currently allows for most of it, but it hasn’t been integrated into the Open Marketplace just yet. Note that a relatively fair amount of development is still needed around this feature and it is likely to be released after the Market Management tool.</p><p>This tool, like its name implies, allows vendors to easily manage inventory quantities, manage multiple listings, and etc. Just like the Product Import tool, Inventory Management is going to make it way easier for sellers with large inventories to take the leap and get started selling on Particl without it being a big hassle.</p><hr><h2 id=\"then-what\"><strong>Then What?</strong></h2><p>All of the above-mentioned items are placed into a short to mid-term roadmap, meaning they are likely to be released within the next few weeks and months, depending on the feature. But wait, there’s more to it!</p><p>The Particl team is thinking ahead and has already planned and started doing research on the features that are going to be worked on once the above marketplace development roadmap is completed.</p><h3 id=\"alternative-payment-options-bitcoin-payments\">Alternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments</h3><p>One of the barriers to entry for Particl’s Open Marketplace currently is that it only works with PART, Particl’s native privacy coin. This, of course, is due to the nature of the technology and how the marketplace has to use <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>PART for its privacy and smart-contract capabilities</strong></a>. If it were using Bitcoin, not only would transactions take a considerably longer time due to longer confirmations, but the marketplace wouldn’t be able to offer a private-by-default experience to its users. And if it were using Monero, it would be okay on the privacy side of things, but then the coin couldn’t be used within smart-contracts. The <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>PART coin is a next-generation privacy coin that has both a solid privacy scheme and a flexible codebase</strong></a> which allows it to be used within smart-contracts. As far as privacy coins come, it’s pretty much getting your cake and eating it too! The good stuff…without the limitations.</p><p>But in the end, people want an easy-to-use marketplace with good user experience, and only accepting PART severely limits the number of new users that can be onboarded (that’s because everybody uses Bitcoin, mostly). To address this issue, the Particl team is going to be working on integrating alternative methods of payments, like paying with Bitcoin, for example.</p><p>There are a couple of ways this can be done, either through an atomic swap widget or by integrating a third-party partner. And while the Particl team would like to use an atomic swap solution (research and development on the matter is ongoing at this very moment), a third-party integration might have to be coded in until an atomic swap application is fully ready (and thoroughly tested) to go. There are currently investigations going into this question specifically, and so more details will be able to be communicated in the future.</p><p>It’s important to note though that, regardless of the method chosen to accept different payment methods, the PART coin will always be the coin that settles the transaction in the end. That’s because even though Particl’s Open Marketplace would be accepting Bitcoin, the marketplace Dapp still needs PART to operate as it is the coin that gives it its privacy and smart-contract capabilities. This means any non-PART payments will be automatically converted into a PART transaction, in the background, on behalf of the user. The end result is that the buyer pays with Bitcoin, and the Open Marketplace does all the rest, transferring the Bitcoin into Particl to fuel the escrow contract.</p><h3 id=\"mobile-application\">Mobile Application</h3><p>Another very important upcoming feature is a Particl Open Marketplace mobile application. Indeed, most people now shop on their cellphones, which means downloading a software that requires you to sync two networks (blockchain + SMSG) is definitely a downgrade in terms of user experience. Sure, it provides way better privacy and decentralization, but for most people, this is too weak of an argument against a lazy and fast user-experience.</p><p>And so, to address this issue, the Particl team has scheduled the development of a mobile application. Research is already being put into this item at this very moment, although it is not a top priority for the team right now. That’s because there are still some core features missing to the marketplace (the items in the above roadmap) that need to be added before the team can think of wrapping everything within a mobile application. Once the above roadmap is complete or near-complete, that’s when the Open Marketplace’s mobile application is going to become more of a focus.</p><p>This mobile application will make Particl as accessible as it will have ever been. In fact, most of the world uses cellphones and more and more people now spend more time on their phone than on their computer. To make sure the application has good performance and setup speed, it is more than likely to be a “light wallet”, meaning it won’t require you to download the entire blockchain and SMSG network to function. In other words, this application is intended to be as easy to use as any traditional marketplace mobile application (i.e. Amazon’s application).</p><h3 id=\"developer-sdk-tools\">Developer SDK Tools</h3><p>With bringing more people within the Particl ecosystem in mind, the team has planned for the release of an SDK tool. This tool will be accompanied by various technical documentation that is now currently missing. This will allow outside developers and teams to easily start contributing to the Particl network by developing services, decentralized applications, marketplace features, and etc.</p><p>Because the Open Marketplace is still very much into a heavy development phase, this SDK tool is likely to be one of the last items of this article to see the day. With this in mind, the SDK tool will be going live once the Particl code gets “stable enough” so that it makes sense to commit to a version and write documentation on it.</p><hr><h2 id=\"let-s-wrap-it-up\">Let’s Wrap it Up</h2><p>All of the above-mentioned features that are going to be added to Particl have one thing in common — they are part of a bigger puzzle that’s gonna make the Open Marketplace much more accessible and easy to use for everyone. They all contribute to eliminate the current barriers to entry that makes adopting Particl more complicated for most people.</p><p>Once in place, these should take Particl to the next level, making it a much more credible contender for mainstream adoption. In the meantime, Particl pioneers such as you can still buy and sell anything for crypto, without leaving a trace, using the current version of the Open Marketplace. And since the marketplace is now live on mainnet, new features and improvements can be expected to come out at an accelerated pace!</p><p>Particl is now well on its way on the path towards mainstream adoption. The development team is now a well-oiled machine and is excited to enter this new phase for the Particl project. The base layer is there, now it’s all about putting the last pieces to the puzzle together. This is where it gets exciting and when it starts moving faster!</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-uAgpsfe9xDDVHe1pF6zJdg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure>","url":"http://localhost:2368/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"994d687a-0700-42af-9230-d514c67d48e9","codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5f7e4ca61a93b603e3f767b2","reading_time":16,"send_email_when_published":false,"email_subject":null,"childHtmlRehype":{"html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-r41YvsRXOJyeVDkN_GcTqg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><h3 id=\"new-marketplace-development-update-roadmap\">New Marketplace Development Update &#x26; Roadmap</h3><p>It has now been more than 2 weeks since the Particl Open Marketplace has launched on mainnet. This release has been a historic moment for the project and a huge stepping stone for the upcoming eCommerce revolution that Particl is brewing up.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-QjorfnMkAgAxEXVbGdPndw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl’s Open Marketplace Live on Mainnet ?</figcaption></figure><p>Since that time, the team has certainly not been taking it slow. No, it’s instead been carefully monitoring the community for feedback and comments regarding the overall user experience of this first live version of the marketplace and has started working on several features that are soon going to make their way onto the marketplace. It’s important to remind ourselves that this version of the Open Marketplace is an early Beta version and is in no way the “end” of anything for Particl. Quite to the contrary, it is the beginning of a great journey in disrupting one of the biggest economic sector of the world— the eCommerce sector.</p><p>It’s been mentioned in the past that, as the Open Marketplace goes live on mainnet, it would signify a gradual change of phase for the project. Whereas Particl used to be almost exclusively focused on development, getting a live product means user adoption will now play a more important role. After all, this project has always been about building a product that people could use to address <strong>real-world issues. </strong>It has always been about creating a solution that empowers individuals and enables businesses to reach their full potential. And now that the solution is here, it’s time to get people to use it and benefit from its groundbreaking technology.</p><h2 id=\"now-it-s-adoption-time-\">Now it’s Adoption Time!</h2><p>Ever since the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace, the Particl team has received a huge amount of feedback and comments about the overall user experience. And it is this user experience, the feeling you get when using the marketplace, that is critical in getting new people and businesses to use Particl. It is one of the key factors in determining the “user conversion rate”, or the number of people that become recurring users after trying out the marketplace for the first time.</p><p>Indeed, getting new people to try out the marketplace is one thing, but retaining them as users is a whole other story. Most of the time, people are more than willing to sacrifice their data and even pay higher prices if the user experience is better elsewhere. And besides, you also get one chance at first impressions.</p><p>For this reason, <strong>the new Open Marketplace development roadmap will now be heavily focused on building what needs to be done to make the user experience as good and as accessible as possible. </strong>In other words, each new marketplace feature released within the next few weeks and months will directly contribute in making the user experience better, thus increasing the user conversion rate and allowing more sellers and buyers to be onboarded.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-current-barriers-to-entry\">What are the Current Barriers to Entry</h2><p>Since the ultimate goal of the Open Marketplace is to empower individuals and businesses on a global scale, it’s important to identify what are the current barriers to entry for anyone to start using the marketplace. After that, it’s crucial to identify what can be done about it and then act on it.</p><p>By definition, a barrier to entry is an obstacle or hindrance that makes it hard to adopt a new product. This obstacle can be a technological challenge, difficult government regulations, a steep financial cost, a lack of education about a topic, and etc. In the Open Marketplace’s case, the barriers to entry are mostly <strong>technological</strong>, <strong>financial</strong>, and<strong> educational</strong>.</p><p>That much is made quite obvious when you start to go over the list of the most reported issues, comments, and feedback regarding the user experience of the marketplace since it’s been released on mainnet. When all summarized, most of it can be boiled down to a few main barriers to entry that makes it a bit challenging for buyers and sellers to adopt the platform. Some of the most reported user experience issues include:</p><ul><li>The setup process of the marketplace (it has to be manually enabled) could be improved <strong>(technological barrier)</strong></li><li>Listing fees being too high for large-scale sellers <strong>(financial barrier)</strong></li><li>The double deposit MAD escrow requires a security deposit from both sides <strong>(financial barrier)</strong></li><li>There is no branding or identification option for vendors <strong>(technological barrier)</strong></li><li>The marketplace currently only accepts the PART coin and not Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, or more traditional means of payment <strong>(technological barrier)</strong></li><li>The entire blockchain and SMSG network needs to be synced, which takes a few minutes to do<strong> (technological barrier)</strong></li><li>What needs to be done to complete a certain action isn’t always perfectly clear <strong>(educational barrier)</strong></li><li>How funds move throughout a full transaction process <strong>(educational barrier)</strong></li></ul><p>These barriers to entry are the main obstacles that make it harder for Particl to be adopted to a wider level. As such, solutions to these issues will be prioritized moving forward, and each item contained within the Open Marketplace development roadmap for the next few months is designed to increase the adoption of the Open Marketplace by improving the user experience.</p><h2 id=\"make-particl-as-accessible-as-any-other-marketplace\">Make Particl as Accessible as Any Other Marketplace</h2><p>To eliminate the barriers that make the Open Marketplace hard to adopt for most people, the Particl team has planned and started working on several improvements and features. Each of them is designed to feed off each other and directly contribute to improving Particl’s user experience for both buyers and sellers.</p><p>What follows is an estimated release timeline of the next few features that are going to make their way onto Particl’s Open Marketplace. There’s currently no date or time estimate associated with any of these features, but they’re what’s being worked on at this moment and what is planned to be released in the short to mid-term.</p><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>This development timeline is only an estimation of the order at which features will be released live on mainnet. All listed items are subject to change.</blockquote><hr><h3 id=\"what-s-coming-up-for-particl\">What’s Coming Up for Particl?</h3><ul><li><a href=\"#8c5a\"><strong>User Interface Tweaks</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"#5f27\"><strong>Lowering Marketplace Fees</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"#909d\"><strong>Product Import Tool</strong></a><strong> (1)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#3d73\"><strong>Q&#x26;A Section — Ask a Question to a Seller</strong></a><strong> (2)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#c8cb\"><strong>Particl Desktop Settings Page</strong></a><strong> (3)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#7168\"><strong>Market Management Tool</strong></a><strong> (4)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#e90f\"><strong>Adjustable Escrow Ratio</strong></a><strong> (5)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#3d2b\"><strong>Inventory and Quantity Management Tool</strong></a><strong> (6)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#5a71\"><strong>Then What?</strong></a><br><a href=\"#a7e1\">Alternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments</a><br><a href=\"#c75e\">Mobile Application</a><br><a href=\"#9733\">Developer SDK Tools</a></li></ul><hr><h3 id=\"user-interface-tweaks\">User Interface Tweaks</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-ZdZYzwxy3xJGIyMnGSbIwQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Improved Sell Orders Page (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>The lowest hanging fruit for impoving Particl’s user experience is by making several tweaks to the user interface of Particl Desktop, the client on which the Open Marketplace is hosted.

Currently, if you want to change a configuration on your Particl Desktop client, you either have to modify some config file or enter some command inside the console. This works, but since the goal is to make Particl’s user experience as good as possible, it’s definitely not as user-friendly as it should be.</p><p>The Settings page is pretty much what you would expect from a…settings page. It allows you to change various preferences without having to go through the hassle of finding a tutorial on how to find and modify a config file, or find a list of commands to enter in the console.</p><h3 id=\"market-management-tool\">Market Management Tool</h3><p>The Market Management tool is one of the most awaited features of the Open Marketplace, and rightly so. It is what’s going to make all the individual pieces of the marketplace click together and form into a giant distributed network of markets.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-sQWfEk-U6lWzv8ijSfJBng.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Select What Market (or Storefront) to Browse (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>Market Management will allow you to either create a market of your own or connect your client to a pre-existing one. These community markets can be created by anyone and are completely independent of the main interface of the Open Marketplace. In fact, they are powered by completely different sets of market keys, meaning no data can be shared between the different markets. It’s like multi-wallets, but more advanced and for markets.</p><p>On Particl, there are two types of markets: community markets, and storefronts.</p><p><strong>Community Markets:</strong> They are markets on which anyone that has access to it can buy or sell goods and services. They function exactly the same as the main interface of the Open Marketplace, and nobody has any special permission over other users. Not even the market creator. These markets, however, are not enabled nor visible by default. To access these markets, you need to connect your Particl Desktop client to its Market ID.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> The main interface of the Open Marketplace is a community market that’s enabled and displayed by default by the Particl Desktop client.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-Gh6FqychOcQ2f49d-D_laA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Joined Markets (and Storefronts) Page (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Storefronts: </strong>They are customizable community markets on which special permissions can be attributed to various users. In their most common sense, they are storefronts on which a seller can “set up a shop” in such a way that only him (or the people he gives administrator rights to) can publish listings. Anyone with access to a storefront can only buy (or flag) the listings put on there by the owner of the storefront. Storefronts can also be used by communities looking for higher standards in quality on which only vetted sellers could publish listings.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> By default, Particl Desktop has no way to automatically find Market IDs on the network. These keys need to be distributed manually by whoever wants people to interact with a certain market or storefront…unless these markets/storefronts get promoted.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-xEOnXDjpfjoRMz-Gyasahg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Promote a Market or Storefront (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>While Particl Desktop cannot automatically scan and detect community markets, it is still possible to <strong>promote your market</strong> to the network, for a fee. When “promoting” your market (or storefront), your Particl Desktop client broadcasts the Market ID of your market to the network using SMSG. It is then picked up by the other clients connected to the Particl network, and is added to a “market browser”. At this point, a market will act just like a listing. It will show up on the market browser for the amount of time it’s been promoted. Once the promotion period ends, the market disappears from the market browser.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Once a market or storefront disappears from the market browser, it is still accessible to anyone with its Market ID. The only difference is that it won’t be publicly accessible from the market browser itself.</blockquote><p>Anyone with the proper Market IDs of a market or storefront can promote it. All the fees paid to bump/promote community markets are, just like the listing fees, redistributed to stakers.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-5utZ5LvZNv-3EOxW_ueeow.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Create a New Storefront With Logo (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>Storefronts are ideal for sellers with an already established reputation. It allows them to guarantee to their customer base that a given market, thus all products published inside of it, belongs to him. This can easily be done by, for example, displaying the Market ID of the storefront on the seller’s official website.</p><p>Additionally, storefronts allow for a minimal amount of customization/branding (logo, store description, store title) and aggregate all the listings of a vendor to a single point of access This makes it easier and quicker for customers to find what they’re looking for, when they need it.</p><h3 id=\"adjustable-escrow-ratio\">Adjustable Escrow Ratio</h3><p>As it stands right now, Particl’s double deposit MAD escrow system only works using a 100% ratio, meaning both parties need to deposit a security deposit equal to 100% of the value of the item or service being purchased. There’s nothing wrong with that, of course. After all, a 100% ratio does provide the best game-theory for this type of escrow. There might, however, be some circumstances where such an escrow system wouldn’t be ideal.</p><p>Take the example of a well-known seller that’s already trusted by its customer base and runs a storefront on Particl. This seller might want to move some of its inventory on Particl to save on fees and improve the level of privacy for his business as well as his customers. But since that seller is already well-known and has an established customer base, it might not be ideal for both the seller and its customer to front funds in order to cover a double deposit MAD escrow smart-contract. There is already trust that’s been established between the two parties and, since the seller is running a Particl storefront, he can prove ownership of the products being offered simply by spreading his Market ID on his website or social media pages. In that situation, the required security deposits become an unnecessary obstacle for both the seller and the buyer as they do not necessarily require, or want, escrow protection for transactions.</p><p>What an adjustable escrow would mean is that vendors could set up their own escrow ratio preferences from 0% to 100%. In the above example of a well-known seller running a Particl storefront, he could just reduce his escrow ratio to 0%, meaning no security deposit would be required from neither the buyer or the vendor. This, of course, means that buyers would have no recourse against a dishonest seller, but for those already-established sellers with an existing customer base, having the opportunity to not have to advance coins to fund the escrow system would make adopting Particl’s Open Marketplace much more of a no-brainer.</p><h3 id=\"inventory-and-quantity-management-tool\">Inventory and Quantity Management Tool</h3><p>This feature is self-explanatory. There is no way, currently, to manage a wide inventory and add quantities to your listing. Fortunately, the marketplace back-end currently allows for most of it, but it hasn’t been integrated into the Open Marketplace just yet. Note that a relatively fair amount of development is still needed around this feature and it is likely to be released after the Market Management tool.</p><p>This tool, like its name implies, allows vendors to easily manage inventory quantities, manage multiple listings, and etc. Just like the Product Import tool, Inventory Management is going to make it way easier for sellers with large inventories to take the leap and get started selling on Particl without it being a big hassle.</p><hr><h2 id=\"then-what\"><strong>Then What?</strong></h2><p>All of the above-mentioned items are placed into a short to mid-term roadmap, meaning they are likely to be released within the next few weeks and months, depending on the feature. But wait, there’s more to it!</p><p>The Particl team is thinking ahead and has already planned and started doing research on the features that are going to be worked on once the above marketplace development roadmap is completed.</p><h3 id=\"alternative-payment-options-bitcoin-payments\">Alternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments</h3><p>One of the barriers to entry for Particl’s Open Marketplace currently is that it only works with PART, Particl’s native privacy coin. This, of course, is due to the nature of the technology and how the marketplace has to use <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>PART for its privacy and smart-contract capabilities</strong></a>. If it were using Bitcoin, not only would transactions take a considerably longer time due to longer confirmations, but the marketplace wouldn’t be able to offer a private-by-default experience to its users. And if it were using Monero, it would be okay on the privacy side of things, but then the coin couldn’t be used within smart-contracts. The <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>PART coin is a next-generation privacy coin that has both a solid privacy scheme and a flexible codebase</strong></a> which allows it to be used within smart-contracts. As far as privacy coins come, it’s pretty much getting your cake and eating it too! The good stuff…without the limitations.</p><p>But in the end, people want an easy-to-use marketplace with good user experience, and only accepting PART severely limits the number of new users that can be onboarded (that’s because everybody uses Bitcoin, mostly). To address this issue, the Particl team is going to be working on integrating alternative methods of payments, like paying with Bitcoin, for example.</p><p>There are a couple of ways this can be done, either through an atomic swap widget or by integrating a third-party partner. And while the Particl team would like to use an atomic swap solution (research and development on the matter is ongoing at this very moment), a third-party integration might have to be coded in until an atomic swap application is fully ready (and thoroughly tested) to go. There are currently investigations going into this question specifically, and so more details will be able to be communicated in the future.</p><p>It’s important to note though that, regardless of the method chosen to accept different payment methods, the PART coin will always be the coin that settles the transaction in the end. That’s because even though Particl’s Open Marketplace would be accepting Bitcoin, the marketplace Dapp still needs PART to operate as it is the coin that gives it its privacy and smart-contract capabilities. This means any non-PART payments will be automatically converted into a PART transaction, in the background, on behalf of the user. The end result is that the buyer pays with Bitcoin, and the Open Marketplace does all the rest, transferring the Bitcoin into Particl to fuel the escrow contract.</p><h3 id=\"mobile-application\">Mobile Application</h3><p>Another very important upcoming feature is a Particl Open Marketplace mobile application. Indeed, most people now shop on their cellphones, which means downloading a software that requires you to sync two networks (blockchain + SMSG) is definitely a downgrade in terms of user experience. Sure, it provides way better privacy and decentralization, but for most people, this is too weak of an argument against a lazy and fast user-experience.</p><p>And so, to address this issue, the Particl team has scheduled the development of a mobile application. Research is already being put into this item at this very moment, although it is not a top priority for the team right now. That’s because there are still some core features missing to the marketplace (the items in the above roadmap) that need to be added before the team can think of wrapping everything within a mobile application. Once the above roadmap is complete or near-complete, that’s when the Open Marketplace’s mobile application is going to become more of a focus.</p><p>This mobile application will make Particl as accessible as it will have ever been. In fact, most of the world uses cellphones and more and more people now spend more time on their phone than on their computer. To make sure the application has good performance and setup speed, it is more than likely to be a “light wallet”, meaning it won’t require you to download the entire blockchain and SMSG network to function. In other words, this application is intended to be as easy to use as any traditional marketplace mobile application (i.e. Amazon’s application).</p><h3 id=\"developer-sdk-tools\">Developer SDK Tools</h3><p>With bringing more people within the Particl ecosystem in mind, the team has planned for the release of an SDK tool. This tool will be accompanied by various technical documentation that is now currently missing. This will allow outside developers and teams to easily start contributing to the Particl network by developing services, decentralized applications, marketplace features, and etc.</p><p>Because the Open Marketplace is still very much into a heavy development phase, this SDK tool is likely to be one of the last items of this article to see the day. With this in mind, the SDK tool will be going live once the Particl code gets “stable enough” so that it makes sense to commit to a version and write documentation on it.</p><hr><h2 id=\"let-s-wrap-it-up\">Let’s Wrap it Up</h2><p>All of the above-mentioned features that are going to be added to Particl have one thing in common — they are part of a bigger puzzle that’s gonna make the Open Marketplace much more accessible and easy to use for everyone. They all contribute to eliminate the current barriers to entry that makes adopting Particl more complicated for most people.</p><p>Once in place, these should take Particl to the next level, making it a much more credible contender for mainstream adoption. In the meantime, Particl pioneers such as you can still buy and sell anything for crypto, without leaving a trace, using the current version of the Open Marketplace. And since the marketplace is now live on mainnet, new features and improvements can be expected to come out at an accelerated pace!</p><p>Particl is now well on its way on the path towards mainstream adoption. The development team is now a well-oiled machine and is excited to enter this new phase for the Particl project. The base layer is there, now it’s all about putting the last pieces to the puzzle together. This is where it gets exciting and when it starts moving faster!</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-uAgpsfe9xDDVHe1pF6zJdg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":["kg-card","kg-image-card"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-r41YvsRXOJyeVDkN_GcTqg.jpeg","className":["kg-image"],"alt":""},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"new-marketplace-development-update-roadmap"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"New Marketplace Development Update & Roadmap"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"It has now been more than 2 weeks since the Particl Open Marketplace has launched on mainnet.

There is no third-party or\nintermediary operating it or having any sort of control over its network. It\nuses a mix of P2P and blockchain technologies, meaning that it is exclusively\nrun by its global community of users.\n\nThe Open Marketplace is an equally decentralized application that’s built on top\nof the Particl network. It allows anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and\nservices, physical or digital, regardless of where they are located in the\nworld. And because it is entirely decentralized, there’s no staff or support\nteam to enforce rules and policies.\n\nFurthermore, the Open Marketplace is completely private by default, meaning no\nidentifiable data can be linked to any of its users. Transactions are hidden on\nthe blockchain, images are stripped of their metadata, data exchange is\nencrypted, and you can even connect the marketplace through the Tor network. In\nother words, users of the marketplace are anonymous.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started\nTo download the Particl Open Marketplace, go to https://particl.io/downloads or \nget it directly from Github\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.0.1].\n\nparticl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.0.1]\nYou can't perform that action at this time.

If you have ever run the Particl Open Marketplace on mainnet before, you\n    will need to wipe your existing marketplace database, otherwise, you may\n    encounter errors that will break your experience. The location of your\n    particl-market is dependent on the OS you use.\n\n * Windows:C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Roaming\\particl-market\n * macOS:~/Library/Application Support/particl-market\n * Linux:~/.particl-market\n\n2. To use the marketplace, you need to create a marketplace-enabled wallet. To\ndo that, you need to first create a normal wallet as usual. Then, once that is\ndone, create a second wallet and name in Market. Once generated, that wallet\nwill have the marketplace enabled.\n\nFor a complete tutorial on how to download, install, and setup the Particl Open\nMarketplace, follow this link: \nhttps://particl.news/tutorial-how-to-use-the-private-and-trustless-particl-marketplace-11839ea30e09\n\nFor a Wiki version, follow this link: \nhttps://particl.wiki/prepare-install-marketplace\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to Use the Open Marketplace\nAlthough the Particl Open Marketplace proposes a new and improved way to shop\nand do business online, it isn’t too different than the marketplaces you’re used\nto use.\n\nFor buyers and sellers, the simple process of going through a transaction can be\nsummarized as follow:\n\n * The buyer places an order\n * The seller accepts the order\n * The buyer locks his funds in escrow\n * The seller locks his funds in escrow\n * The seller packages and ships the order. A tracking number can be included at\n   this point\n * The buyer receives the order, inspects it, and marks the transaction as\n   complete\n\nSounds easy? That’s because it is! In fact, the process of purchasing and\nselling something online without sacrificing your data shouldn’t be a chore and\nshould be accessible to as many people as possible. Yet, if you want to have a\nfull breakdown of how to use the Particl Open Marketplace, you can either read \nthis tutorial blog post\n[https://particl.news/understanding-and-use-of-the-particl-marketplace-9866cd8190f5] \nor consult this Wiki step-by-step guide [https://particl.wiki/how-to-buy-sell].\n\nWhat Can You Buy & Sell\nParticl’s Open Marketplace is a two-sided marketplace. By definition, a\ntwo-sided marketplace is a marketplace for “exchange between\n[https://reasonstreet.co/business-model-two-sided-marketplace/]two\n[https://reasonstreet.co/business-model-two-sided-marketplace/] distinct user\ngroups that provide each other with the benefits of a large network\n[https://reasonstreet.co/business-model-two-sided-marketplace/]”.\n\nThat means it is entirely up to the users to figure out what they want to buy\nand what they want to sell, and when demand arises, supply should usually follow\nto fill a void. The best example of a two-sided marketplace is eBay — a\nmarketplace where both sellers and buyers are “customers” of and provide each\nother benefits (the seller provides the buyer with items they’re looking for,\nand the buyer provides the sellers with revenue).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Next?\nThis is only the beginning of a long journey for Particl. This mainnet release,\ndubbed a Beta release, marks the first mainnet iteration of many to come for the\nmarketplace.\n\nIt means a lot of intended features are still not implemented yet, and that a\nlot of improvement will be made along the way. This is why your feedback will be\nextremely valuable. What do you think is missing from this marketplace? How was\nyour experience in a particular situation and how could it be improved?\n\nIn the foreseeable future, the Particl team will be focusing on developing some\nof the core features identified earlier in the year. That includes, but isn’t\nlimited to:\n\n * A mobile application and/or mobile integration\n * The possibility to use other coins on Particl Desktop and/or the marketplace\n * A market management tool allowing for the management of multiple user markets\n * A comment section to allow reviews to be logged in\n * Listing price pegging to allow listings to dynamically adjust their prices in\n   PART\n * And more…\n\nBut for now, it is time to play with the world’s most private and decentralized\nmarketplace as much as possible and observe how it will play out. The Particl\nteam will be on the lookout and will be collecting feedback over the course of\nthe next few days/weeks.\n\nThis important period will certainly help shape the future of the project and\nestablish short to mid-term development priorities.\n\nSo install the marketplace, and let’s get down to business!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-is-Now-Live-on-Mainnet/1-89WBhJh6pZ1PBeAKZB2M3A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>It is finally here!

After years of research, development, fine-tuning, refactoring, and\ncommunity-testing, it is finally ready to be unveiled as the world’s most\ndisruptive and empowering marketplace the world has ever seen.\n\nWhat’s Particl and What’s the Open Marketplace?\nParticl is an entirely decentralized platform. There is no third-party or\nintermediary operating it or having any sort of control over its network. It\nuses a mix of P2P and blockchain technologies, meaning that it is exclusively\nrun by its global community of users.\n\nThe Open Marketplace is an equally decentralized application that’s built on top\nof the Particl network. It allows anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and\nservices, physical or digital, regardless of where they are located in the\nworld. And because it is entirely decentralized, there’s no staff or support\nteam to enforce rules and policies.\n\nFurthermore, the Open Marketplace is completely private by default, meaning no\nidentifiable data can be linked to any of its users. Transactions are hidden on\nthe blockchain, images are stripped of their metadata, data exchange is\nencrypted, and you can even connect the marketplace through the Tor network. In\nother words, users of the marketplace are anonymous.\n\nWhat’s important to note, though, is that the Open Marketplace is still very\ndeep into its development phase. In fact, this mainnet release will mark the\nbeginning of the Beta phase of development. Whereas the Alpha phase was mostly\nfocused on building the base layer of the marketplace, Beta will be about adding\nvarious features on top of it and make it more appealing and easy to use for\nvarious types of vendors and buyers.\n\nSo what does it mean? What will you be able to do with Particl’s Open\nMarketplace once it first comes out? What are going to be the available\nfeatures? This blog post will explain, in details, everything you need to know\nprior to the marketplace releasing on mainnet.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSlick, Modern, and User-Friendly Interface\nOne of the most important aspect of any marketplace or product is the user\ninterface and how easy and seamless it is to use. No matter how many great\nfeatures a marketplace has, consumers will opt for a simpler option if it is too\ndifficult use or too time-consuming to learn.\n\nAnd so, with this in mind, the Particl team has put tremendous focus on the Open\nMarketplace’s user experience and interface. In fact, the marketplace is\nintegrated directly into Particl Desktop, the network’s flagship client, and is\ndesigned in a way that makes it easy for everyone to quickly understand how it\nworks. Forget the usual boring and ugly look of cryptocurrency wallets — the\nOpen Marketplace is not only very pleasant to the eye, it is also a very\nintuitive platform that won’t require you to pull all of the hair out of your\nhead just to figure out how to make it work.\n\nYes, this first version mainnet of the marketplace is a Beta build. Yes, there\nare definitely a lot of improvements that are going to be made so that it can be\n“grandma-friendly”, but as Particl always strives to improve its products on all\naspects, and as UI/UX is one of the top focus of the team, it will keep getting\nbetter and more intuitive over time. According to today’s crypto standards,\nParticl Desktop is damn sexy, but the team’s target is set much higher than just\nbeing “good enough” for the crypto crowd.\n\nBuy Stuff for Crypto\n * No fee\n * No identifiable data generated or collected by any 3rd-party\n * No registration or account creation\n * Full escrow support\n * Untraceable currency transactions\n\nIt is already possible to buy many things with cryptocurrencies, but most\noptions are full of friction and they introduce third-parties back in the game.\nThese options either require you to (1) pay a hefty fee, (2) go through many\nsteps and account registrations, or (3) sacrifice your personal data to some\ncompany.\n\nIn most cases, these options introduce all of the above mentioned issues. In all\ncases, the re-introduction of third-parties into the process is proving to be\nhighly counter-productive and more troublesome than simply spending traditional\ncurrencies. Didn’t we start using Bitcoin because we wanted to get rid of\nmiddlemen? Then, why should we have to crawl back to them when we want to spend\nour coins?\n\nParticl fixes all of that in one big swoop by providing a private-by-default\nmarketplace that allows anyone to safely buy products and services online and\npay for them using cryptocurrencies, but without having to deal with any of the\nthree issues introduced by third-parties mentioned just above. After all,\nBitcoin was initially created to be an ecosystem that’s entirely independent\nfrom third-parties, as demonstrated by Satoshi’s early attempt at building a\ndecentralized marketplace on top of the Bitcoin codebase\n[https://news.bitcoin.com/satoshis-pre-release-bitcoin-code-contains-some-fascinating-findings/]\n.\n\nThe Open Marketplace is entirely decentralized and autonomous, meaning it\ndoesn’t rely on any third-party to operate. The absence of any third-party means\nthat you do not have to pay any fee or sacrifice your personal data in order to\nbe able to use cryptocurrencies as actual currencies.\n\nFor the buyer, that means you will likely get access to more affordable products\nsince vendors do not need to pay any fee, except for a small anti-spam listing\nfee. Keep in mind that some online vendors need to pay as high as 40% fee per\nsale, once every fee is paid. Sometimes, that’s even more. That is always\nreflected in the final price that we all pay when shopping online.\n\nSave time and energy by instantly and directly connecting with vendors that\nalready accept cryptocurrencies. Gone are the days you needed to continually\nbrowse the internet to find a vendor that sells the product you are looking\nfor…and accepts cryptocurrencies at the same time.\n\nSell Stuff for Crypto\n * No fee, except for a small listing fee of a few cents\n * No identifiable data generated or collected by any 3rd-party\n * No registration or account creation\n * Full escrow support\n * Untraceable currency transactions\n\nNow, what if you would like to sell some stuff and accept cryptocurrencies? What\nif you wanted to make a business out of it? There are a few options available,\nbut just like for buyers, they require the assistance of third-parties to\nfunction. This introduces a lot of issues for vendors such as (1) paying very\nhigh fees, (2) requiring a lot of paperwork and sign ups, and (3) sacrificing\nyour business data to some company.\n\nThanks to its decentralized structure, the Open Marketplace fixes the issues\nmentioned above by allowing sellers to earn cryptocurrencies by putting products\nand services up for sale on the platform, but without using of any third-party\nor company. The only fee sellers are required to pay, aside from the usual\ncryptocurrency transaction fee, is a small anti-spam listing fee of a few cents\nper day. Everything else is at a big fat 0% fee. For most people selling online,\nthis is about as big of as deal as it gets!\n\nImagine you’re a seller and paying something like 40% fee per transaction, or\neven “just” 15%. Suddenly being charged ~0% on your sales represents a huge\nopportunity and can change your business around in a major way. Not only can you\nmake much more profit per sale, but you can also reduce your prices to gain a\nnet advantage over your competitors.\n\nAnd, since the Open Marketplace is a crypto-focused two-sided marketplace,\nmeaning the platform is populated by both active sellers and buyers, it is the\nideal place to sell items for cryptocurrencies without having to waste hours\nfinding a target audience that is not only looking for your product, but also\nwilling to spend cryptocurrencies for it.\n\nDouble Deposit Escrow System\nParticl Wiki — Double Deposit Escrow System\n[https://particl.wiki/marketplace#decentralized_escrow]\nParticl's Open Marketplace is a decentralized marketplace built with privacy at\nits core. It offers a low-cost, secure…\n[https://particl.wiki/marketplace#decentralized_escrow]particl.wiki\n[https://particl.wiki/marketplace#decentralized_escrow]\n\n * No fee, except for the usual cryptocurrency transaction fee\n * Infinitely scalable\n * No identifiable data generated or collected by any 3rd-party\n * Privacy-focused\n\nUnlike other marketplaces, the Open Marketplace uses a fee-less and\ndecentralized type of escrow (or resolution center). Just like the rest of the\nplatform, this escrow system doesn’t rely on any third-party for issues to be\nresolved.\n\nIn fact, the Open Marketplace’s escrow system is based on the Mutually Assured\nDestruction (MAD) game-theory and requires both sellers and buyers to make a\nsecurity deposit, on top of the regular payment, into a smart-contract. The\nsecurity deposits are refunded, in full, to the participants when both of them\nmark the transaction as complete.\n\nNot requiring any third-party for the escrow system dramatically increases\nprivacy since no escrow agent can have access to your transaction details,\nconversation history, and tracking information. It allows you to own your data\nby ensuring that none of it can be collected by any party other than the one you\nare transacting with.\n\nParticl’s double deposit escrow system is also almost free to use. Unlike most\neCommerce platform, protecting yourself from a party you do not know or trust\nwon’t require you to pay anything other than a simple cryptocurrency transaction\nfee.\n\nAs a comparison, some marketplaces and online commerce platforms will charge you\na considerable fee, sometimes as high as 20% per transaction, just for using an\nescrow or mediation service. These fees tend to be higher on B2B-focused\nmarketplaces.\n\nTake Your Privacy Back\nParticl Explained - Private Transactions\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd]\nAnonymous transactions, or Anon transactions, as referred to in Particl\nDesktop,\ntake privacy to the next level by not…\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd]\n\n * Untraceable currency transactions\n * No metadata when uploading files (i.e. listing pictures)\n * No identifiable data generated\n * No account creation, registration, or KYC required\n * IP addresses can easily be hidden\n\nYou would think that a decentralized marketplace that doesn’t require any\nthird-party, at any step of the process, would be better at keeping your data\nprivate. That, unfortunately, couldn’t be further from the truth.\n\nIn fact, blockchains are publicly auditable ledgers that permanently record your\ndata. And while data written on a blockchain is usually pseudonymous, it is\nentirely possible to collect, analyze, decipher, and use it. Blockchain analysis\nfirms are getting exponentially better at mining and deciphering data stored on\nblockchains. Some of the largest crypto companies are even doing it out in the\nopen\n[https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/a3bn5e/coinbase-neutrino-former-hacking-team-members]\n. In other words, if you’re worried about how your data is being collected and\nused (hint: and you should be), using a public blockchain might not be ideal for\nyou.\n\nThat’s precisely why the Open Marketplace is private by default. That means you\nwon’t need to do any extra step to protect your privacy and your data won’t be\nout there on a public blockchain for everyone to see and decipher, at any point\nin time. Particl’s Open Marketplace does it all for you.\n\nBy integrating the Confidential Transactions (CT) and RingCT privacy protocols\ninto Particl’s double deposit escrow system, all currency transactions are\nhidden on the blockchain and can’t be traced back to users. Additionally, all\ndata uploaded on the marketplace is stripped of all its metadata so that it\ncan’t be reverse engineered (did you know most pictures taken by phones usually\ncontain a geo-tag?).\n\nThe only privacy enhancing feature that is not enabled by default is the Tor\nnetwork integration. While easy and very quick to set up\n[http://particl.wiki/tor-hs], it requires users to manually enable it. That’s\nbecause pushing automatic updates introduces security vulnerabilities,\nespecially man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.\n\nDecentralized Marketplace Moderation\nParticl Explained - Decentralized Marketplace Moderation\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-decentralized-marketplace-moderation-7daa3c75d5b2]\nTo vote against a specific listing, users need to flag it using the Open\nMarketplace user interface. Once the first…\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-decentralized-marketplace-moderation-7daa3c75d5b2]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-decentralized-marketplace-moderation-7daa3c75d5b2]\n\n * 1 coin = 1 vote\n * Delisting threshold is -9,000 coin weight\n * Provably verifiable\n * Cannot be gamed or produce fake votes\n * No staff with special access or power involved\n\nUsually, to keep marketplaces free of undesirable content, companies use an army\nof moderators and dedicated staff to delete listings and ban users. In the case\nof the Open Marketplace, however, that is impossible as there is no third-party\ninvolved.\n\nParticl instead built a completely decentralized governance mechanism, based on\ngame-theory, that allows anyone in the community to flag undesirable content off\nof the marketplace. The system uses a similar model as the very well known\nReddit model — any user can upvote or downvote a listing, and when it reaches a\ncertain negative threshold, that listing gets deleted from the marketplace. But\nunlike Reddit’s system, which is based on a 1 user = 1 vote basis, the Open\nMarketplace uses a 1 coin = 1 vote basis.\n\nThis system ensures that the Open Marketplace stays clean by employing what can\neffectively become the world’s largest community of moderators. It also ensures\nthat only the users of the platform have an actual say on what content gets to\nstay on there, avoiding troll armies and ill-intended individuals.\n\n> Note: On this first mainnet version of the Particl Open Marketplace, a listing\nwill get taken down entirely once it reaches a negative threshold of -9,000.\nCommunity Proposals\nDecentralized Project Governance Update\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6]\nAs we’ve highlighted in our third Community Update, the Particl team has begun\nworking on the initial version of the…\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6]\n\n * 1 coin = 1 vote\n * Anyone can submit proposals to the community\n * Anyone can vote on proposals\n\nUsing the same system that powers the decentralized moderation system, any\nParticl user can create or vote on a proposal using the Particl Desktop client.\nThis introduces a lot of opportunities for buyers, vendors, and cryptocurrency\nusers.\n\nFor example, this system could be used to reach community consensus on important\ndecisions related to the project. The community could vote on initiatives to\nfund using the common Community Fund\n[https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/address.dws?RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM.htm]\n. Vendors could also make use of this feature to poll their customer base about\nwhat type of product they should be focusing. The possibilities are endless and\nit is entirely up to the community to use the system as they please.\n\nAnd just like the decentralized moderation system, each user carries its own\nvoting weight, as determined by the number of coins they hold. This ensures only\nthose with a stake in the project can have a voice, a concept not too different\nfrom the stakeholder concept in publicly traded companies.\n\nMulti-wallets\nMulti-Wallets on Particl Desktop\n[https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076]\nMulti-wallets are not new to Particl. In fact, they have been available on\nParticl-Qt ever since Particl forked to…\n[https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076]particl.news\n[https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076]\n\nReleasing on mainnet at the same time as the Particl Open Marketplace,\nmulti-wallets allow you to manage multiple wallets within the same Particl\nDesktop environment. In this case, multi-wallets can be compared to ‘user\naccounts’ that are completely independent from each other.\n\nMulti-wallets enable a much better degree of security and privacy as each wallet\nis entirely isolated from the others. That means no information or data\n(purchases, profiles, sales data, transaction details, and etc) can leak from a\nwallet to another. It is impossible, simply by looking into the blockchain, that\ntwo wallets are hosted under the same Particl Desktop instance unless the owner\nof the two wallets has linked them together by making payments to an address\nalready identified as belonging to that user.\n\nMulti-wallets can also be used to manage various profiles on the marketplace,\nseller or buyer, and completely keep your identity private between each of the\nwallets. However, market management and market user management tools will come\nat a later time during the Beta phase of development and won’t be part of the\ninitial mainnet version of the marketplace.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith all of that being said, the Particl Open Marketplace will be the first\nprivacy-focused decentralized marketplace of its kind to ever see the day and\nwill mark an important milestone in the history of online eCommerce. It will go\nlive, on mainnet, on the 12th of August 2019 and will include all features\nmentioned in this blog post.\n\nBut don’t get too complacent, this is just the beginning of one very epic\njourney in disrupting one of the biggest sector of the global economy. This\nrelease will also mark the beginning of the Open Marketplace’s Beta phase of\ndevelopment, and it will only get more interesting and exciting from here on\nout. Moving forward, you can expect many more features to be included to it,\nmaking it a real behemoth in both the blockchain and eCommerce worlds. You can\nalso expect more users to start using it, as well as more third-party\nintegrations to see the day. Suffice to say, there’s a lot of good stuff coming\nup for Particl, and each milestone that will be reached from this point onward\nwill be more exciting than the previous one.\n\nBuckle up, because this train is finally getting moving, and there ain’t no\nstopping after it gets released out in the open!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace---What-to-Expect-on-Day-1/1-gAK1frBqYBuhi6WzZZpftg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Particl’s Open Marketplace is finally just a few days away, within an arm’s reach!

In the case of the Open Marketplace, however, that is impossible as there is no third-party involved.</p><p>Particl instead built a completely decentralized governance mechanism, based on game-theory, that allows anyone in the community to flag undesirable content off of the marketplace. The system uses a similar model as the very well known Reddit model — any user can upvote or downvote a listing, and when it reaches a certain negative threshold, that listing gets deleted from the marketplace. But unlike Reddit’s system, which is based on a 1 user = 1 vote basis, the Open Marketplace uses a 1 coin = 1 vote basis.</p><p>This system ensures that the Open Marketplace stays clean by employing what can effectively become the world’s largest community of moderators. It also ensures that only the users of the platform have an actual say on what content gets to stay on there, avoiding troll armies and ill-intended individuals.</p><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>On this first mainnet version of the Particl Open Marketplace, a listing will get taken down entirely once it reaches a negative threshold of -9,000.</blockquote><h2 id=\"community-proposals\">Community Proposals</h2><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\"><strong>Decentralized Project Governance Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\"><em>As we’ve highlighted in our third Community Update, the Particl team has begun working on the initial version of the…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\">particl.news</a></p><ul><li><strong>1 coin = 1 vote</strong></li><li><strong>Anyone can submit proposals to the community</strong></li><li><strong>Anyone can vote on proposals</strong></li></ul><p>Using the same system that powers the decentralized moderation system, any Particl user can create or vote on a proposal using the Particl Desktop client. This introduces a lot of opportunities for buyers, vendors, and cryptocurrency users.</p><p>For example, this system could be used to reach community consensus on important decisions related to the project. The community could vote on initiatives to fund using the common <a href=\"https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/address.dws?RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM.htm\">Community Fund</a>. Vendors could also make use of this feature to poll their customer base about what type of product they should be focusing. The possibilities are endless and it is entirely up to the community to use the system as they please.</p><p>And just like the decentralized moderation system, each user carries its own voting weight, as determined by the number of coins they hold. This ensures only those with a stake in the project can have a voice, a concept not too different from the stakeholder concept in publicly traded companies.</p><h2 id=\"multi-wallets\">Multi-wallets</h2><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076\"><strong>Multi-Wallets on Particl Desktop</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076\"><em>Multi-wallets are not new to Particl.

In this case, multi-wallets can be compared to ‘user accounts’ that are completely independent from each other.</p><p>Multi-wallets enable a much better degree of security and privacy as each wallet is entirely isolated from the others. That means no information or data (purchases, profiles, sales data, transaction details, and etc) can leak from a wallet to another. It is impossible, simply by looking into the blockchain, that two wallets are hosted under the same Particl Desktop instance unless the owner of the two wallets has linked them together by making payments to an address already identified as belonging to that user.</p><p>Multi-wallets can also be used to manage various profiles on the marketplace, seller or buyer, and completely keep your identity private between each of the wallets. However, market management and market user management tools will come at a later time during the Beta phase of development and won’t be part of the initial mainnet version of the marketplace.</p><hr><p>With all of that being said, the Particl Open Marketplace will be the first privacy-focused decentralized marketplace of its kind to ever see the day and will mark an important milestone in the history of online eCommerce. <strong>It will go live, on mainnet, on the 12th of August 2019 and will include all features mentioned in this blog post.</strong></p><p>But don’t get too complacent, this is just the beginning of one very epic journey in disrupting one of the biggest sector of the global economy. This release will also mark the beginning of the Open Marketplace’s Beta phase of development, and it will only get more interesting and exciting from here on out. Moving forward, you can expect many more features to be included to it, making it a real behemoth in both the blockchain and eCommerce worlds. You can also expect more users to start using it, as well as more third-party integrations to see the day. Suffice to say, there’s a lot of good stuff coming up for Particl, and each milestone that will be reached from this point onward will be more exciting than the previous one.</p><p>Buckle up, because this train is finally getting moving, and there ain’t no stopping after it gets released out in the open!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace---What-to-Expect-on-Day-1/1-cx5kMA6I0j5UIUCKprYfuQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure>","url":"http://localhost:2368/particl-open-marketplace-what-to-expect-on-day-1-c7dd46c46db/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"52b9ba6d-6648-44f4-b2ac-60b858d8d19a","codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5f7e4ca61a93b603e3f767bb","reading_time":11,"send_email_when_published":false,"email_subject":null,"childHtmlRehype":{"html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace---What-to-Expect-on-Day-1/1-gAK1frBqYBuhi6WzZZpftg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Particl’s Open Marketplace is finally just a few days away, within an arm’s reach!

There is no third-party or intermediary operating it or having any sort of control over its network. It uses a mix of P2P and blockchain technologies, meaning that it is exclusively run by its global community of users.</p><p>The Open Marketplace is an equally decentralized application that’s built on top of the Particl network. It allows anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and services, physical or digital, regardless of where they are located in the world. And because it is entirely decentralized, there’s no staff or support team to enforce rules and policies.</p><p>Furthermore, the Open Marketplace is completely private by default, meaning no identifiable data can be linked to any of its users. Transactions are hidden on the blockchain, images are stripped of their metadata, data exchange is encrypted, and you can even connect the marketplace through the Tor network. In other words, users of the marketplace are anonymous.</p><p>What’s important to note, though, is that the Open Marketplace is still very deep into its development phase. In fact, this mainnet release will mark the beginning of the Beta phase of development. Whereas the Alpha phase was mostly focused on <strong>building the base layer of the marketplace</strong>, Beta will be about <strong>adding various features</strong> on top of it and make it more appealing and easy to use for various types of vendors and buyers.</p><p>So what does it mean? What will you be able to do with Particl’s Open Marketplace once it first comes out? What are going to be the available features? This blog post will explain, in details, everything you need to know prior to the marketplace releasing on mainnet.</p><hr><h2 id=\"slick-modern-and-user-friendly-interface\">Slick, Modern, and User-Friendly Interface</h2><p>One of the most important aspect of any marketplace or product is the user interface and how easy and seamless it is to use.

Forget the usual boring and ugly look of cryptocurrency wallets — the Open Marketplace is not only very pleasant to the eye, it is also a very intuitive platform that won’t require you to pull all of the hair out of your head just to figure out how to make it work.</p><p>Yes, this first version mainnet of the marketplace is a Beta build.

In the case of the Open Marketplace, however, that is impossible as there is no third-party involved.</p><p>Particl instead built a completely decentralized governance mechanism, based on game-theory, that allows anyone in the community to flag undesirable content off of the marketplace. The system uses a similar model as the very well known Reddit model — any user can upvote or downvote a listing, and when it reaches a certain negative threshold, that listing gets deleted from the marketplace. But unlike Reddit’s system, which is based on a 1 user = 1 vote basis, the Open Marketplace uses a 1 coin = 1 vote basis.</p><p>This system ensures that the Open Marketplace stays clean by employing what can effectively become the world’s largest community of moderators. It also ensures that only the users of the platform have an actual say on what content gets to stay on there, avoiding troll armies and ill-intended individuals.</p><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>On this first mainnet version of the Particl Open Marketplace, a listing will get taken down entirely once it reaches a negative threshold of -9,000.</blockquote><h2 id=\"community-proposals\">Community Proposals</h2><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\"><strong>Decentralized Project Governance Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\"><em>As we’ve highlighted in our third Community Update, the Particl team has begun working on the initial version of the…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\">particl.news</a></p><ul><li><strong>1 coin = 1 vote</strong></li><li><strong>Anyone can submit proposals to the community</strong></li><li><strong>Anyone can vote on proposals</strong></li></ul><p>Using the same system that powers the decentralized moderation system, any Particl user can create or vote on a proposal using the Particl Desktop client. This introduces a lot of opportunities for buyers, vendors, and cryptocurrency users.</p><p>For example, this system could be used to reach community consensus on important decisions related to the project. The community could vote on initiatives to fund using the common <a href=\"https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/address.dws?RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM.htm\">Community Fund</a>. Vendors could also make use of this feature to poll their customer base about what type of product they should be focusing. The possibilities are endless and it is entirely up to the community to use the system as they please.</p><p>And just like the decentralized moderation system, each user carries its own voting weight, as determined by the number of coins they hold. This ensures only those with a stake in the project can have a voice, a concept not too different from the stakeholder concept in publicly traded companies.</p><h2 id=\"multi-wallets\">Multi-wallets</h2><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076\"><strong>Multi-Wallets on Particl Desktop</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076\"><em>Multi-wallets are not new to Particl.

In this case, multi-wallets can be compared to ‘user accounts’ that are completely independent from each other.</p><p>Multi-wallets enable a much better degree of security and privacy as each wallet is entirely isolated from the others. That means no information or data (purchases, profiles, sales data, transaction details, and etc) can leak from a wallet to another. It is impossible, simply by looking into the blockchain, that two wallets are hosted under the same Particl Desktop instance unless the owner of the two wallets has linked them together by making payments to an address already identified as belonging to that user.</p><p>Multi-wallets can also be used to manage various profiles on the marketplace, seller or buyer, and completely keep your identity private between each of the wallets. However, market management and market user management tools will come at a later time during the Beta phase of development and won’t be part of the initial mainnet version of the marketplace.</p><hr><p>With all of that being said, the Particl Open Marketplace will be the first privacy-focused decentralized marketplace of its kind to ever see the day and will mark an important milestone in the history of online eCommerce. <strong>It will go live, on mainnet, on the 12th of August 2019 and will include all features mentioned in this blog post.</strong></p><p>But don’t get too complacent, this is just the beginning of one very epic journey in disrupting one of the biggest sector of the global economy. This release will also mark the beginning of the Open Marketplace’s Beta phase of development, and it will only get more interesting and exciting from here on out. Moving forward, you can expect many more features to be included to it, making it a real behemoth in both the blockchain and eCommerce worlds. You can also expect more users to start using it, as well as more third-party integrations to see the day. Suffice to say, there’s a lot of good stuff coming up for Particl, and each milestone that will be reached from this point onward will be more exciting than the previous one.</p><p>Buckle up, because this train is finally getting moving, and there ain’t no stopping after it gets released out in the open!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace---What-to-Expect-on-Day-1/1-cx5kMA6I0j5UIUCKprYfuQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":["kg-card","kg-image-card"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace---What-to-Expect-on-Day-1/1-gAK1frBqYBuhi6WzZZpftg.jpeg","className":["kg-image"],"alt":""},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Particl’s Open Marketplace is finally just a few days away, within an arm’s reach!
