As you can imagine, this topic can rapidly\nlead to fiery debates on the level of privacy certain protocol implementations\noffer and as to why a certain currency was designed the way it is.\n\nWe’d like, today, to clarify our position on this topic and detail why we’ve\ndecided to follow this particular path.\n\n> Note: In this article, we often refer to RingCT transactions as “anon\ntransactions\". These are used as synonyms.\nTable of Contents\n * About Particl's Native Currency; PART\n * What are Particl Distributed Apps\n * The Need for Public Balances\n * About Particl’s Privacy\n * How Does RingCT Work?\n * Leveraging Particl Applications to Boost Privacy\n * New Privacy Boons Abound\n * So, Should PART Become Private-by-Default?\n * Particl Desktop Privacy Improvements on the Way!\n * Synergy and Collaboration, not Tribalism and Exclusion\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout Particl’s Native Currency; PART\nBefore we get into the nitty-gritty details as to why PART uses an opt-in\nprivacy setup rather than mandating all transactions to be private, it’s\nimportant to understand the context of PART's existence and know what is its\npurpose within the wider Particl ecosystem.\n\nTaken at face value, PART is a proof-of-stake privacy coin that uses the same\nprivacy protocol as Monero (RingCT) but uses the Bitcoin codebase instead of the\nmore rigid Cryptonote one.\n\nThis difference in codebases makes a world of differences. Indeed, leveraging\nthe Bitcoin codebase enables PART to benefit from the sheer strength of the\nentire Bitcoin ecosystem and developer community. That means more developers\nauditing and contributing to the code (Taproot, LN, etc), more stability, and\nmore products and releases to benefit from (Copay, Electrum, etc). But perhaps\nmore importantly, that also means much more flexibility.\n\nAnd that’s where PART shines uniquely and really sets itself apart from other\nprivacy coins. While it uses the proven-effective but typically rigid RingCT and\nCT protocols, it possesses all of Bitcoin's flexibility; massively expanding its\nutility as more than just a private currency. \n\nThis added flexibility makes it possible to use the coin in simple Bitcoin-style\nsmart-contracts and multi-signature contracts. But don’t get fooled by the word\n“basic”, what can be done with “simple smart-contracts” is pretty astonishing in\nitself as demonstrated by distributed apps like Particl Marketplace\n[https://particl.io/marketplace] (decentralized e-commerce) and the recent\nTaproot developments. More on that shortly.\n\nWhat is PART’s Real Intended Purpose?\nWhen we, the Particl team, first envisioned and designed the Particl project, we\nhad a very clear mission in mind: building an ecosystem of distributed\napplications that respect your rights and freedoms. This is our primary focus\nand all further design decisions follow that guiding line.\n\nWe are building these applications for everyone—freedom seekers, the persecuted\nand censored, big and small online sellers, online shoppers, the “typical\ninternet user”, and, among many other types of people, privacy enthusiasts too.\n\nIn that sense, building a privacy coin that only serves as a medium of exchange\nisn’t our objective. PART is a multi-purpose, privacy-focused currency that is\nmore akin to a tool than only a currency. By design, it needs to be flexible\nenough to accomplish various functions within the Particl ecosystem, which is\nachieved by leveraging the benefits of the Bitcoin codebase.\n\nIt is with this need for both multi-purpose flexibility and privacy that we’ve\ndesigned PART’s privacy setup and why we’re confident that it’s doing exactly\nwhat we intended it to do in the first place.\n\nWhat are Particl Distributed Apps\nTo give you a better idea of our vision, let's take one of the distributed\napplications of the Particl ecosystem. Particl Marketplace is a decentralized\nand private-by-default online marketplace that lets you buy and sell anything\nonline with no restriction. Think of it like an eBay, but without any middleman,\ndata mining, restriction, or sales fee/commission.\n\nThis marketplace is made possible thanks to many pieces fitting together: the\nflexibility of the Bitcoin smart-contracts, the use of a custom and unique P2P\nmessaging layer (SMSG), the privacy benefits of the RingCT protocol, a\ndistributed governance system, the anonymity of the Tor network, and the\nsmart-contract capabilities of the Bitcoin-based CT protocol.\n\nAs PART itself directly powers some of these functions (i.e., content\nmoderation), its multi-purpose nature becomes clearer. And as some of these\nfunctions cannot work using anon balances and transactions, the debate on\nwhether we should mandate private transactions or not suddenly becomes more\nnuanced.\n\nThe Need for Public Balances\nRingCT transactions are, by design, quite rigid as their outputs are not\nprogrammable. This prevents anon balances to be used in more complex scenarios,\non various platforms, and for certain use-cases. To circumvent this limitation,\nParticl leverages both public (Bitcoin-like) and CT transactions\n[https://blockstream.com/bitcoin17-final41.pdf]. This “protocol flexibility” is\none of the coin’s most important strengths and expands its utility beyond what\nit could be if it was working exclusively using RingCT.\n\nWhat are Public Balances Used for?\nAt this time, here’s a list of some components of the Particl ecosystem that\nrequire public balances to function:\n\n * The Particl Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism, including cold staking\n   and cold staking pools. There is, however, an option to receive all staking\n   rewards using RingCT or CT transactions for those looking for that extra\n   layer of privacy. To learn more about how to do this, please refer to this\n   article\n   [https://particl.news/private-cold-staking-script-released-d8900e193490/].\n * Particl's decentralized treasury which funds community initiatives.\n * The community governance system [https://ccs.particl.io/] which allows\n   stakeholders to vote on important decisions with their stake weight.\n * The Particl Marketplace community moderation system which lets the users\n   moderate undesirable content off of the marketplace and fight off spam on the\n   platform.\n * The mobile wallet Particl Copay.\n * The light wallet Particl Electrum (desktop and mobile) which is expected to\n   power future mobile and web releases.\n * Hardware devices such as the Ledger Nano S and the Trezor.\n\nAnd, although Particl Marketplace’s two-party escrow system\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_escrow.html] doesn’t rely\non public transactions, it still requires CT transactions to link RingCT outputs\ntogether to provide its anonymity. You can read more on how this is done by\nchecking out this article\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd/].\n\nAs you can see, many critical components of the Particl ecosystem entirely rely\non public balances and transactions. Making PART private-by-default or outright\nmandating private transactions would cause a significant setback and even force\nthe project to abandon some of its core components. This would go in direct\nopposition of our mission.\n\nWhat About Exchanges?\nAnother downside associated with having a private-by-default cryptocurrency has\nto do with the ever-evolving legal landscape of the blockchain industry. As is\nbecoming more evident by the day, regulations are tightening, notably around the\nuse of “privacy coins”. As a result, a lot of leading exchanges have resorted to\ndelisting and/or not entertaining adding privacy coins as a way to protect\nthemselves and ensure that they remain compliant.\n\nWith Particl’s relatively precarious presence on exchanges, having the main\ntransaction type be transparent is a definite upside.\n\nAnd even though exchanges could, in theory, change the type of transactions they\naccept if Particl were to switch to a private-by-default model, they may not be\ninclined to do so purely based on the fact that PART itself has relatively low\nliquidity and volume. The effort involved with implementing that change at the\nexchange level, coupled with the legal uncertainty of accepting privacy coins,\nmay simply not be worth it for exchanges. This could lead to a delisting and\nreduction of accessibility to the PART coin; something that cannot be neglected\nas the coin needs to be as accessible as possible for Particl to accomplish its\nmission.\n\nAuditing the Circulating Supply\nEverything in life has trade-offs. With cryptocurrencies that mandate private\ntransactions like Monero, the added privacy is counter-balanced by the fact that\nthe circulating supply cannot be properly audited with full certainty. And\nalthough the reasons that may cause supply inflation are usually considered more\ntheoretical than practical, they are real risks nonetheless.\n\nBy having public balances on which people hold funds and stake from, you can\ndetermine, with more accuracy, whether or not the total number of coins in\ncirculation is as expected. As the Monero team best wrote it: “(…) the use of\ntransparent fund migration means that an attempt to move enough exploited funds\nthrough the transparent Zcash pool could be detected (…)”. On that note, we\nhighly recommend reading Monero’s well-thought-out response on the topic of\nsupply auditability [https://www.getmonero.org/2020/01/17/auditability.html],\nhow it relates to private (“opaque”) cryptocurrencies, and the trade-offs\ninvolved with this.\n\nIn our particular case, supply auditability isn’t the main reason why we’ve\nopted against mandating private transactions, but it’s certainly an appreciable\nbenefit.\n\nTransaction Speed\nOne non-negligible benefit of having public balances is the faster speed of\ntransaction settlements on Particl. While both public and anon transactions use\nblock confirmation times of 2 minutes, public balances are usable after 1\nconfirmation (~2 minutes) while anon balances can only be used once the funds it\ncontains have reached 12 confirmations (~24 minutes).\n\nThis speed is handy in many situations and straight up required in others,\nnotably in the context of certain Particl applications where the public balance\nholds a key role (i.e., moderating marketplace content).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout PART’s Privacy\nAlthough PART is a multi-purpose coin that accomplishes different functions\nwithin the ecosystem—and, as we’ve just seen, some of these functions cannot\nwork over anon (RingCT) transactions—its privacy is still one of its most\nimportant selling points and development priorities. \n\nWhen debating whether or not PART should be private-by-default, are we asking\nthe right question? Is the entire debate misdirected?\n\nAt its most fundamental level, this debate seeks to find out whether or not\nPART’s current privacy capabilities are good enough to keep people anonymous.\nWhether or not PART mandates RingCT transactions or not is irrelevant as long as\nthe user privacy is solid enough. \n\nIs Particl private-by-default?\nLet’s first clear this question out of the way. No, Particl isn’t\n“private-by-default”, but it is heavily focused on anonymity nonetheless.\n\nKeep in mind, Particl’s mission is first and foremost to provide an ecosystem of\napplications that respect your rights. The race to the top for the absolute most\nprivate cryptocurrency in the space is not our primary focus and purpose. That\nbeing said, PART absolutely qualifies for a spot within the top privacy coins as\nwe are just about to find out.\n\nKeeping our mission in mind, PART is not dedicated exclusively to privacy\nmaximalists but also to a much wider range of audiences that also include people\nthat may not care as much about this specific aspect but more about others, like\ncutting off the middleman from their e-commerce operations, for example.\n\nBut is opt-in privacy, rather than mandated, an actual threat to the quality of\nthat privacy? Let’s see how RingCT works in the first place so that we may be\nable to answer that question after.\n\nHow Does RingCT Work?\nRingCT [https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf] is a combination of the \nConfidential Transactions (CT) [https://blockstream.com/bitcoin17-final41.pdf] \nand Ring Signature privacy protocols. CT keeps transacting amounts private and\nring signatures keep the identity of the participants private.\n\nWhenever you make an anon transaction, the transacting anon outputs are pooled\nup with other anon outputs on the network (ring signatures). These other outputs\npose as \"fake transaction participants\" and merely serve the role of being\nplausibly deniable decoys to hide amongst.\n\nFor an outside party looking into the transaction, it is theoretically not\npossible to tell, with certainty, which of the “participants” actually\nparticipated in the transaction, meaning that neither the value of the amount\ntransferred nor its participants can be traced. And while academic and\ntheoretical attack vectors do exist, as in every privacy protocol, RingCT has\nproven time and time again to be one of the most robust out there.\n\nWhat Contributes to Greater Privacy?\nTo keep things simple, more anon transactions on the network mean more privacy,\nand that privacy gets even better when there’s a constant flow of new legitimate\ntransactions being created. But let's break that down in more detail.\n\nHow private a transaction is, at the protocol level, mainly depends on two\nfactors. On one end, the sender of an anon transaction can increase or decrease\nthe level of its privacy by using a greater or lesser number of \"ring\nsignatures\". More ring signatures means more decoys participating in a\ntransaction and thus, in simple terms, greater expected privacy.\n\nOn the other end, the total number and diversity of these decoys matter greatly.\nBecause RingCT's privacy is obtained by hiding among decoys, its effectiveness\nincreases when there are more of them, and more of them coming from different\nsources, to pick from.\n\nTo understand this better, imagine that you are the sender of an anon\ntransaction that contains 8 ring signatures. Out of these, 2 of them are real\nparticipants (the sender and the receiver) and 6 of them are decoys. If the\nidentity of 4 of these decoys is known to an outside observer (i.e, an exchange,\na blockchain tracing company, etc), that really only leaves you with 2 decoys to\nhide among, making it easier, in theory, for the real participants to be\nidentified. \n\nThat's why having a large number of outputs and transactions on the network\nimproves your privacy. It gives the protocol more decoys to work with, and more\ndiverse ones, effectively reducing your chances of picking up compromised ones.\n\nOn the topic of the diversity in the source of these outputs, it is also very\nimportant as it reduces the chances of picking up decoys known to third-parties\ncollecting data on large numbers of outputs from a single source (i.e., an\nexchange keeping tabs on all the Monero outputs of its users). Note that this\nbecomes a much bigger problem if and when these parties start collaborating\ntogether and sharing their collected data with each other.\n\nOpt-in Privacy and the Human Factor\nAt the protocol level, RingCT's privacy isn't directly affected by whether or\nnot it is mandated or the default transaction type of the blockchain.\n\nIf, for example, Particl’s RingCT layer had a similar number of transactions per\nday as Monero, it would have a somewhat comparable level of privacy at the\nprotocol level. But, in practice, it gets a bit more complicated because, as\nmentioned earlier in this article, everything has trade-offs.\n\nIn the case of opt-in privacy, the trade-off is the human factor. Having the\nability to switch back and forth between public and anon balances opens the door\nto human errors and sub-optimal protocol usage. As with all cryptocurrencies,\nincluding private-by-default assets like Monero, there are some considerations\nand best practices to keep in mind to maintain a good level of privacy. \n\n> Note: The risks typically associated with the human factor are mostly applicable\nto normal peer-to-peer anon transactions between two users. Using Particl\napplications, like the marketplace, significantly reduces the risk of human\nerror by automatically applying some of the recommended best practices.\nLeveraging Particl Applications to Boost Privacy\nAs previously mentioned, the Particl project is much, much more than just a\ncryptocurrency. It's an ecosystem of distributed apps that respect your rights,\nwith one of these rights being the right to privacy. And that's precisely where\nlies Particl's mind-blowing privacy potential; in its apps!\n\nTo understand why that is, let’s take the Particl Marketplace app as an example\nonce again. It lets you buy and sell anything online with no restriction. It is\nprivate by default, meaning that all payments for goods and services have to use\nRingCT. For sellers, there's the option to pay for their listing fees (listing\nan item for sale on the marketplace) using anon transactions. \n\nAnd thus, each item listed on the marketplace generates at least one\ntransaction, meaning that a seller who wants to list 100 items will generate 100\nunique anon transactions alone plus two other anon transactions per sale (as\nboth the buyer and the seller have to make an anon transaction to complete the\nescrow private smart-contract).\n\nAs is self-evident, simple usage of the Particl apps like the marketplace\ndramatically scales the number of real, \"high-quality\" anon transactions per day\non the network up. To get an idea, simply think of how many e-commerce\ntransactions happen every day on the web. How many items are listed online.\nSure, that's an unfairly large segment to compare Particl to, but just think of\nhow many transactions happen just within the still-very-niche decentralized\nmarketplace segment (i.e., OpenSea). \n\n> \"To hide the signal, you must generate noise\" - Kewde, Particl developer\nAs a reference, Monero does around a solid 16,000 transactions per day at the\ntime of writing this piece. Could usage of Particl Marketplace generate similar\nnumbers? The jury is still out but one can speculate.\n\nAnd the cherry on top? Particl Marketplace, and all future Particl applications\nlike the upcoming BasicSwap DEX, is entirely decentralized and trustless.\nThere's no central party able to collect any data about you, your anon outputs,\nor those of other participants on the network; a very unique advantage of\nParticl over other privacy coins.\n\nIn other words, using Particl applications not only increases the number of anon\ntransactions and outputs on the network, but it also does so in a way that\nimproves the quality and effectiveness of available decoys. As current and\nfuture Particl applications gain more adoption, so does the the level of\non-chain privacy as well.\n\nNew Privacy Boons Abound\nParticl is fortunate to be built on the Bitcoin codebase. Indeed, contrary to\nwhat many think, the Bitcoin codebase is evolving rapidly and is going through a\nparticularly innovative phase. That is especially true of recent progress made\non the Lightning Network and Taproot, both of which innovations are available on\nParticl and enhanced by an extra RingCT bridge for added anonymity.\n\nNot mandating RingCT transactions gives us the ability to leverage and combine\nthese breakthrough developments from the Bitcoin community to massively improve\nParticl's privacy and make its applications better for all. \n\nComplex and Private LN-based Smart-Contracts\nIndeed, recent developments have made it possible to run complex smart-contracts\non the Lightning Network. These smart-contracts can even be deployed using CT to\nkeep the amounts transferred confidential. This is a significant development for\nthe Bitcoin community as it dramatically improves your privacy and opens the\ncoin up to even more use-cases. But there is a small caveat; blinded\nsmart-contracts don't hide the identities of people using them; only the\ntransacted amounts remain confidential.\n\nIf that smart-contract was powering the escrow of some hypothetical marketplace,\nit could be possible to tell the identity of the seller and the buyer of a given\ntransaction. On Particl, the additional layer of RingCT would keep both the\nbuyer and the seller private by letting them enter and exit the Lightning\nNetwork without leaving a trace. \n\nTaproot Scripts\nWith Taproot now being enabled on Particl, new on-chain scripting options have\nbecome available. Taproot enables more advanced, but also more private, complex\ntransactions by combining multiple keys and signatures into one. With it, you\ncan pre-emptively program payments within a group of people and trigger them\nfollowing a set of pre-defined conditions. The resulting transactions look just\nlike any other regular transaction on the blockchain and neither the conditions\nnor the identities of the participants are exposed.\n\nThis opens a ton of opportunities, like for example entering and exiting the\nLightning Network more privately\n[https://learningblocks.io/taproot-and-the-lightning-network-a-match-made-in-heaven/]\n, making Particl's treasury entirely decentralized, making BasicSwap DEX swaps\nwith Bitcoin-based currencies look just like a normal transaction, or even \nmaking some core components of Particl quantum-proof\n[https://youtu.be/gF4Mkkhyz1Q?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61KHzhg3JIJdK08JLSlcLId&t=4291].\nAnd that's just to name a few of the possibilites... \n\n> Note: In both the cases of LN and Taproot, it's important to note that RingCT\ntransactions are not directly merged with LN and taproot, but rather run upon\nentering and exiting the L2 network to break the history.\nSo, Should PART Become Private-by-Default?\nUltimately, there is no right or wrong answer to this debate. With both options,\nthere are pros, cons, and trade-offs. There is no perfect solution; it all\ndepends on the purpose of a specific cryptocurrency and the mission it’s trying\nto accomplish. However, we are highly confident that Particl's current privacy\nsetup strikes the optimal utility/privacy balance for what it seeks to\naccomplish and for who it seeks to accomplish it for. \n\nAnd although PART can be said to be less private than competing privacy coins\nsuch as Monero, an obvious statement considering the difference in the number of\ntransactions between the two networks at this present time, its privacy\npotential is just as solid, if not even better, assuming decent usage of\nParticl's distributed applications and that best practices are followed by\nusers.\n\nPART's public addresses provide a lot of capabilities that are key to Particl's\necosystem and they cannot be readily dismissed. For this reason, and for the\nother reasons mentioned earlier in the blog post, the Particl team does not plan\nto switch to an exclusively private-by-default model of transactional privacy in\nthe foreseeable future. We want to reiterate our strong confidence in our\ncurrent model and are focusing on building applications that will organically\nraise the diversity and number of anon transactions and outputs on the network.\n\nThat being said, we remain open to adjusting our position on this matter in the\nfuture depending on how things evolve.\n\nParticl Desktop Privacy Improvements on the Way!\nThe fact that we embrace an opt-in privacy setup doesn't mean we can't work\ntowards reducing potential mistakes caused by the human factor. \n\nAs such, Particl Core contains a few improvements in the RingCT implementation\nthat mitigate some of the risks introduced by the opt-in nature of PART's\nprivacy setup. \n\nAlso, in the next few Particl Desktop updates, you can expect new\nprivacy-focused UI additions and improvements that seek to reduce the risk of\nhuman errors to a minimum. For example, a simple \"churning function\" that\nautomatically churns your anon outputs (generates privacy-enhancing transactions\n(send-to-self) and creates more noise to hide within) to improve your privacy\nand everyone else's as well. Stay tuned to our weekly development updates\n[https://particl.news/tag/progress/] for more information.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSynergy and Collaboration, not Tribalism and Exclusion\nParticl's purpose is to build an ecosystem of apps that respect your rights and\nis as inclusive as possible. The race to the top for the most private features\non a cryptocurrency is something we keep in mind without prime focus, although\nwe fully believe PART can eventually become as such once the adoption of the\nParticl platform grows.\n\nAs part of this vision, we are working on a cross-chain and private\ndecentralized trading exchange (BasicSwap DEX) that lets you swap different\ncryptocurrencies without the use of any third-party.\n\nThat means you can easily enter and exit the Particl ecosystem using your\nfavorite privacy coin such as Monero, for example, and enjoy the benefits of\nboth chains at the same time. \n\nBy combining Monero's private-by-default currency-focused approach and Particl's\napp-focused vision, you can reach strong levels of privacy few people thought\nwere possible. The trade-offs of using an opt-in privacy coin (Particl) can then\nbe offset by using an opt-out one (Monero) on the platform, just like Monero can\noffset its trade-offs (lack of distributed apps and more rigidity) by bridging\ninto the Particl ecosystem using BasicSwap. A win-win situation for both\nblockchains and a major victory for the people.\n\nOnce the DEX is integrated into Particl desktop client, Particl Desktop, the\nsynergy it creates with other privacy coins will take the entire privacy\nenthusiast community to the next level. You'll be able to use distributed and\nprivate applications without making any security or privacy compromise and by\nusing your favorite coin.\n\nIndeed, synergy, not tribalism, is how we see the privacy coin space evolving to\nthe direct benefit of the people. There are many different approaches to privacy\nand it’s difficult to say which one is the best because, in part, use-cases and\ntarget audiences differ so much. And so, why not combine different options and\nwork in unison towards bringing more privacy to the average joe? That's what we\nset out to do with Particl, and what we'll keep giving our blood, sweat, and\ntears to day after day!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJoin the discussion\nWhat's your stance?

Indeed, leveraging the Bitcoin codebase enables PART to benefit from the sheer strength of the entire Bitcoin ecosystem and developer community. That means more developers auditing and contributing to the code (Taproot, LN, etc), more stability, and more products and releases to benefit from (Copay, Electrum, etc). But perhaps more importantly, that also means much more flexibility.</p><p>And that’s where PART shines uniquely and really sets itself apart from other privacy coins. While it uses the proven-effective but typically rigid RingCT and CT protocols, it possesses all of Bitcoin's flexibility; massively expanding its utility as more than just a private currency. </p><p>This added flexibility makes it possible to use the coin in simple Bitcoin-style smart-contracts and multi-signature contracts. But don’t get fooled by the word “basic”, what can be done with “simple smart-contracts” is pretty astonishing in itself as demonstrated by distributed apps like <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</a> (decentralized e-commerce) and the recent Taproot developments. More on that shortly.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-part-s-real-intended-purpose\">What is PART’s Real Intended Purpose?</h3><p>When we, the Particl team, first envisioned and designed the Particl project, we had a very clear mission in mind: building an ecosystem of distributed applications that respect your rights and freedoms. This is our primary focus and all further design decisions follow that guiding line.</p><p>We are building these applications for everyone—freedom seekers, the persecuted and censored, big and small online sellers, online shoppers, the “typical internet user”, and, among many other types of people, privacy enthusiasts too.</p><p>In that sense, building a privacy coin that only serves as a medium of exchange isn’t our objective. PART is a multi-purpose, privacy-focused currency that is more akin to a tool than only a currency. By design, it needs to be flexible enough to accomplish various functions within the Particl ecosystem, which is achieved by leveraging the benefits of the Bitcoin codebase.</p><p>It is with this need for both multi-purpose flexibility and privacy that we’ve designed PART’s privacy setup and why we’re confident that it’s doing exactly what we intended it to do in the first place.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-particl-distributed-apps\">What are Particl Distributed Apps</h2><p>To give you a better idea of our vision, let's take one of the distributed applications of the Particl ecosystem. Particl Marketplace is a decentralized and private-by-default online marketplace that lets you buy and sell anything online with no restriction. Think of it like an eBay, but without any middleman, data mining, restriction, or sales fee/commission.</p><p>This marketplace is made possible thanks to many pieces fitting together: the flexibility of the Bitcoin smart-contracts, the use of a custom and unique P2P messaging layer (SMSG), the privacy benefits of the RingCT protocol, a distributed governance system, the anonymity of the Tor network, and the smart-contract capabilities of the Bitcoin-based CT protocol.</p><p>As PART itself directly powers some of these functions (i.e., content moderation), its multi-purpose nature becomes clearer. And as some of these functions cannot work using anon balances and transactions, the debate on whether we should mandate private transactions or not suddenly becomes more nuanced.</p><h2 id=\"the-need-for-public-balances\">The Need for Public Balances</h2><p>RingCT transactions are, by design, quite rigid as their outputs are not programmable. This prevents anon balances to be used in more complex scenarios, on various platforms, and for certain use-cases. To circumvent this limitation, Particl leverages both public (Bitcoin-like) and <a href=\"https://blockstream.com/bitcoin17-final41.pdf\">CT transactions</a>. This “protocol flexibility” is one of the coin’s most important strengths and expands its utility beyond what it could be if it was working exclusively using RingCT.</p><h3 id=\"what-are-public-balances-used-for\">What are Public Balances Used for?</h3><p>At this time, here’s a list of some components of the Particl ecosystem that require public balances to function:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Particl Proof-of-Stake (PPoS)</strong> consensus mechanism, including cold staking and cold staking pools. There is, however, an option to receive all staking rewards using RingCT or CT transactions for those looking for that extra layer of privacy. To learn more about how to do this, please refer to <a href=\"https://particl.news/private-cold-staking-script-released-d8900e193490/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>this article</strong></a>.</li><li>Particl's <strong>decentralized treasury</strong> which funds community initiatives.</li><li>The <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>community governance system</strong></a> which allows stakeholders to vote on important decisions with their stake weight.</li><li>The <strong>Particl Marketplace</strong> <strong>community moderation system</strong> which lets the users moderate undesirable content off of the marketplace and fight off spam on the platform.</li><li>The <strong>mobile wallet Particl Copay</strong>.</li><li>The <strong>light wallet Particl Electrum</strong> (desktop and mobile) which is expected to power future mobile and web releases.</li><li><strong>Hardware devices</strong> such as the Ledger Nano S and the Trezor.</li></ul><p>And, although Particl Marketplace’s <a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_escrow.html\">two-party escrow system</a> doesn’t rely on public transactions, it still requires CT transactions to link RingCT outputs together to provide its anonymity. You can read more on how this is done by checking out <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>this article</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>As you can see, many critical components of the Particl ecosystem entirely rely on public balances and transactions. Making PART private-by-default or outright mandating private transactions would cause a significant setback and even force the project to abandon some of its core components. This would go in direct opposition of our mission.</p><h3 id=\"what-about-exchanges\">What About Exchanges?</h3><p>Another downside associated with having a private-by-default cryptocurrency has to do with the ever-evolving legal landscape of the blockchain industry. As is becoming more evident by the day, regulations are tightening, notably around the use of “privacy coins”. As a result, a lot of leading exchanges have resorted to delisting and/or not entertaining adding privacy coins as a way to protect themselves and ensure that they remain compliant.</p><p>With Particl’s relatively precarious presence on exchanges, having the main transaction type be transparent is a definite upside.</p><p>And even though exchanges could, in theory, change the type of transactions they accept if Particl were to switch to a private-by-default model, they may not be inclined to do so purely based on the fact that PART itself has relatively low liquidity and volume. The effort involved with implementing that change at the exchange level, coupled with the legal uncertainty of accepting privacy coins, may simply not be worth it for exchanges. This could lead to a delisting and reduction of accessibility to the PART coin; something that cannot be neglected as the coin needs to be as accessible as possible for Particl to accomplish its mission.</p><h3 id=\"auditing-the-circulating-supply\">Auditing the Circulating Supply</h3><p>Everything in life has trade-offs. With cryptocurrencies that mandate private transactions like Monero, the added privacy is counter-balanced by the fact that the circulating supply cannot be properly audited with full certainty. And although the reasons that may cause supply inflation are usually considered more theoretical than practical, they are real risks nonetheless.</p><p>By having public balances on which people hold funds and stake from, you can determine, with more accuracy, whether or not the total number of coins in circulation is as expected. As the Monero team best wrote it: <em>“(…) the use of transparent fund migration means that an attempt to move enough exploited funds through the transparent Zcash pool could be detected (…)”</em>. On that note, we highly recommend reading <a href=\"https://www.getmonero.org/2020/01/17/auditability.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>Monero’s well-thought-out response on the topic of supply auditability</strong></a>, how it relates to private (“opaque”) cryptocurrencies, and the trade-offs involved with this.</p><p>In our particular case, supply auditability isn’t the main reason why we’ve opted against mandating private transactions, but it’s certainly an appreciable benefit.</p><h3 id=\"transaction-speed\">Transaction Speed</h3><p>One non-negligible benefit of having public balances is the faster speed of transaction settlements on Particl. While both public and anon transactions use block confirmation times of 2 minutes, public balances are usable after 1 confirmation (~2 minutes) while anon balances can only be used once the funds it contains have reached 12 confirmations (~24 minutes).</p><p>This speed is handy in many situations and straight up required in others, notably in the context of certain Particl applications where the public balance holds a key role (i.e., moderating marketplace content).</p><hr><h2 id=\"about-part-s-privacy\">About PART’s Privacy</h2><p>Although PART is a multi-purpose coin that accomplishes different functions within the ecosystem—and, as we’ve just seen, some of these functions cannot work over anon (RingCT) transactions—its privacy is still one of its most important selling points and development priorities. </p><p>When debating whether or not PART should be private-by-default, are we asking the right question? Is the entire debate misdirected?</p><p>At its most fundamental level, this debate seeks to find out whether or not PART’s current privacy capabilities are good enough to keep people anonymous. Whether or not PART mandates RingCT transactions or not is irrelevant as long as the user privacy is solid enough. </p><h3 id=\"is-particl-private-by-default\">Is Particl private-by-default?</h3><p>Let’s first clear this question out of the way. No, Particl isn’t “private-by-default”, but it is heavily focused on anonymity nonetheless.</p><p>Keep in mind, <strong>Particl’s mission is first and foremost to provide an ecosystem of applications that respect your rights.</strong> The race to the top for the absolute most private cryptocurrency in the space is not our primary focus and purpose. That being said, PART absolutely qualifies for a spot within the top privacy coins as we are just about to find out.</p><p>Keeping our mission in mind, PART is not dedicated exclusively to privacy maximalists but also to a much wider range of audiences that also include people that may not care as much about this specific aspect but more about others, like cutting off the middleman from their e-commerce operations, for example.</p><p>But is opt-in privacy, rather than mandated, an actual threat to the quality of that privacy? Let’s see how RingCT works in the first place so that we may be able to answer that question after.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-ringct-work\">How Does RingCT Work?</h2><p><a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf\">RingCT</a> is a combination of the <a href=\"https://blockstream.com/bitcoin17-final41.pdf\">Confidential Transactions (CT)</a> and Ring Signature privacy protocols. CT keeps transacting amounts private and ring signatures keep the identity of the participants private.</p><p>Whenever you make an anon transaction, the transacting anon outputs are pooled up with other anon outputs on the network (ring signatures). These other outputs pose as \"fake transaction participants\" and merely serve the role of being plausibly deniable decoys to hide amongst.</p><p>For an outside party looking into the transaction, it is theoretically not possible to tell, with certainty, which of the “participants” actually participated in the transaction, meaning that neither the value of the amount transferred nor its participants can be traced. And while academic and theoretical attack vectors do exist, as in every privacy protocol, RingCT has proven time and time again to be one of the most robust out there.</p><h3 id=\"what-contributes-to-greater-privacy\">What Contributes to Greater Privacy?</h3><p>To keep things simple, more anon transactions on the network mean more privacy, and that privacy gets even better when there’s a constant flow of new legitimate transactions being created. But let's break that down in more detail.</p><p>How private a transaction is, at the protocol level, mainly depends on two factors. On one end, the sender of an anon transaction can increase or decrease the level of its privacy by using a greater or lesser number of \"ring signatures\". More ring signatures means more decoys participating in a transaction and thus, in simple terms, greater expected privacy.</p><p>On the other end, the total number and diversity of these decoys matter greatly. Because RingCT's privacy is obtained by hiding among decoys, its effectiveness increases when there are more of them, and more of them coming from different sources, to pick from.</p><p>To understand this better, imagine that you are the sender of an anon transaction that contains 8 ring signatures. Out of these, 2 of them are real participants (the sender and the receiver) and 6 of them are decoys. If the identity of 4 of these decoys is known to an outside observer (i.e, an exchange, a blockchain tracing company, etc), that really only leaves you with 2 decoys to hide among, making it easier, in theory, for the real participants to be identified. </p><p>That's why having a large number of outputs and transactions on the network improves your privacy. It gives the protocol more decoys to work with, and more diverse ones, effectively reducing your chances of picking up compromised ones.</p><p>On the topic of the diversity in the source of these outputs, it is also very important as it reduces the chances of picking up decoys known to third-parties collecting data on large numbers of outputs from a single source (i.e., an exchange keeping tabs on all the Monero outputs of its users). Note that this becomes a much bigger problem if and when these parties start collaborating together and sharing their collected data with each other.</p><h3 id=\"opt-in-privacy-and-the-human-factor\">Opt-in Privacy and the Human Factor</h3><p>At the protocol level, RingCT's privacy isn't directly affected by whether or not it is mandated or the default transaction type of the blockchain.</p><p>If, for example, Particl’s RingCT layer had a similar number of transactions per day as Monero, it would have a somewhat comparable level of privacy <strong>at the protocol level</strong>. But, in practice, it gets a bit more complicated because, as mentioned earlier in this article, everything has trade-offs.</p><p>In the case of opt-in privacy, the trade-off is the human factor. Having the ability to switch back and forth between public and anon balances opens the door to human errors and sub-optimal protocol usage. As with all cryptocurrencies, including private-by-default assets like Monero, there are some considerations and best practices to keep in mind to maintain a good level of privacy. </p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> The risks typically associated with the human factor are mostly applicable to normal peer-to-peer anon transactions between two users. Using Particl applications, like the marketplace, significantly reduces the risk of human error by automatically applying some of the recommended best practices.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"leveraging-particl-applications-to-boost-privacy\">Leveraging Particl Applications to Boost Privacy</h2><p>As previously mentioned, the Particl project is much, much more than just a cryptocurrency. It's an ecosystem of distributed apps that respect your rights, with one of these rights being the right to privacy. And that's precisely where lies Particl's mind-blowing privacy potential; in its apps!</p><p>To understand why that is, let’s take the Particl Marketplace app as an example once again. It lets you buy and sell anything online with no restriction. It is private by default, meaning that all payments for goods and services have to use RingCT. For sellers, there's the option to pay for their listing fees (listing an item for sale on the marketplace) using anon transactions. </p><p>And thus, each item listed on the marketplace generates at least one transaction, meaning that a seller who wants to list 100 items will generate 100 unique anon transactions alone plus two other anon transactions per sale (as both the buyer and the seller have to make an anon transaction to complete the escrow private smart-contract).</p><p>As is self-evident, simple usage of the Particl apps like the marketplace dramatically scales the number of real, \"high-quality\" anon transactions per day on the network up. To get an idea, simply think of how many e-commerce transactions happen every day on the web. How many items are listed online. Sure, that's an unfairly large segment to compare Particl to, but just think of how many transactions happen just within the still-very-niche decentralized marketplace segment (i.e., OpenSea). </p><blockquote><em>\"To hide the signal, you must generate noise\"</em> - Kewde, Particl developer</blockquote><p>As a reference, Monero does around a solid 16,000 transactions per day at the time of writing this piece. Could usage of Particl Marketplace generate similar numbers? The jury is still out but one can speculate.</p><p>And the cherry on top? Particl Marketplace, and all future Particl applications like the upcoming BasicSwap DEX, is entirely decentralized and trustless. There's no central party able to collect any data about you, your anon outputs, or those of other participants on the network; a very unique advantage of Particl over other privacy coins.</p><p>In other words, using Particl applications not only increases the number of anon transactions and outputs on the network, but it also does so in a way that improves the quality and effectiveness of available decoys. As current and future Particl applications gain more adoption, so does the the level of on-chain privacy as well.</p><h2 id=\"new-privacy-boons-abound\">New Privacy Boons Abound</h2><p>Particl is fortunate to be built on the Bitcoin codebase. Indeed, contrary to what many think, the Bitcoin codebase is evolving rapidly and is going through a particularly innovative phase. That is especially true of recent progress made on the Lightning Network and Taproot, both of which innovations are available on Particl and enhanced by an extra RingCT bridge for added anonymity.</p><p>Not mandating RingCT transactions gives us the ability to leverage and combine these breakthrough developments from the Bitcoin community to massively improve Particl's privacy and make its applications better for all. </p><p><strong>Complex and Private LN-based Smart-Contracts</strong><br>Indeed, recent developments have made it possible to run complex smart-contracts on the Lightning Network. These smart-contracts can even be deployed using CT to keep the amounts transferred confidential. This is a significant development for the Bitcoin community as it dramatically improves your privacy and opens the coin up to even more use-cases. But there is a small caveat; blinded smart-contracts don't hide the identities of people using them; only the transacted amounts remain confidential.</p><p>If that smart-contract was powering the escrow of some hypothetical marketplace, it could be possible to tell the identity of the seller and the buyer of a given transaction. On Particl, the additional layer of RingCT would keep both the buyer and the seller private by letting them enter and exit the Lightning Network without leaving a trace. </p><p><strong>Taproot Scripts</strong><br>With Taproot now being enabled on Particl, new on-chain scripting options have become available. Taproot enables more advanced, but also more private, complex transactions by combining multiple keys and signatures into one. With it, you can pre-emptively program payments within a group of people and trigger them following a set of pre-defined conditions. The resulting transactions look just like any other regular transaction on the blockchain and neither the conditions nor the identities of the participants are exposed.  </p><p>This opens a ton of opportunities, like for example <a href=\"https://learningblocks.io/taproot-and-the-lightning-network-a-match-made-in-heaven/\">entering and exiting the Lightning Network more privately</a>, making Particl's treasury entirely decentralized, making BasicSwap DEX swaps with Bitcoin-based currencies look just like a normal transaction, or even <a href=\"https://youtu.be/gF4Mkkhyz1Q?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61KHzhg3JIJdK08JLSlcLId&amp;t=4291\">making some core components of Particl quantum-proof</a>. And that's just to name a few of the possibilites... </p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> In both the cases of LN and Taproot, it's important to note that RingCT transactions are not directly merged with LN and taproot, but rather run upon entering and exiting the L2 network to break the history.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"so-should-part-become-private-by-default\">So, Should PART Become Private-by-Default?</h2><p>Ultimately, there is no right or wrong answer to this debate. With both options, there are pros, cons, and trade-offs. There is no perfect solution; it all depends on the purpose of a specific cryptocurrency and the mission it’s trying to accomplish. However, we are highly confident that Particl's current privacy setup strikes the optimal utility/privacy balance for what it seeks to accomplish and for who it seeks to accomplish it for. </p><p>And although PART can be said to be less private than competing privacy coins such as Monero, an obvious statement considering the difference in the number of transactions between the two networks <strong>at this present time</strong>, its privacy potential is just as solid, if not even better, assuming decent usage of Particl's distributed applications and that best practices are followed by users.</p><p>PART's public addresses provide a lot of capabilities that are key to Particl's ecosystem and they cannot be readily dismissed. For this reason, and for the other reasons mentioned earlier in the blog post, <strong>the Particl team does not plan to switch to an exclusively private-by-default model of transactional privacy in the foreseeable future</strong>. We want to reiterate our strong confidence in our current model and are focusing on building applications that will organically raise the diversity and number of anon transactions and outputs on the network.</p><p>That being said, we remain open to adjusting our position on this matter in the future depending on how things evolve.</p><h2 id=\"particl-desktop-privacy-improvements-on-the-way-\">Particl Desktop Privacy Improvements on the Way!</h2><p>The fact that we embrace an opt-in privacy setup doesn't mean we can't work towards reducing potential mistakes caused by the human factor. </p><p>As such, Particl Core contains a few improvements in the RingCT implementation that mitigate some of the risks introduced by the opt-in nature of PART's privacy setup. </p><p>Also, <strong>in the next few Particl Desktop updates</strong>, you can expect new privacy-focused UI additions and improvements that seek to reduce the risk of human errors to a minimum. For example, a simple \"churning function\" that automatically churns your anon outputs (generates privacy-enhancing transactions (send-to-self) and creates more noise to hide within) to improve your privacy and everyone else's as well. Stay tuned to our <a href=\"https://particl.news/tag/progress/\"><strong>weekly development updates</strong></a> for more information.</p><hr><h2 id=\"synergy-and-collaboration-not-tribalism-and-exclusion\">Synergy and Collaboration, not Tribalism and Exclusion</h2><p>Particl's purpose is to build an ecosystem of apps that respect your rights and is as inclusive as possible. The race to the top for the most private features on a cryptocurrency is something we keep in mind without prime focus, although we fully believe PART can eventually become as such once the adoption of the Particl platform grows.</p><p>As part of this vision, we are working on a cross-chain and private decentralized trading exchange (BasicSwap DEX) that lets you swap different cryptocurrencies without the use of any third-party.</p><p>That means you can easily enter and exit the Particl ecosystem using your favorite privacy coin such as Monero, for example, and enjoy the benefits of both chains at the same time. </p><p>By combining Monero's private-by-default currency-focused approach and Particl's app-focused vision, you can reach strong levels of privacy few people thought were possible. The trade-offs of using an opt-in privacy coin (Particl) can then be offset by using an opt-out one (Monero) on the platform, just like Monero can offset its trade-offs (lack of distributed apps and more rigidity) by bridging into the Particl ecosystem using BasicSwap. A win-win situation for both blockchains and a major victory for the people.</p><p>Once the DEX is integrated into Particl desktop client, Particl Desktop, the synergy it creates with other privacy coins will take the entire privacy enthusiast community to the next level. You'll be able to use distributed and private applications without making any security or privacy compromise and by using your favorite coin.</p><p>Indeed, synergy, not tribalism, is how we see the privacy coin space evolving to the direct benefit of the people. There are many different approaches to privacy and it’s difficult to say which one is the best because, in part, use-cases and target audiences differ so much. And so, why not combine different options and work in unison towards bringing more privacy to the average joe? That's what we set out to do with Particl, and what we'll keep giving our blood, sweat, and tears to day after day!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr>\n<h3 id=\"join-the-discussion\">Join the discussion</h3>\n<p>What's your stance?

These are used as synonyms.</em></blockquote><h3 id=\"table-of-contents\">Table of Contents</h3><ul><li><a href=\"#about-particl-s-native-currency-part\">About Particl's Native Currency; PART</a></li><li><a href=\"#what-are-particl-distributed-apps\">What are Particl Distributed Apps</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-need-for-public-balances\">The Need for Public Balances</a></li><li><a href=\"#about-part-s-privacy\">About Particl’s Privacy</a></li><li><a href=\"#how-does-ringct-work\">How Does RingCT Work?</a></li><li><a href=\"#leveraging-particl-applications-to-boost-privacy\">Leveraging Particl Applications to Boost Privacy</a></li><li><a href=\"#new-privacy-boons-abound\">New Privacy Boons Abound</a></li><li><a href=\"#so-should-part-become-private-by-default\">So, Should PART Become Private-by-Default?</a></li><li><a href=\"#particl-desktop-privacy-improvements-on-the-way-\">Particl Desktop Privacy Improvements on the Way!</a></li><li><a href=\"#synergy-and-collaboration-not-tribalism-and-exclusion\">Synergy and Collaboration, not Tribalism and Exclusion</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id=\"about-particl-s-native-currency-part\">About Particl’s Native Currency; PART</h2><p>Before we get into the nitty-gritty details as to why PART uses an opt-in privacy setup rather than mandating all transactions to be private, it’s important to understand the context of PART's existence and know what is its purpose within the wider Particl ecosystem.</p><p>Taken at face value, PART is a proof-of-stake privacy coin that uses the same privacy protocol as Monero (RingCT) but uses the Bitcoin codebase instead of the more rigid Cryptonote one.</p><p>This difference in codebases makes a world of differences. Indeed, leveraging the Bitcoin codebase enables PART to benefit from the sheer strength of the entire Bitcoin ecosystem and developer community. That means more developers auditing and contributing to the code (Taproot, LN, etc), more stability, and more products and releases to benefit from (Copay, Electrum, etc). But perhaps more importantly, that also means much more flexibility.</p><p>And that’s where PART shines uniquely and really sets itself apart from other privacy coins. While it uses the proven-effective but typically rigid RingCT and CT protocols, it possesses all of Bitcoin's flexibility; massively expanding its utility as more than just a private currency. </p><p>This added flexibility makes it possible to use the coin in simple Bitcoin-style smart-contracts and multi-signature contracts. But don’t get fooled by the word “basic”, what can be done with “simple smart-contracts” is pretty astonishing in itself as demonstrated by distributed apps like <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</a> (decentralized e-commerce) and the recent Taproot developments. More on that shortly.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-part-s-real-intended-purpose\">What is PART’s Real Intended Purpose?</h3><p>When we, the Particl team, first envisioned and designed the Particl project, we had a very clear mission in mind: building an ecosystem of distributed applications that respect your rights and freedoms. This is our primary focus and all further design decisions follow that guiding line.</p><p>We are building these applications for everyone—freedom seekers, the persecuted and censored, big and small online sellers, online shoppers, the “typical internet user”, and, among many other types of people, privacy enthusiasts too.</p><p>In that sense, building a privacy coin that only serves as a medium of exchange isn’t our objective. PART is a multi-purpose, privacy-focused currency that is more akin to a tool than only a currency. By design, it needs to be flexible enough to accomplish various functions within the Particl ecosystem, which is achieved by leveraging the benefits of the Bitcoin codebase.</p><p>It is with this need for both multi-purpose flexibility and privacy that we’ve designed PART’s privacy setup and why we’re confident that it’s doing exactly what we intended it to do in the first place.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-particl-distributed-apps\">What are Particl Distributed Apps</h2><p>To give you a better idea of our vision, let's take one of the distributed applications of the Particl ecosystem. Particl Marketplace is a decentralized and private-by-default online marketplace that lets you buy and sell anything online with no restriction. Think of it like an eBay, but without any middleman, data mining, restriction, or sales fee/commission.</p><p>This marketplace is made possible thanks to many pieces fitting together: the flexibility of the Bitcoin smart-contracts, the use of a custom and unique P2P messaging layer (SMSG), the privacy benefits of the RingCT protocol, a distributed governance system, the anonymity of the Tor network, and the smart-contract capabilities of the Bitcoin-based CT protocol.</p><p>As PART itself directly powers some of these functions (i.e., content moderation), its multi-purpose nature becomes clearer. And as some of these functions cannot work using anon balances and transactions, the debate on whether we should mandate private transactions or not suddenly becomes more nuanced.</p><h2 id=\"the-need-for-public-balances\">The Need for Public Balances</h2><p>RingCT transactions are, by design, quite rigid as their outputs are not programmable. This prevents anon balances to be used in more complex scenarios, on various platforms, and for certain use-cases. To circumvent this limitation, Particl leverages both public (Bitcoin-like) and <a href=\"https://blockstream.com/bitcoin17-final41.pdf\">CT transactions</a>. This “protocol flexibility” is one of the coin’s most important strengths and expands its utility beyond what it could be if it was working exclusively using RingCT.</p><h3 id=\"what-are-public-balances-used-for\">What are Public Balances Used for?</h3><p>At this time, here’s a list of some components of the Particl ecosystem that require public balances to function:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Particl Proof-of-Stake (PPoS)</strong> consensus mechanism, including cold staking and cold staking pools. There is, however, an option to receive all staking rewards using RingCT or CT transactions for those looking for that extra layer of privacy. To learn more about how to do this, please refer to <a href=\"https://particl.news/private-cold-staking-script-released-d8900e193490/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>this article</strong></a>.</li><li>Particl's <strong>decentralized treasury</strong> which funds community initiatives.</li><li>The <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>community governance system</strong></a> which allows stakeholders to vote on important decisions with their stake weight.</li><li>The <strong>Particl Marketplace</strong> <strong>community moderation system</strong> which lets the users moderate undesirable content off of the marketplace and fight off spam on the platform.</li><li>The <strong>mobile wallet Particl Copay</strong>.</li><li>The <strong>light wallet Particl Electrum</strong> (desktop and mobile) which is expected to power future mobile and web releases.</li><li><strong>Hardware devices</strong> such as the Ledger Nano S and the Trezor.</li></ul><p>And, although Particl Marketplace’s <a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_escrow.html\">two-party escrow system</a> doesn’t rely on public transactions, it still requires CT transactions to link RingCT outputs together to provide its anonymity. You can read more on how this is done by checking out <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>this article</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>As you can see, many critical components of the Particl ecosystem entirely rely on public balances and transactions. Making PART private-by-default or outright mandating private transactions would cause a significant setback and even force the project to abandon some of its core components. This would go in direct opposition of our mission.</p><h3 id=\"what-about-exchanges\">What About Exchanges?</h3><p>Another downside associated with having a private-by-default cryptocurrency has to do with the ever-evolving legal landscape of the blockchain industry. As is becoming more evident by the day, regulations are tightening, notably around the use of “privacy coins”. As a result, a lot of leading exchanges have resorted to delisting and/or not entertaining adding privacy coins as a way to protect themselves and ensure that they remain compliant.</p><p>With Particl’s relatively precarious presence on exchanges, having the main transaction type be transparent is a definite upside.</p><p>And even though exchanges could, in theory, change the type of transactions they accept if Particl were to switch to a private-by-default model, they may not be inclined to do so purely based on the fact that PART itself has relatively low liquidity and volume. The effort involved with implementing that change at the exchange level, coupled with the legal uncertainty of accepting privacy coins, may simply not be worth it for exchanges. This could lead to a delisting and reduction of accessibility to the PART coin; something that cannot be neglected as the coin needs to be as accessible as possible for Particl to accomplish its mission.</p><h3 id=\"auditing-the-circulating-supply\">Auditing the Circulating Supply</h3><p>Everything in life has trade-offs. With cryptocurrencies that mandate private transactions like Monero, the added privacy is counter-balanced by the fact that the circulating supply cannot be properly audited with full certainty. And although the reasons that may cause supply inflation are usually considered more theoretical than practical, they are real risks nonetheless.</p><p>By having public balances on which people hold funds and stake from, you can determine, with more accuracy, whether or not the total number of coins in circulation is as expected. As the Monero team best wrote it: <em>“(…) the use of transparent fund migration means that an attempt to move enough exploited funds through the transparent Zcash pool could be detected (…)”</em>. On that note, we highly recommend reading <a href=\"https://www.getmonero.org/2020/01/17/auditability.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"><strong>Monero’s well-thought-out response on the topic of supply auditability</strong></a>, how it relates to private (“opaque”) cryptocurrencies, and the trade-offs involved with this.</p><p>In our particular case, supply auditability isn’t the main reason why we’ve opted against mandating private transactions, but it’s certainly an appreciable benefit.</p><h3 id=\"transaction-speed\">Transaction Speed</h3><p>One non-negligible benefit of having public balances is the faster speed of transaction settlements on Particl. While both public and anon transactions use block confirmation times of 2 minutes, public balances are usable after 1 confirmation (~2 minutes) while anon balances can only be used once the funds it contains have reached 12 confirmations (~24 minutes).</p><p>This speed is handy in many situations and straight up required in others, notably in the context of certain Particl applications where the public balance holds a key role (i.e., moderating marketplace content).</p><hr><h2 id=\"about-part-s-privacy\">About PART’s Privacy</h2><p>Although PART is a multi-purpose coin that accomplishes different functions within the ecosystem—and, as we’ve just seen, some of these functions cannot work over anon (RingCT) transactions—its privacy is still one of its most important selling points and development priorities. </p><p>When debating whether or not PART should be private-by-default, are we asking the right question? Is the entire debate misdirected?</p><p>At its most fundamental level, this debate seeks to find out whether or not PART’s current privacy capabilities are good enough to keep people anonymous. Whether or not PART mandates RingCT transactions or not is irrelevant as long as the user privacy is solid enough. </p><h3 id=\"is-particl-private-by-default\">Is Particl private-by-default?</h3><p>Let’s first clear this question out of the way. No, Particl isn’t “private-by-default”, but it is heavily focused on anonymity nonetheless.</p><p>Keep in mind, <strong>Particl’s mission is first and foremost to provide an ecosystem of applications that respect your rights.</strong> The race to the top for the absolute most private cryptocurrency in the space is not our primary focus and purpose. That being said, PART absolutely qualifies for a spot within the top privacy coins as we are just about to find out.</p><p>Keeping our mission in mind, PART is not dedicated exclusively to privacy maximalists but also to a much wider range of audiences that also include people that may not care as much about this specific aspect but more about others, like cutting off the middleman from their e-commerce operations, for example.</p><p>But is opt-in privacy, rather than mandated, an actual threat to the quality of that privacy? Let’s see how RingCT works in the first place so that we may be able to answer that question after.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-ringct-work\">How Does RingCT Work?</h2><p><a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf\">RingCT</a> is a combination of the <a href=\"https://blockstream.com/bitcoin17-final41.pdf\">Confidential Transactions (CT)</a> and Ring Signature privacy protocols. CT keeps transacting amounts private and ring signatures keep the identity of the participants private.</p><p>Whenever you make an anon transaction, the transacting anon outputs are pooled up with other anon outputs on the network (ring signatures). These other outputs pose as \"fake transaction participants\" and merely serve the role of being plausibly deniable decoys to hide amongst.</p><p>For an outside party looking into the transaction, it is theoretically not possible to tell, with certainty, which of the “participants” actually participated in the transaction, meaning that neither the value of the amount transferred nor its participants can be traced. And while academic and theoretical attack vectors do exist, as in every privacy protocol, RingCT has proven time and time again to be one of the most robust out there.</p><h3 id=\"what-contributes-to-greater-privacy\">What Contributes to Greater Privacy?</h3><p>To keep things simple, more anon transactions on the network mean more privacy, and that privacy gets even better when there’s a constant flow of new legitimate transactions being created. But let's break that down in more detail.</p><p>How private a transaction is, at the protocol level, mainly depends on two factors. On one end, the sender of an anon transaction can increase or decrease the level of its privacy by using a greater or lesser number of \"ring signatures\". More ring signatures means more decoys participating in a transaction and thus, in simple terms, greater expected privacy.</p><p>On the other end, the total number and diversity of these decoys matter greatly. Because RingCT's privacy is obtained by hiding among decoys, its effectiveness increases when there are more of them, and more of them coming from different sources, to pick from.</p><p>To understand this better, imagine that you are the sender of an anon transaction that contains 8 ring signatures. Out of these, 2 of them are real participants (the sender and the receiver) and 6 of them are decoys. If the identity of 4 of these decoys is known to an outside observer (i.e, an exchange, a blockchain tracing company, etc), that really only leaves you with 2 decoys to hide among, making it easier, in theory, for the real participants to be identified. </p><p>That's why having a large number of outputs and transactions on the network improves your privacy. It gives the protocol more decoys to work with, and more diverse ones, effectively reducing your chances of picking up compromised ones.</p><p>On the topic of the diversity in the source of these outputs, it is also very important as it reduces the chances of picking up decoys known to third-parties collecting data on large numbers of outputs from a single source (i.e., an exchange keeping tabs on all the Monero outputs of its users). Note that this becomes a much bigger problem if and when these parties start collaborating together and sharing their collected data with each other.</p><h3 id=\"opt-in-privacy-and-the-human-factor\">Opt-in Privacy and the Human Factor</h3><p>At the protocol level, RingCT's privacy isn't directly affected by whether or not it is mandated or the default transaction type of the blockchain.</p><p>If, for example, Particl’s RingCT layer had a similar number of transactions per day as Monero, it would have a somewhat comparable level of privacy <strong>at the protocol level</strong>. But, in practice, it gets a bit more complicated because, as mentioned earlier in this article, everything has trade-offs.</p><p>In the case of opt-in privacy, the trade-off is the human factor. Having the ability to switch back and forth between public and anon balances opens the door to human errors and sub-optimal protocol usage. As with all cryptocurrencies, including private-by-default assets like Monero, there are some considerations and best practices to keep in mind to maintain a good level of privacy. </p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> The risks typically associated with the human factor are mostly applicable to normal peer-to-peer anon transactions between two users. Using Particl applications, like the marketplace, significantly reduces the risk of human error by automatically applying some of the recommended best practices.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"leveraging-particl-applications-to-boost-privacy\">Leveraging Particl Applications to Boost Privacy</h2><p>As previously mentioned, the Particl project is much, much more than just a cryptocurrency. It's an ecosystem of distributed apps that respect your rights, with one of these rights being the right to privacy. And that's precisely where lies Particl's mind-blowing privacy potential; in its apps!</p><p>To understand why that is, let’s take the Particl Marketplace app as an example once again. It lets you buy and sell anything online with no restriction. It is private by default, meaning that all payments for goods and services have to use RingCT. For sellers, there's the option to pay for their listing fees (listing an item for sale on the marketplace) using anon transactions. </p><p>And thus, each item listed on the marketplace generates at least one transaction, meaning that a seller who wants to list 100 items will generate 100 unique anon transactions alone plus two other anon transactions per sale (as both the buyer and the seller have to make an anon transaction to complete the escrow private smart-contract).</p><p>As is self-evident, simple usage of the Particl apps like the marketplace dramatically scales the number of real, \"high-quality\" anon transactions per day on the network up. To get an idea, simply think of how many e-commerce transactions happen every day on the web. How many items are listed online. Sure, that's an unfairly large segment to compare Particl to, but just think of how many transactions happen just within the still-very-niche decentralized marketplace segment (i.e., OpenSea). </p><blockquote><em>\"To hide the signal, you must generate noise\"</em> - Kewde, Particl developer</blockquote><p>As a reference, Monero does around a solid 16,000 transactions per day at the time of writing this piece. Could usage of Particl Marketplace generate similar numbers? The jury is still out but one can speculate.</p><p>And the cherry on top? Particl Marketplace, and all future Particl applications like the upcoming BasicSwap DEX, is entirely decentralized and trustless. There's no central party able to collect any data about you, your anon outputs, or those of other participants on the network; a very unique advantage of Particl over other privacy coins.</p><p>In other words, using Particl applications not only increases the number of anon transactions and outputs on the network, but it also does so in a way that improves the quality and effectiveness of available decoys. As current and future Particl applications gain more adoption, so does the the level of on-chain privacy as well.</p><h2 id=\"new-privacy-boons-abound\">New Privacy Boons Abound</h2><p>Particl is fortunate to be built on the Bitcoin codebase. Indeed, contrary to what many think, the Bitcoin codebase is evolving rapidly and is going through a particularly innovative phase. That is especially true of recent progress made on the Lightning Network and Taproot, both of which innovations are available on Particl and enhanced by an extra RingCT bridge for added anonymity.</p><p>Not mandating RingCT transactions gives us the ability to leverage and combine these breakthrough developments from the Bitcoin community to massively improve Particl's privacy and make its applications better for all. </p><p><strong>Complex and Private LN-based Smart-Contracts</strong><br>Indeed, recent developments have made it possible to run complex smart-contracts on the Lightning Network. These smart-contracts can even be deployed using CT to keep the amounts transferred confidential. This is a significant development for the Bitcoin community as it dramatically improves your privacy and opens the coin up to even more use-cases. But there is a small caveat; blinded smart-contracts don't hide the identities of people using them; only the transacted amounts remain confidential.</p><p>If that smart-contract was powering the escrow of some hypothetical marketplace, it could be possible to tell the identity of the seller and the buyer of a given transaction. On Particl, the additional layer of RingCT would keep both the buyer and the seller private by letting them enter and exit the Lightning Network without leaving a trace. </p><p><strong>Taproot Scripts</strong><br>With Taproot now being enabled on Particl, new on-chain scripting options have become available. Taproot enables more advanced, but also more private, complex transactions by combining multiple keys and signatures into one. With it, you can pre-emptively program payments within a group of people and trigger them following a set of pre-defined conditions. The resulting transactions look just like any other regular transaction on the blockchain and neither the conditions nor the identities of the participants are exposed.  </p><p>This opens a ton of opportunities, like for example <a href=\"https://learningblocks.io/taproot-and-the-lightning-network-a-match-made-in-heaven/\">entering and exiting the Lightning Network more privately</a>, making Particl's treasury entirely decentralized, making BasicSwap DEX swaps with Bitcoin-based currencies look just like a normal transaction, or even <a href=\"https://youtu.be/gF4Mkkhyz1Q?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61KHzhg3JIJdK08JLSlcLId&#x26;t=4291\">making some core components of Particl quantum-proof</a>. And that's just to name a few of the possibilites... </p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> In both the cases of LN and Taproot, it's important to note that RingCT transactions are not directly merged with LN and taproot, but rather run upon entering and exiting the L2 network to break the history.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"so-should-part-become-private-by-default\">So, Should PART Become Private-by-Default?</h2><p>Ultimately, there is no right or wrong answer to this debate. With both options, there are pros, cons, and trade-offs. There is no perfect solution; it all depends on the purpose of a specific cryptocurrency and the mission it’s trying to accomplish. However, we are highly confident that Particl's current privacy setup strikes the optimal utility/privacy balance for what it seeks to accomplish and for who it seeks to accomplish it for. </p><p>And although PART can be said to be less private than competing privacy coins such as Monero, an obvious statement considering the difference in the number of transactions between the two networks <strong>at this present time</strong>, its privacy potential is just as solid, if not even better, assuming decent usage of Particl's distributed applications and that best practices are followed by users.</p><p>PART's public addresses provide a lot of capabilities that are key to Particl's ecosystem and they cannot be readily dismissed. For this reason, and for the other reasons mentioned earlier in the blog post, <strong>the Particl team does not plan to switch to an exclusively private-by-default model of transactional privacy in the foreseeable future</strong>. We want to reiterate our strong confidence in our current model and are focusing on building applications that will organically raise the diversity and number of anon transactions and outputs on the network.</p><p>That being said, we remain open to adjusting our position on this matter in the future depending on how things evolve.</p><h2 id=\"particl-desktop-privacy-improvements-on-the-way-\">Particl Desktop Privacy Improvements on the Way!</h2><p>The fact that we embrace an opt-in privacy setup doesn't mean we can't work towards reducing potential mistakes caused by the human factor. </p><p>As such, Particl Core contains a few improvements in the RingCT implementation that mitigate some of the risks introduced by the opt-in nature of PART's privacy setup. </p><p>Also, <strong>in the next few Particl Desktop updates</strong>, you can expect new privacy-focused UI additions and improvements that seek to reduce the risk of human errors to a minimum. For example, a simple \"churning function\" that automatically churns your anon outputs (generates privacy-enhancing transactions (send-to-self) and creates more noise to hide within) to improve your privacy and everyone else's as well. Stay tuned to our <a href=\"https://particl.news/tag/progress/\"><strong>weekly development updates</strong></a> for more information.</p><hr><h2 id=\"synergy-and-collaboration-not-tribalism-and-exclusion\">Synergy and Collaboration, not Tribalism and Exclusion</h2><p>Particl's purpose is to build an ecosystem of apps that respect your rights and is as inclusive as possible. The race to the top for the most private features on a cryptocurrency is something we keep in mind without prime focus, although we fully believe PART can eventually become as such once the adoption of the Particl platform grows.</p><p>As part of this vision, we are working on a cross-chain and private decentralized trading exchange (BasicSwap DEX) that lets you swap different cryptocurrencies without the use of any third-party.</p><p>That means you can easily enter and exit the Particl ecosystem using your favorite privacy coin such as Monero, for example, and enjoy the benefits of both chains at the same time. </p><p>By combining Monero's private-by-default currency-focused approach and Particl's app-focused vision, you can reach strong levels of privacy few people thought were possible. The trade-offs of using an opt-in privacy coin (Particl) can then be offset by using an opt-out one (Monero) on the platform, just like Monero can offset its trade-offs (lack of distributed apps and more rigidity) by bridging into the Particl ecosystem using BasicSwap. A win-win situation for both blockchains and a major victory for the people.</p><p>Once the DEX is integrated into Particl desktop client, Particl Desktop, the synergy it creates with other privacy coins will take the entire privacy enthusiast community to the next level. You'll be able to use distributed and private applications without making any security or privacy compromise and by using your favorite coin.</p><p>Indeed, synergy, not tribalism, is how we see the privacy coin space evolving to the direct benefit of the people. There are many different approaches to privacy and it’s difficult to say which one is the best because, in part, use-cases and target audiences differ so much. And so, why not combine different options and work in unison towards bringing more privacy to the average joe? That's what we set out to do with Particl, and what we'll keep giving our blood, sweat, and tears to day after day!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr>\n<h3 id=\"join-the-discussion\">Join the discussion</h3>\n<p>What's your stance?

The source\ncode linked to here is not the actual tagged release source code. Please\ncontact\nParticl for source code information. The actual source code will be uploaded\n...\nGitHubparticl [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.1.1]If\nyou happen to be a newcomer to Particl at all we highly recommend the Particl\nAcademy as your guide and reference book for getting along with Particl\nMarketplace.\n\nOpen Particl Academy [https://academy.particl.io]\n\nNotes\n * Your wallet needs to be unlocked to process buy and sell orders on the\n   marketplace.\n * If you spot any issue, bug, or area of improvement, please report it directly\n   on the Github Issues [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] \n   page.\n * The source code linked to here is not the actual tagged release source code.\n   Please contact the Particl team for source code information. The actual\n   source code will be uploaded and made available after an appropriate interval\n   of time has passed.\n\nAdvanced Start-up\nSometimes, it's helpful to start the application from the terminal, aka command\nline. It gives you additional information about what's happening in the\nbackground and can be useful for troubleshooting issues (if issues you\nencounter).\n\nWindows\n 1. Open \"Windows Explorer\"\n 2. On the installation folder (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\Particl Desktop\\Particl\n    Desktop\") Press [SHIFT⇧]+[MOUSE-RIGHT◳] and choose \"Open command window\n    here\"\n 3. Type the following command including the quotation marks into the terminal\n    and hit [ENTER ↵] \"Particl Desktop.exe\"\n\nMac\n 1. Open \"Terminal\" \n    (e.g. [COMMAND ⌘] + [SPACE] and type terminal > hit [ENTER ↵])\n 2. Type in this command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    /Applications/Particl\\ Desktop.app/Contents/MacOS/Particl\\ Desktop\n\nLinux\n 1. Open a terminal in the folder where you’ve installed the application and\n    type the following command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    ./Particl\\ Desktop\n\nList of Changes\nGeneral\n * The window title now correctly reflects the chain that the application is\n   started with, so as to more readily distinguish between running the\n   application on testnet or mainnet.\n\nMarketplace App\nIncluded here are the changes applied to both the UI of the marketplace, as well\nas the market service, for convenience:\n\n * Fixes an edge case when an order request might fail to be made despite\n   sufficient funds (and utxos) being available.\n * Fixes an order request not being able to be progressed by either buyer or\n   seller after being made, if the seller escrow amount required is 0.\n * Ignores received listing messages if the listing in the message has expired\n   by the time the listing message is processed. This means that the processing\n   of actual, valid listing messages are processed a lot sooner rather than\n   spending time processing messages that are not going to be useful to begin\n   with (i.e., faster time to see messages when joining a market), as well as\n   preventing the unnecessary updating of the \"pending new items\" refresh button\n   count with expired listings.\n * Adjusts the checking of available utxos when publishing listings to a market.\n   This should provide some measure of preventing cases where listings are\n   published without their associated images.\n * Prevents an order status from incorrectly being updated if the buyer attempts\n   to cancel an order in the \"escrow locked\" status but the seller has already\n   completed the escrow transaction and the buyer node simply has not received\n   the updated status message). Previously, the order status was incorrectly\n   updated to the \"cancelled\" status despite the cancellation request failing;\n   the status is now untouched if the cancellation fails.\n * Fixes listing and market images not being correctly removed from the\n   filesystem.\n * Removes the current listings associated with a market as well when a market\n   is un-joined, rather than leaving the listings and waiting for the listing to\n   expire before removing it.\n * Combines the market ID and applicable market key into a single value: rather\n   than needing to copy out 2 values for sharing access to a market, only one\n   value is now needed. The same applies for the market joining: only a single\n   value is needed to be entered, rather than 2 separate values.\n * Removes the 'Edit Product' button and instead places it inside of a separate\n   \"product info\" modal: this is to more clearly distinguish between editing of\n   a product template and a market-specific template (which tends to cause\n   confusion when a market template requires editing but the product template\n   edit action is more visible and tended to be used more readily instead).\n * Changes the displayed graphic and accompanying text when browsing a market\n   with no listings: a different graphic (and text) is now displayed when the\n   blockchain is still syncing, to clearly distinguish why there may be no\n   listings currently available.\n * Re-sends the escrow complete message in addition to the shipping message when\n   a seller re-sends the order status at the shipping step. If the buyer side\n   was missing the escrow complete status message then re-sending the shipping\n   status alone is insufficient to update the buyer status, so both the escrow\n   complete and shipping status messages are resent at the shipping status step.\n * Updates the error to more accurately reflect the reason for failing to\n   publish a listing when the listing itself is successfully published, but one\n   or more images in the listing are not correctly published.\n * Fixes the display of an order item's shipping value to correctly display the\n   actual shipping value used.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs Particl Desktop 3.1.1 fixes various bugs and issues that were encoutered by\nlive users, we invite those users to give this new update a spin and report back\nif any issue still persists (which shouldn't be the case).\n\nWe thank you all in the community for testing Particl Desktop and the\nmarketplace extensively and reporting back.

anonymity in\ncryptocurrencies and decentralized systems, we share our thoughts on the purpose\nof privacy in decentralized eCommerce platforms, specifically with regards to\nprotecting user safety and data sovereignty.\n\nA Brief Reminder of Bitcoin’s History\nNearly two decades ago, Bitcoin was introduced as a digital currency aiming to\nprovide financial freedom and personal sovereignty globally, irrespective of\none's background or circumstances.\n\nAnd while it spawned an incredible revolution, both in technological progress\nand online discourse, the proposed solution unfortunately fell short of\naccomplishing its stated mission.\n\nAn Unfortunate Reality\nContrary to early assumptions, Bitcoin transactions are far from private. In\nfact, they often fare worse than traditional fiat currencies in preserving\nfinancial confidentiality. Indeed, fiat systems typically handle fund transfers\nthrough secured channels designed to safeguard users' financial data from\nunauthorized public exposure.\n\nIn stark contrast, all Bitcoin transactions are permanently recorded on a public\nledger, openly exposing the entirety of one's financial details to any curious\nobserver. While Bitcoin's pseudonymous nature may foster a sense of anonymity in\nlimited contexts, this perception is increasingly recognized as a dangerous\nillusion.\n\nIn fact, transaction tracing capabilities have advanced significantly in the\npast few years, driven in part by regulatory requirements like\nKnow-Your-Customer (KYC) compliance that have necessitated increased transaction\nmonitoring by financial services.\n\nHistorically, only regulatory bodies and financial institutions had access to\ndetailed reports of users' on-chain financial histories through partnerships\nwith blockchain analytics firms however, the ability to effectively deanonymize\ntransactions and map them to real-world identities is rapidly proliferating to\nnew actors — most concerningly, criminals, hackers, and other malicious entities\nintent on exploiting this data for financial gain at the expense of unsuspecting\nvictims — thanks to the rapid evolution of large language models and artificial\nintelligence that have spawned widely accessible tracing protocols.\n\nThese escalating privacy vulnerabilities underscore the paramount importance of\ndeveloping robust privacy-preserving solutions for cryptocurrencies across the\nglobe, such as, among others, ”privacy coins”. Maintaining financial\nconfidentiality is not merely a luxury but an essential capability to safeguard\nusers operating in these systems.\n\nBitcoin and eCommerce\nHowever, when it comes to decentralized commerce – the logical evolution beyond\ndecentralized currencies – merely utilizing privacy coins is not sufficient.\nWhile on-chain transactions may be inherently private, the platforms\nfacilitating purchases and sales represent another significant attack vector\nthat must be addressed.\n\nAs regulatory obligations evolve, businesses operating centralized\ncryptocurrency platforms may be compelled to collect extensive user information,\nincluding transaction histories, associated identities, IP addresses, shipping\ndetails from buyers, sales data from sellers, and more. While one could\nreasonably expect regulatory bodies to handle such information responsibly, the\nsame assurances cannot be extended to the platforms themselves, as highlighted\nin our previous articles on the imperatives of privacy here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/] \nand here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-the-need-to-own-your-data-19bc31b0ec74/]\n.\n\nBut even if all platforms always acted in good faith, this centralized\naggregation of sensitive data becomes an enticing target for hackers and other\nmalicious actors seeking to exploit personal and financial information for\nillicit gains.\n\nThe Inherent Safety Risks of DeCommerce\nThe logical solution, therefore, is to develop an eCommerce platform that is as\ndecentralized as cryptocurrencies themselves. Such a platform would operate in a\npurely peer-to-peer manner, built upon a truly decentralized architecture devoid\nof single points of failure or centralized components. The objective is to offer\nservices akin to centralized eCommerce giants like eBay or Amazon, but without\nany central entity, thus eliminating the associated costs, fees, and frictions\ninherent to intermediaries. A \"decentralized online marketplace\", embodying\nBitcoin's ethos, and providing a clear user experience improvement over\ncentralized counterparts without data collection.\n\nHowever, while recent advancements in blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies\nenable such decentralized eCommerce platforms, they also introduce new\nchallenges in preserving users' financial data privacy and safety.\n\nPicture this scenario: You open a decentralized marketplace, hoping to purchase\na new computer online. You browse available listings from sellers worldwide and\nfind a suitable item. You proceed to add it to your cart and checkout, providing\nthe seller with your shipping address. Herein lies a significant safety concern;\nif you've paid using pseudonymous cryptocurrencies, you've likely revealed your\nphysical location alongside your entire financial history, including balances\nand past transactions.\n\nIn most cases, such disclosures may be innocuous, however, over an extended\nperiod, you or someone else may inadvertently expose critical details to\nmalicious actors, which could be used to identify and target the potential\nvictim. This risk vector is particularly concerning for high net-worth\nindividuals, as every purchase they make could effectively paint a target on\ntheir backs, making this situation simply unsustainable.\n\nCentralized platforms like eBay or Amazon typically circumvent this issue, as\npayments are facilitated through highly regulated centralized providers like\nPayPal, among others. While these entities face valid criticisms, they at least\navoid exposing users' complete financial histories on pseudonymous ledgers.\n\nHowever, a decentralized platform, by its very nature, does not rely on payment\nprocessors. Instead, it enables direct peer-to-peer trade between buyers and\nsellers. Consequently, an alternative solution must be implemented to preserve\nusers' financial privacy and security.\n\nThe Need for Privacy in DeCommerce\nParticl Marketplace addresses these concerns with its decentralized and secure\nonline marketplace, often touted as a privacy-first eCommerce solution. It\nensures user safety by providing robust privacy safeguards in two critical\nareas.\n\nTransactional Privacy\nFirst, it facilitates complete transactional privacy for counterparties through\nthe use of PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, which integrates advanced\non-chain privacy protocols. Two specific protocols are instrumental in\npreserving financial confidentiality: Confidential Transactions (\"CT\") and ring\nsignatures (\"RingCT\").\n\nCT transactions conceal the transfer amounts between parties, while RingCT\nobfuscates both transaction amounts and participant identities. However, RingCT\ntransactions lack programmable outputs, rendering them incompatible with\ndecentralized applications like Particl Marketplace. To address this limitation,\nRingCT inputs can be mapped to CT outputs, which possess programmable\ncapabilities. By chaining these protocols, Particl Marketplace effectively\nharnesses RingCT's enhanced privacy while facilitating seamless integration,\nproviding users with safety — which is otherwise entirely absent without\ntransactional privacy — and the assurance that their financial data remains\nconfidential during transactions.\n\nData-free Marketplace Activity\nSecondly, Particl Marketplace addresses the concerns surrounding excessive data\ncollection practices by centralized eCommerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, and\nEtsy, which have faced criticism for undermining user privacy. Some platforms\nhave even exploited user data to directly compete with their own sellers, as\nexemplified by AmazonBasics products and other Amazon sub-brands – an issue we\nhave previously explored in depth here\n[https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/].\n\nMoreover, while platforms claim to harvest data to enhance user experiences,\ntracking shopping habits can inadvertently expose sensitive information without\nconsent. A notable example is the Target pregnancy prediction case, in which an\nunsuspecting father learned of his daughter's pregnancy due to ad targeting – a\nscenario we’ve also previously discussed here\n[https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/].\n\nTo safeguard against such privacy infringements and data misuse, Particl\nMarketplace is designed to eliminate data generation, collection, storage, or\ndistribution entirely – encompassing both financial and non-financial metadata.\nAll marketplace activity data is stored locally, and all data transmitted (such\nas buyer-seller communications or shipping details) is conveyed through\nend-to-end encrypted messages via SMSG, a peer-to-peer data and messaging\nplatform (\"mixnet\") operating alongside Particl Core nodes\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/].\n\nThis privacy-first architecture ensures user safety and guarantees complete data\nownership and control, while preventing malicious data extraction through hacks,\nexploits, or the simple act of buying or selling online.\n\nConclusion\nWhile various accessibility, usability, and user-experience improvements are\nstill needed, the end result is a decentralized online marketplace that\neliminates fees and associated frictions inherent to third-party intermediaries\nwithin the eCommerce domain.\n\nHowever, beyond these benefits, it primarily serves as a secure platform for\ncryptocurrency users to engage in direct peer-to-peer trade without compromising\ntheir safety by exposing financial information to potentially malicious\nstrangers.\n\nAs we have aimed to clarify with this blog post, privacy in the context of\ncryptocurrency usage transcends a luxury or edge case. In scenarios such as\neCommerce/deCommerce, it is an absolute necessity to ensure the safety and\nwell-being of users transacting with unknown counterparties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

for seamless and\npractical decentralized commerce solutions remains a driving force. Although\nthis is a self-evident use case for crypto, comprehensive solutions to use\ndecentralized money as money, without relying on heavily centralized\narchitecture, is lacking.\n\nWhile achieving this goal has proven challenging, this article explores how\nintegrating BasicSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) that offers Litecoin\npairs, into Particl Marketplace, a decentralized e-commerce platform, offers a\nsolution to overcome many user experience obstacles that have come to hinder the\nevolution of cryptocurrencies as a medium of payment.\n\nBy providing multi-currency support\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-integration-unlocking-currency-agnostic-commerce-on-particl/] \nto the decentralized e-commerce ecosystem, this upcoming integration offers a\ntangible path forward for many coins, unlocking the potential for widespread\ncryptocurrency usage in everyday retail transactions.\n\nWith this in mind, Litecoin, with its focused push as a payment currency, serves\nas the perfect candidate to illustrate this transformative potential, allowing\nanyone to use Litecoin for shopping.\n\nLitecoin; Faster and Cheaper Transactions\nLitecoin has garnered significant attention for its faster transaction times and\nlower fees compared to Bitcoin – a stark contrast to the latter's reputation for\nsluggish and costly processing. This, from the beginning, has positioned\nLitecoin as an ideal cryptocurrency for payments and commerce. Recognizing its\nstrengths in speed and affordability, the Litecoin community has been actively\npromoting its adoption as a practical and viable payment solution for years now.\n\nLitecoin MWEB and Privacy: Solidifying Litecoin as True Digital Cash\nLitecoin's MWEB (MimbleWimble Extension Blocks) introduces a significant\nimprovement to an already payment-friendly digital currency: transactional\nprivacy. This brings confidential transactions and privacy features to the\nLitecoin network, a pivotal development poised to solidify its positioning as\ntrue digital cash and a viable currency for payments.\n\nPrivacy is, of course, a crucial aspect in the realm of digital payments, as it\nsafeguards users' and businesses' financial information and promotes fungibility\n– a fundamental characteristic of sound money.\n\nParticl Marketplace: Redefining Decentralized E-Commerce\nWhile transactional privacy is paramount, it is also crucial for the platform\nfacilitating such payments to uphold privacy as well.\n\nEnvision this scenario: you send a private payment using Litecoin MWEB or even\nMonero to purchase an item online. However, you later discover that this\nplatform has been collecting user data and subsequently fell victim to a data\nbreach, exposing your shipping information, shopping history, along with\naddresses and payment details to an attacker. An absolute nightmare, even if the\ninitial payment was conducted through a private transaction.\n\nThis underscores the fact that private payments alone are insufficient to\ncompletely safeguard your shopping habits and selling history. This fact stands\nas a premise for the design of Particl Marketplace.\n\nParticl Marketplace is a decentralized, privacy-focused e-commerce platform\nbuilt using blockchain and peer-to-peer technology. Unlike traditional\ne-commerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, Etsy, or Alibaba, Particl Marketplace\noperates without intermediaries, ensuring secure and private transactions\nbetween users, free from fees or restrictions. Buyers and sellers transact\ndirectly, benefiting from a two-party escrow system that protects both parties\nand keeps all trade information private to the involved parties only.\n\nUsing Litecoin for Shopping on Particl Marketplace Soon to be AvailableWhile the\nplatform's unapologetically decentralized nature and privacy features make it an\nattractive alternative to centralized e-commerce platforms (which often face\ncensorship, data breaches, and other vulnerabilities), it is currently limited\nto using PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, as the settlement currency. This\nis due to PART’s unique technology being an integral component in enabling some\nof the marketplace's unique features in the first place.\n\nBasicSwap DEX: Enabling Multi-Currency Payments\nLitecoin MWEB Balances and Conversions Live on BasicSwap DEXLitecoin\nMimbleWimble balances and balance conversions are now live on BasicSwap DEX, a\nfirst step towards full MWEB swaps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/litecoin-mweb-balances-and-conversions-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\nBasicSwap DEX is a decentralized exchange protocol and platform powered by\natomic swaps and SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a distributed data and\nmessaging protocol (often referred to as a “mixnet”). It offers a non-custodial\nand privacy-first trading experience, enabling trustless cross-chain swaps\nbetween different cryptocurrencies across various blockchains. And just like\nParticl Marketplace, it imposes no fees, restrictions, or data collection\npractices.\n\nAnd while it has always included Litecoin since its inception, it recently\nintegrated MWEB balances, paving the way for full MWEB swaps once Litecoin's\nupcoming core update — which will detect incoming Litecoin transactions using\nonly the viewkey without requiring the spendkey — goes live.\n\nTrade Litecoin on BasicSwap DEX (Litecoin DEX)By integrating BasicSwap into\nParticl Marketplace, alternative payment options are introduced at the time of\ncheckout, allowing users to seamlessly pay for items using their preferred\ncryptocurrency, a prime candidate of which being the fast and private Litecoin\nMWEB token.\n\nThis synergy aligns perfectly with Litecoin's vision of becoming a viable and\npractical form of digital cash, providing an additional real-world use case that\nfurther solidifies its position.\n\nBuilding Bridges Between Cryptocurrencies\nThe upcoming integration of BasicSwap and Litecoin MWEB on Particl Marketplace\nexemplifies BasicSwap's broader mission of forging bridges between diverse\ncryptocurrency communities and projects through its cross-chain functionality.\nThis synergy unites our efforts toward a shared vision of building a global\neconomy that prioritizes sovereignty and interoperability - the great promise of\ncrypto.\n\nBy enabling the use of Litecoin on Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap fosters a\nsymbiotic relationship that holds immense promise. Cultivating interoperability\nbetween the two ecosystems will accelerate the adoption of Litecoin as a\npractical, decentralized, and privacy-focused payment solution, while further\npositioning Particl as an enabler of financial activities beyond simple\npeer-to-peer transactions.\n\nIf you share this vision, we invite you to join the Particl and BasicSwap\ncommunity as we build towards a sovereign future and contribute to the mission,\nwhether through code or spreading awareness within the Litecoin community\nitself. As the economy is fundamentally a social phenomenon, every contribution,\nbig or small, propels us forward.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

This is the future\nof BasicSwap, the atomic swap-based decentralized exchange that promises to be a\ncornerstone of the Particl ecosystem, and a catalyst for the growth of\ndecentralized commerce.\n\nThe Particl Ecosystem: A Beacon of Privacy Against Fiat\nParticl, through a multitude of modular privacy apps, can be understood as an\necosystem designed to respect individuals’ rights, freedoms, and privacy without\ncompromise. \n\nAt the core of the Particl project is the Particl Marketplace, a decentralized\ne-commerce platform that allows buyers and sellers to transact directly without\nintermediaries. This platform is complemented by a suite of privacy-focused\nprotocols that enable users to conduct various activities without relying on\nthird-party service providers.\n\nHowever, as Particl seeks to establish itself as a truly independent and\nself-sustaining ecosystem, a glaring issue has been a lack of avenues for\ninteracting effectively with the Marketplace, and the accessibility shortcomings\nthis represents. \n\nUntil recently, users have had to rely on centralized exchanges or unprotected\nover-the-counter (OTC) deals to acquire PART, the native currency of Particl\nMarketplace settlements, which undermines the platform's core principles of\nprivacy and autonomy.\n\nBridging the Gap: Bringing Decentralized Commerce to All Crypto\nWhile BasicSwap currently functions as an open-source decentralized exchange\napplication designed to facilitate trustless and anonymous trading of digital\nassets for all, its essence transcends that of a mere application; it is\nprimarily a protocol. This distinction, though seemingly minor on the surface,\ncarries profound implications for the future usage and purpose of BasicSwap.\n\nBy integrating it with the Particl Marketplace, thus providing to it\nBasicSwap-powered swap services such as a multi-currency payment option during\ncheckout, it promises to bridge the gap between privacy and decentralized\ncommerce, enabling users to interact with the Particl Marketplace using their\npreferred currency, while seamlessly converting the payment into PART in order\nto interact with certain aspects of the marketplace itself, such as Particl’s\nunique two-party escrow system\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-marketplace/marketplace_escrow.html]\n. The end result is a smooth experience where customers can pay for items in\ntheir preferred currency, which is then converted into PART in the background,\nproviding value to both the end-user and the Particl community of holders.\n\nBenefits that Extend Beyond the Usefulness of Multi-Currency Payments\nOne of the key advantages of BasicSwap is its ability to leverage atomic swap\ntechnology, specifically adaptor signatures, to allow users to exchange\ndifferent cryptocurrencies privately and without the need for a centralized\nintermediary. This not only enhances user security, it also opens up new\npossibilities for inter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects\nand their unique benefits.\n\nImagine a scenario where you wish to purchase an item on the Particl Marketplace\nusing Firo, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that employs the Lelantus protocol\nfor anonymity. With BasicSwap, you can initiate the transaction by sending your\nFiro to a designated address provided by the DEX. \n\nThe coins are then \"burned,\" and the Firo redeem token is exchanged for\nanonymous PART using BasicSwap, which is then used to complete the purchase on\nthe Particl Marketplace. Of course, all of this would happen behind the scenes,\nthe end-user being left with an easy-to-follow and comprehensive user experience\nakin to choosing a “checkout option” on traditional marketplaces.\n\nThis simple act demonstrates the power of atomic swap technology, effectively\ncombining the unique benefits of whatever coin is used as the checkout payment\noption (Firo, Monero, Litecoin MWEB, etc) and RingCT (the privacy protocol used\nby PART) in a single transaction. \n\nBy enabling such inter-compatibility between privacy technologies, BasicSwap\nunlocks a world of possibilities for users seeking to maintain their financial\nprivacy while engaging in decentralized commerce.\n\nThe Implications of a Truly Decentralized and Agnostic Payment System\nWhile the focus of BasicSwap is on bridging privacy projects and privacy coins,\nits true potential extends far beyond this scope. By offering a truly\ndecentralized and agnostic payment system, the BasicSwap protocol opens the door\nto a wide range of use cases and possibilities.\n\nOne exciting prospect is the integration of stablecoins, which could provide a\nmore stable and predictable means of value transfer within the Particl\necosystem. This could be particularly beneficial for e-commerce transactions,\nwhere price volatility can be a concern when cryptocurrency is involved.\n\nMoreover, the potential for anonymous stablecoins, or of anonymous swaps of\nexisting stablecoins, raises intriguing possibilities for enhancing financial\nprivacy while maintaining the benefits of price stability. As the technology\nevolves, BasicSwap's agnostic nature positions it to seamlessly integrate and\nfacilitate the use of such innovative financial instruments within the Particl\nMarketplace and beyond.\n\nConclusion: A Cornerstone for Decentralized Commerce\nThe integration of BasicSwap with the Particl Marketplace represents a\nsignificant milestone in our journey towards financial sovereignty. By providing\na robust and decentralized platform for trading PART and facilitating\ninter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects, BasicSwap is\npoised to become a cornerstone of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nAs the world increasingly recognizes the importance of privacy and autonomy in\nfinancial transactions, platforms like Particl and BasicSwap are poised to lead\nthe way in fostering a truly decentralized and privacy-focused economic\nenvironment. \n\nWith its commitment to agnosticism and its ability to adapt to emerging\ntechnologies, BasicSwap has the potential to revolutionize the way we think\nabout decentralized commerce, paving the way for a future where individuals can\ntransact freely, securely, and without the need for trusted third parties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
