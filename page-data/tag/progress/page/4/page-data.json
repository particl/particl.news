Please follow the instructions provided here\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html] \nto update your BasicSwap to the latest version.\n\nWe're now ready to officially launch Litecoin MWEB balances, so stay tuned for\nan official announcement about it next week!\n\nUser Interface (GUI 2.1) ?️\nAhead of the Litecoin MWEB release, we've rolled out a minor update (currently\nunder the dev Github branch) to BasicSwap's GUI that improves the display of\ninformation on the order book and includes several refinements to the Wallets\npage. This update will hit the master branch shortly next week before\nBasicSwap's Litecoin MWEB release.\n\nWe're also preparing for more comprehensive updates to the GUI as part of the\nbroader version 2.1, which we expect to release shortly.\n\nMiscellaneous ✅\nWe've also made a series of improvements and bug fixes to the DEX.\n\n * Set min_relay_fee for Litecoin.\n * Failing reverse bids at checkQueuedActions now set to \"Error\".\n * Console page does not offer option for XMR / MWEB wallets anymore if they are\n   not enabled.\n * Propagate errors from checkQueuedActions (in progress).\n * Updated the dependencies and the install script.\n * Added delay to time delay settings.\n\nParticl and BasicSwap Media ?\nDr. Kap's Privacy Hour ⌚️\nThe second episode of Dr. Kap's Privacy Hour has been published on our YouTube\nchannel and you can watch it right here using the embedded player just below.\n\nDon't miss out on future episodes – they will be broadcast live on X Spaces and\nthen re-uploaded to our YouTube channel shortly thereafter.

While this integration is still in the testing phase and not yet\nready for a full production roll-out, it represents a major step forward and has\nbeen updated on BasicSwap's dev Github branch.\n\nOur next focus is addressing the management of change during the conversion from\nregular LTC to MWEB balances. Currently, the change from such conversions also\nbecomes MWEB but remains in the regular address instead of transitioning to\nMWEB. Resolving this will be one of our main goals in the coming week.\n\nNew Coin Core Updates ✅\nWe've recently rolled out updates for two coin cores: Firo and Litecoin. As\nalways, we strongly recommend that you keep your core nodes updated to the\nlatest versions, which is particularly important in this instance as both Firo\nand Litecoin have upcoming hardforks — Firo with the introduction of Lelantus,\nand Litecoin with the full integration of MWEB.\n\nFor guidance on how to update your coin cores, please refer to the step-by-step\ninstructions provided in the Particl Academy here\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html]\n.\n\nInstallation Wizard ?‍♂️\nWe've successfully completed testing BasicSwap's installation wizard version 2.0\nfor Windows last week and are now testing it for OSX. It is nearly ready to\npre-release it.\n\nAs a new addition, the updated installer now lets you update the DEX, and also\nincludes additional scripts to update its dependencies and launch the\napplication (not just install it) by double-clicking on an icon.\n\nUser Interface (GUI 2.1) ?️\nWe are making steady progress on finalizing version 2.1 of BasicSwap's user\ninterface, and need a few extra days to finish everything up. \n\nNote that, this week, we've incorporated changes to the user interface to\nsupport the new Litecoin balance types.

are observing a delay that is impacting the development\nprocess of Particl Desktop which we are working on resolving.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits ·

updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nInstallation Wizard ?‍♂️\nWe've successfully completed testing BasicSwap's installation wizard version 2.0\nthis week and are nearly ready to pre-release it. \n\nAs a new addition, the updated installer now lets you update the DEX, and also\nincludes additional scripts to update its dependencies and launch the\napplication (not just install it) by double-clicking on an icon.\n\nAPI Key Management ?\nBasicSwap DEX Update Guide — Particl Academy latest documentationLearn how to\nupdate your BasicSwap instance.\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html]\nThe recent surge in BasicSwap's usage led to an instance where our API key,\nresponsible for supplying data for the various coin charts to users, briefly hit\nits maximum request limit. To address this, we've made modifications to how the\ncharting system retrieves data from the API to prevent such occurrences in the\nfuture.\n\nTo apply the update to how API keys are managed on BasicSwap, you must update\nyour BasicSwap instance by following the tutorial here\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html]\n. \n\nWe're planning to implement further measures shortly to improve the robustness\nof the charting system even more.\n\n> NOTE: You can also input your own API key in the DEX's settings if you prefer to\nsource this data independently.\nUser Interface (GUI 2.1) ?️\nWe are making steady progress on finalizing version 2.1 of BasicSwap's user\ninterface, despite encountering some delays due to the need to fix a few issues\npicked up by the recent testing of the installation wizard and the necessary\nimprovements required to stabilize the charting API.\n\nOur goal remains to launch the 2.1 GUI update by Christmas. However, considering\nthe recent delays, there's a possibility that the release might be pushed to a\nfew days after.\n\nMiscellaneous ✅\n * Fixed Dash's download link for OSX\n * Updated Dash Core (users need to manually update, see \"Update Coin Core\n   Versions\" here\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html]\n   )\n * Added the --startonlycoin flag to the update command to only start the\n   provided coin daemon(s). To be used if a chain requires extra processing\n   during the update process (e.g., Firo, Dash)\n * Made running the local Monero daemon the default and recommended option in\n   the install.md\n * API keys can now only be specified in one single location to facilitate its\n   management across the app\n\nParticl and BasicSwap Media ?\nDon't Miss our Privacy Roundtable Tomorrow ? \nBasicSwap is excited to host a Privacy Roundtable with our friends from PIVX and\nZano tomorrow at 9 am EST. \n\nJoin us for this pre-Christmas gathering as we delve into the rise of AI and its\nimplications for our freedom and privacy.

This feature would work similarly to how users\ncurrently handle public, blind, and anon balances for Particl.\n\nImplementing this integration for Litecoin's MWEB would provide users with the\nability to convert their balances and perform deposits and withdrawals using\nMWEB transactions. However, it's important to note that Litecoin's upcoming\nmajor MWEB update is still required for full MWEB swaps to be possible.\n\nOur research and development efforts in this area will continue in the coming\nweeks alongside other projects, and we stand at the ready for a full MWEB\nimplementation once the update goes live in a few weeks/months.\n\nAutomated Market Making on a Cloud BSX Instance ☁️\nCloud Setup and Automated Market Making for BasicSwapSetup a BasicSwap cloud\ninstance and effortlessly run automated market making 24/7Particl News\ncryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/the-ultimate-cloud-basicswap-setup-and-automated-market-making/]\nTo help improve liquidity and overcome some of the challenges associated with\nrunning BasicSwap in its current form, we've published two video tutorials that\nshow you how to smoothly run the DEX on a cloud server and automate the process\nof providing liquidity on the DEX using BasicSwap's automated market making\nscript. \n\nCombining these features results in a powerful tool: a 24/7 BasicSwap cloud\ninstance that autonomously and dynamically manages your offers.

After\ninvestigating, we identified that the problem stemmed from a need to update the\ncoincurve dependency and worked on a new functionality that allows for updating\ndependencies directly through the installer. \n\nWe believe the update to this functionality is now complete. However, to ensure\neverything works smoothly, we plan to spend a bit more time testing the new\nversion of the installer over the weekend, with plans to release the update\nearly next week if all goes well. We are testing the fixes on MacOS as well.\n\nThanks to the community for testing and reporting issues and bugs, your help is\ninvaluable!\n\nUser Interface (GUI 2.1) ?️\nWe were in the process of wrapping up the next update of the user interface when\nwe had to shift our focus temporarily to address the installation wizard issue,\nas previously mentioned. \n\nDespite this pivot, we remain optimistic about our timeline; our goal still\nbeing to have the user interface update ready and released before Christmas.\n\nParticl and BasicSwap Media ?\nFrom today onwards, we'll start reporting some of our media and social media\nappearances we've had for the past week in this new section.

You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nWhile working on our current deliverables, we've made a series of improvements\nto the BasicSwap codebase.\n\n * Fix 'reverse' showing in UI for secret hash swaps.\n * Include txids and vouts in proof of funds when coins don't have scantxoutset\n   (e.g., Firo and future coins).\n\nFiro-related Fix ?\nWe've continued making progress on the integration of Firo into the installer.\nThe series of fixes have also led to a better, more neatly integration of the\nprivacy coin into the DEX. \n\nAt this time, we're still working on a few issues stemming from Firo's unique\ncodebase, which are leading us to streamline and standardize certain aspects of\nBasicSwap which will have the benefit improving forward-compatibility with\nfuture coins as well. While the integration with Firo is generally functional at\nthis stage,, we're working towards eliminating a few bugs, which shouldn't take\ntoo long anymore.\n\nOnce the fix is live, Firo will be seamlessly integrated into the current\ninstaller. No update of the installer itself will be required.\n\nIn detail:\n\n * Fixed Firo transaction serialisation errors.\n * Added the ability to do reverse adaptor signature swaps using Firo.\n * Added the ability to fetch new Firo binaries within the installer.\n * Will be able to use Firo's scantxoutset workaround for Navcoin.\n\nWeb Order Book Display ?\nWe are working on a web display of the current BasicSwap order book to be\ndisplayed on its website (BasicSwapDEX.com [https://BasicSwapDEX.com]). This\nfeature will let you view all available offers on the DEX's primary order book\ndirectly through the website, without the need to download and install the\nplatform. \n\nThis capability should encourage more people to set up and use the DEX,\nespecially if they identify attractive arbitrage opportunities, for example.\n\nInstallation Wizard ?\nWe have completed the few fixes and improvements to the BasicSwap installation\nwizard. While updating the installer isn't currently required to include Firo,\nwe're holding off on releasing the new version of the installer until the\ncomplete resolution for Firo is finalized in case that changes.\n\nAdditionally, we are finalizing work on the MacOS and Linux versions of the\ninstaller so that users on these operating systems can also enjoy the simplicity\nbrought by the installer. These should follow a few days after the release of\nthe new Windows installer, and will be on the same version.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nWe are still wrapping up the 2.1 GUI update, with a few additional issues picked\nup this week and currently being worked on. This deliverable is the current main\nfocus of our front-end developer and we're working towards releasing it ASAP.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

that has been made in\nthe past few days. Let us take a moment to evaluate the advancements achieved in\nthe past few days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?️\nWe're still completing the items outlined in our previous updates, namely\nincluding enhancing Tor server capabilities and making a variety of minor\nimprovements.\n\nPlease note, that we are observing a delay that is impacting the development\nprocess of Particl Desktop which we are working on resolving.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nFiro-related Fix ?\nThis week, we allocated time to develop a solution that would integrate Firo\ninto BasicSwap's installation wizard. We've made satisfactory progress, so much\nthat we believe to have a working fix at the moment, but will require a few more\ndays of testing to ensure no unexpected issue arises. As the main challenge\nstemmed from compatibility issues originating more from Firo's codebase than\nBasicSwap's, resolving the problem ended up being more intricate than one might\nanticipate. This task has thus occupied a significant part of our efforts this\nweek.\n\nOnce the fix is live, Firo will be seamlessly integrated into the current\ninstaller. No update of the installer itself will be required.\n\nWeb Order Book Display ?\nWe have continuing work on the development of a web display for BasicSwap's\ncurrent order book on BasicSwapDEX.com. This feature will let you view all\navailable offers on the DEX's primary order book directly through the website,\nwithout the need to download and install the platform. This capability should\nencourage more people to set up and use the DEX, especially if they identify\nattractive arbitrage opportunities, for example.\n\nInstallation Wizard ?\nWe are busy working on a few fixes and improvements to the BasicSwap\ninstallation wizard following community testing and feedback, including the\nfixes related to the addition of Firo. These changes will be included in\nupcoming versions of the installer for the available platforms.\n\nAdditionally, we are currently running tests for MacOS and Linux versions of the\ninstaller so that users on these operating systems can also enjoy the simplicity\nbrought by the installer.\n\nNote that, because most users that had issues installing and setting up\nBasicSwap DEX were on Windows, we opted to focus on providing an installer for\nthat platform first. That being said, be reassured that we are fully committed\nto releasing versions for other platforms as well and are presently working on\nit.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nWe've also made progress working on the user interface, picking up from where we\nleft off when we started mostly focusing on the installer. At this point, we\nfind ourselves in the wrap up phase of the 2.1 GUI update as we test the changes\nand ensure no bugs or unexpected behaviors are encountered.\n\nAs such, we do not expect new items to be added to the upcoming 2.1 release,\nother than what's already been mentioned in previous updates (see here\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-22-09-2023#user-interface-]\n), as we're satisfied with the current changelog and are eager to start working\non new, exciting development projects for both BasicSwap and Particl Marketplace\nwhich we'll announce and detail shortly on our blog.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nAlthough we've made headway with both the installer and the upcoming user\ninterface update this week, we've observed slower-than-usual progress on\nBasicSwap due to one of our developer falling ill and recovering for most of the\nweek. \n\nConsequently, the status of the following two items remains largely unchanged\nfrom last week.\n\nInstallation Wizard ?\nWe are still busy working on a few fixes and improvements to the BasicSwap\ninstallation wizard following community testing and feedback.

Let us take a moment to evaluate the advancements achieved in\nthe past few days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?️\nWe're still completing the items outlined in our previous updates, namely\nincluding enhancing Tor server capabilities and making a variety of minor\nimprovements.\n\nPlease note, however, that we are currently observing a delay that is impacting\nthe the development process of Particl Desktop which we hope to resolve shortly.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nInstallation Wizard ?\nThe installation wizard (.exe) for BasicSwap DEX is now fully complete. We have\ndistributed it to a few people to test on different Windows versions, and will\nbe ready to push it live this coming Monday!\n\nThe installer simplifies the entire BasicSwap installation and configuration\nprocess using a graphical interface, eliminating the need for terminal\ninteractions. To ensure a successful installation, please make sure to run the\ninstaller as an administrator, as it fetches certain dependencies during the\nprocess.\n\nNote that, currently, the DEX must still be launched via the terminal. However,\nclear instructions are provided on the GUI upon the completion of the\ninstallation. We will be working to include a workaround to this over the\nweekend, but if we can't make it on time for this coming Monday release, we'll\nadd it in a subsequent update.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nWith the BasicSwap installer essentially ready for release, we're now shifting\nour focus back to BasicSwap's 2.1 UI and UX update, which we've mentioned a few\nprogress reports ago. \n\nAs a refresher, here is a list of items to be included in this update, with a\ncouple of others currently in progress right now:\n\nUI/UX Changes\n * The Place New Offer page has been redesigned for a cleaner look, featuring\n   options to toggle between simple and advanced modes.\n * The steps for placing a new offer have been simplified.\n * Notifications in the main menu, as well as pop-ups, have been redesigned.\n * The settings page layout has also been redesigned.\n * A new setting allows users to choose their default currency for\n   prices/graphs, such as USD, EUR, or Pound.\n * The layout of the Network Order Book page has been revamped.\n * The \"Swaps in Progress\" page has been redesigned.\n * Both the main menu and sub-menu have been redesigned, now with a better UX\n   logic.\n * Styling improvements have been made to the (SMSG) identity page.\n * The withdrawal section of the single wallet page has also received styling\n   and UX improvements.\n * Better styling for shutdown/error/ pages.\n * Styling for alerts and errors has been revamped.\n * JavaScript browser alerts have been replaced with sleek modals and pop-ups.\n * \"Spinner\" animations have been added for both confirmation and waiting\n   periods.\n * Icons have been appended to all primary buttons.\n * Prices are now displayed on the individual offer/bid pages.\n * Various other tweaks, corrections, and code clean-up have been implemented.\n\nChart and Price Display\n * A new option now lets you only display the coins activated on the Network\n   Order Book Page.\n * Preparations are underway for the introduction of two new privacy coins,\n   including their prices, icons, and graphs.\n * The script calculating the volume of each coin has been restructured, and now\n   includes also USDT as a volume measure from exchanges.\n * Added coin volume bars overlay in the main chart.\n\nAdditionally, we've made a couple of changes and improvements to BasicSwap's\nofficial website — BasicSwapDEX.com [https://basicswapdex.com] — which should go\nlive around the same time as the 2.1 UI update.\n\nBasicSwapDEX.com Website Updates\n * Added dark mode as default.\n * Various GFX/layout tweaks and fixes\n * General UX improvements.\n * Added current coins supported (GFX) + table.\n * Fetch BasicSwap-related blog news and show last 4 items on main page.\n\nAdding New Coins ?\nWe are currently in touch with the Navcoin coin team to review the integration\nof the privacy coin into BasicSwap DEX as it has given us a few challenges. As\nit stands now, the integration should work, but isn't officially supported yet\nuntil we find a more stable way to run and sync the nodes.\n\nGiven the circumstances, we are now considering postponing official support for\nit until after the implementation of light services to the DEX, like Electrum or\nBlockbook integrations for instance. \n\nThis approach will facilitate the smoother integration of not just this coin,\nbut future ones as well. Additionally, it will grant many user experience\nbenefits such as taking out the need for syncing the complete blockchains of\neach enabled coin and maintaining multiple nodes at the same time (including\nhaving to manually update core versions whenever important core updates are\npushed).\n\nIf you still want to test the Navcoin integration in its current state, first\nensure that you're running the latest version of BasicSwap DEX and that it is\nnot currently running. Enable the use of disabled coins by typing the export\nOVERRIDE_DISABLED_COINS=true command from your BasicSwap folder, and then\nproceed to run the usual commands to add new coins to the DEX, which in the case\nof NAV, would be as follows:\n\ndocker-compose stop\nexport COINDATA_PATH=/var/data/coinswaps\ndocker run --rm -t --name swap_prepare -v $COINDATA_PATH:/coindata i_swapclient basicswap-prepare --datadir=/coindata --addcoin=navcoin\n\n> Note: A snapshot of their blockchain can be downloaded here\n[https://info.navcoin.org/navcoin-core/bootstrap-your-wallet/] to speed up the\nsyncing process.\n> Note 2: You can consult the related code by checking out the Navcoin integration\ncommit here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commit/4d8d421de65d32a3ae073d9166ff02824ab513f4]\n.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

We will resume this\ntask in the coming week.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nWe are in the final stages of a significant UI/UX interface update for BasicSwap\nDEX, which will soon be ready for release. It combines weeks of work aimed at\nenhancing both the user experience and interface. Below is a non-exhaustive list\nof the most notable items to be included in BasicSwap's 2.1 UI update.\n\nUI/UX Changes\n * The Place New Offer page has been redesigned for a cleaner look, featuring\n   options to toggle between simple and advanced modes.\n * The steps for placing a new offer have been simplified.\n * Notifications in the main menu, as well as pop-ups, have been redesigned.\n * The settings page layout has also been redesigned.\n * A new setting allows users to choose their default currency for\n   prices/graphs, such as USD, EUR, or Pound.\n * The layout of the Network Order Book page has been revamped.\n * The \"Swaps in Progress\" page has been redesigned.\n * Both the main menu and sub-menu have been redesigned, now with a better UX\n   logic.\n * Styling improvements have been made to the (SMSG) identity page.\n * The withdrawal section of the single wallet page has also received styling\n   and UX improvements.\n * Better styling for shutdown/error/ pages.\n * Styling for alerts and errors has been revamped.\n * JavaScript browser alerts have been replaced with sleek modals and pop-ups.\n * \"Spinner\" animations have been added for both confirmation and waiting\n   periods.\n * Icons have been appended to all primary buttons.\n * Prices are now displayed on the individual offer/bid pages.\n * Various other tweaks, corrections, and code clean-up have been implemented.\n\nChart and Price Display\n * A new option now lets you only display the coins activated on the Network\n   Order Book Page.\n * Preparations are underway for the introduction of two new privacy coins,\n   including their prices, icons, and graphs.\n * The script calculating the volume of each coin has been restructured, and now\n   includes also USDT as a volume measure from exchanges.\n * Added coin volume bars overlay in the main chart.\n\nAdditionally, we've made a couple of changes and improvements to BasicSwap's\nofficial website — BasicSwapDEX.com [https://basicswapdex.com] — which should go\nlive around the same time as the 2.1 UI update.\n\nBasicSwapDEX.com Website Updates\n * Added dark mode as default.\n * Various GFX/layout tweaks and fixes\n * General UX improvements.\n * Added current coins supported (GFX) + table.\n * Fetch BasicSwap-related blog news and show last 4 items on main page.\n\nNew Particl Website ✅\nWe've also been making steady progress on the new website, as has been the case\nfor the past couple of weeks, which we now expect to have a working version in\ninternal testing soon. \n\nAs it stands today, the design and implementation is mostly complete, and we're\nin the final stages of making adjustments, addressing the last-minute GFX tweaks\nand perfecting the layout.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

Notably, it allows for withdrawals of up to 30 BTC per day without the\nneed for intrusive KYC verifications.\n\nWe're optimistic that this new listing, along with the new trading tools it\nrenders accessible to the community such as Hummingbot [https://hummingbot.org/] \nfor example, will improve the trading environment and conditions for the PART\ncoin, effectively broadening its accessibility to a wider audience than ever\nbefore since the project's initial launch in 2017.\n\nUsing Hummingbot ?\nHummingbot - the open source OS for crypto algo tradersHummingbot documentation\nand websitelogoHummingbot Foundation [https://hummingbot.org/]If you've been\nlooking to trade PART or contribute liquidity to its available markets, the MEXC\nlisting is bound to be a major boon for you on that end. \n\nIndeed, a big benefit of MEXC is that it's compatible with the powerful, free,\nand open-source Hummingbot market making and automated trading tool, which means\nyou can now use it to trade PART/USDT leveraging your own custom automated\nstrategies or one from the large array of pre-made templates\n[https://hummingbot.org/strategies/].\n\nAs such, we invite you to take a look at their website, who knows, perhaps\nyou'll find something interesting that also contributes to healthy trading\nconditions for PART at the same time!\n\nParticl Desktop ?️\nWe're still completing the items outlined in our previous updates, namely\nincluding enhancing Tor server capabilities and making a variety of minor\nimprovements.\n\nPlease note, however, that we are currently observing a delay that is impacting\nthe the development process of Particl Desktop which we hope to resolve shortly.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core.

However, we believe that starting next week should see the\nbeginning of the testing process for some of these coins as we're finally coming\nto the end of their integration process.\n\nDon't forget that, as part of their integration process, we've reworked some of\nthe components of the DEX to make it more readily compatible with a wider array\nof coins, which means we'll generally be able to integrate new coins more easily\nin the future.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nWe're continuing work on refining the New Offer page, along with integrating\nmore minor improvements to the user interface.

You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nExploring New Coin Additions ?\nThis week, we've continued the process of exploring new coins for inclusion on\nBasicSwap and started working on a few integrations.\n\nIn the process, we've encountered unique challenges that necessitated\nimprovements to the BasicSwap codebase. Inded, while the Particl blockchain can\ninterpret transactions from various coins, the reverse isn't always true for\nsome of the coins we're aiming to integrate. Given that BasicSwap was initially\ndesigned for a swift launch with the initial coin release lineup we had at that\ntime, certain assets we're considering now aren't fully compatible with specific\naspects of the existing codebase. \n\nConsequently, we've now opted to embed additional functionalities directly into\nBasicSwap to ensure broader cryptocurrency compatibility moving forward. While\nthese modifications aren't too extensive or expected to become time-consuming,\nthey have been a focal point of our work this week.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nIn addition to the minor cosmetic updates highlighted in last week's report, \nwe've begun refining the New Offer page. Our aim is to streamline the user\nexperience by tucking most advanced options into a collapsible menu and focusing\ninstead on what coins, and what amounts, users want to swap. \n\nThis approach ensures a quicker and more intuitive interface, preventing users\nfrom being overwhelmed by technical choices. However, these options remain\neasily accessible for advanced users who seek them.\n\nPrepare Your Nodes, Voting Starts Tuesday ?️ \nTeam Funding Proposal #4Learn all the details about the Particl team’s fourth\nfunding request from the Treasury Fund.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/team-funding-proposal-4/]Last week, we have published a\nfourth funding request to ensure the continued growth of the Particl project and\nto support the wide-ranging operations of the team.\n\nWe can now announce that voting will start next Tuesday and last from block \n1,493,000 to block 1,498,039, for a total of 5,040 blocks.\n\nBecause this proposal does not propose changes to the protocol, it will require\na participation rate of 20% or more of the total supply and an approval rate of\n60% or more to be considered valid.\n\n> Note: The accompanying CCS page of the proposal should be up in the next couple\nof hours, after which we'll publish a standalone blog post announcing the voting\nparameters and instructions on Particl News.\nHow to Vote ℹ️\nTo cast your vote for this proposal, we recommend using the partyman cold\nstaking application and register your vote on the blockchain for proposal #19. \n\nYou have the options to abstain (0), vote in favor (1), or vote against (2).\nEvery vote matters, and we strongly encourage you to participate as a higher\nparticipation rate means a broader consensus and healthier decision-making\nprocess for the whole community.\n\n * To learn more about Particl's on-chain voting system, click here\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-blockchain/blockchain_governance.html]\n   .\n * To learn how to vote, refer to this tutorial\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/part-guides/partguides_voting.html].\n * For the CCS voting page of this proposal, head over here\n   [https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/team-funding-request-4.html].\n\n> Important: For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are running\nthe latest version of Partyman.
