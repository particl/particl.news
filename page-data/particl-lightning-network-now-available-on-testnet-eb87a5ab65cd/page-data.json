It enables fast payments at a\nnear-zero fee and can scale extremely well, making it ideal to accommodate large\nnumbers of transactions per second. The Lightning Network can, in theory,\nsupport many more transactions per second than to credit card providers and\npopular online payment processors.\n\nLND will support the Particl blockchain and allow it to support large amounts of\ntraffic without being negatively impacted by it. It is an important piece for\nthe envisioned Particl technology stack and is instrumental to the network’s\nability to reach mainstream adoption.\n\nWhat the Lightning Network also enables is the decentralized, cross-chain\nexchange of cryptocurrencies. When two blockchains both have compatible\nLightning Network implementations running, cross-chain cryptocurrency trades can\nbe executed without any intermediary being required to ensure both parties stay\nhonest and honor their end of the deal. This type of exchange is very similar to\natomic swaps, but potentially more flexible.\n\nWhat are the Benefits?\nThe Lightning Network provides many benefits to the blockchains that are\ncompatible with it and opt to implement it.\n\nInstant Payments\nLightning-fast blockchain payments without worrying about block confirmation\ntimes. Security is enforced by blockchain smart-contracts without creating a\nblockchain transaction for individual payments. Payment speed measured in\nmilliseconds to seconds.\n\nScalability\nCapable of millions to billions of transactions per second across the network.\nCapacity blows away legacy payment rails by many orders of magnitude. Attaching\npayment per action/click is now possible without custodians.\n\nLow Cost\nBy transacting and settling off-blockchain, the Lightning Network allows for \nexceptionally low fees, which allows for emerging use cases such as instant\nmicro-payments.\n\nCross Blockchains\nCross-chain atomic swaps can occur off-chain instantly with heterogeneous\nblockchain consensus rules. So long as the chains can support the same\ncryptographic hash function, it is possible to make transactions across\nblockchains without trust in 3rd party custodians.\n\n> Source: https://lightning.network/\nTest it Yourself!\nIt is now possible to test the Lightning Network yourself! Because the\nimplementation is currently pretty bare-bone, it is mostly recommended for\nadvanced users. If you would like to give it a go, use Tecnovert’s Particl LND\nscript displayed below.\n\n> Note: This script runs on RegTest (pre-testnet)\nIf you have questions about Particl LND, join our Discord channel\n[http://discord.me/particl] and look for the #testing or #Open-Development \nchannel.\n\nSo What’s Next?\nThere is still a lot to do, more stability to achieve, and more testing required\nbefore Particl LND can be used with real funds. This script lays the foundation\nof what will later become a much more user-friendly integration of the Lightning\nNetwork on Particl, but at the moment, it is still reserved for the more\nadvanced users.\n\nOne thing we are particularly excited with is the integration of Confidential\nTransactions onto the Lightning Network, or what we like to call Blinded \nLightning. This untraceable version of the Lightning Network will become an\nimportant piece of Particl’s technology stack and will let the public benefit\nfrom a lightning fast currency that provably respects their right to privacy!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Lightning-Network-Now-Available-on-Testnet/1-0sXEQ34b__FVXhqUwAGKLg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"-first-testnet-particl-lnd-transaction-successful-\">⚡️First Testnet Particl LND Transaction Successful⚡️</h3><p>Last week, Particl’s Core Developer and Cryptographer, <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert\"><strong>Tecnovert</strong></a>, successfully conducted the first ever Particl Lightning Network (LND) transaction.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://explorer-testnet.particl.io/tx/bd6f69315e9413e5f8b987fb676d192c28e8e1b15a611701bf1cdecb090f9552\">https://explorer-testnet.particl.io/tx/bd6f69315e9413e5f8b987fb676d192c28e8e1b15a611701bf1cdecb090f9552</a> <strong>(Fee: 0.00000963 PART)</strong></li><li><a href=\"https://explorer-testnet.particl.io/tx/aa55ef38ee1f619de8ea00d02a403f2508bae87d98978d868230e8a67e804b72\">https://explorer-testnet.particl.io/tx/aa55ef38ee1f619de8ea00d02a403f2508bae87d98978d868230e8a67e804b72</a> <strong>(Fee: 0.00001831 PART)</strong></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Lightning-Network-Now-Available-on-Testnet/1-fxMVOo_ApxLtXbDogpDLPQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Transaction Fee: Fee: 0.00000963 PART</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-s-the-lightning-network\">What’s the Lightning Network?</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Lightning-Network-Now-Available-on-Testnet/1-jG2LXZO6B7tHk23aKP14tg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>https://blockstream.com/lightning/</figcaption></figure><p>The Lightning Network (LND) is a payment protocol that runs parallel to a blockchain.

The Particl\nAwareness Campaign has been overwhelmingly successful in a short period of time!\nWe appreciate everyone’s effort as we’ve had more than 18,000 people\nparticipating, and 2,000 unique downloads of the marketplace. Thank you for\nparticipating, and please join https://t.me/particlawareness for any questions\nyou may have.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou and your friends are going to love using Particl!\n\nRecently, we introduced Community Contract Pools, a decentralized and\ncommunity-led program designed to fund various initiatives to raise awareness.\nWe’ve also announced that we’re kick-starting this new ‘pool economy’ by\ncreating an awareness campaign to acquire users before the imminent launch of\nour decentralized marketplace. This will be the first-ever initiative to be\nbacked by a Community Contract Pool!\n\nNow for all the nitty gritty details! We believe we’ve designed the best and\nmost innovative campaign to gain traction on our marketplace and get it started\non the right foot.\n\nEarn $PART Coins Just for Signing Up!\nGrab the products you’re looking for and pay for them with crypto!The Awareness\nCampaign’s mission is to acquire new users and kick-start the Particl economy,\nplain and simple. More users on the Particl Open Marketplace means more products\navailable for sale, more buyers looking for those products, and, of course,\nbetter privacy due to the nature of Particl’s CT & RingCT privacy protocol.\n\nA provably effective technique to acquire new users in the startup world is the\ntraditional referral system — get a friend to try the platform, and get some\nbenefits in return. We all know the very popular Dropbox referral model that, in\nexchange for referring friends, gives you free additional storage capacity on\nyour account.\n\nEarn More by Getting Your Friends to Sign Up!\nThe first Awareness Campaign is indeed a referral program, and it’s a damn good\none! It leverages Community Contract Pools to make it very appealing to\nparticipate in, as you’ll see. The rules are super simple.\n\nAwareness Campaign Rules\n * Visit https://friends.particl.community/\n * Register with your email to start participating in the campaign\n * Get your personal link and share it with your friends\n * Start raking in points\n\nPrizes\nGetting friends to use Particl is easy! Each friend you get to sign up nets you\n1 point and points earn you prizes paid in $PART.\n\n * Get $5 worth of $PART for signing up\n * Get $10 worth of $PART when 5 of your friends sign up\n * Get $20 worth of $PART when 10 of your friends sign up\n * Get 1 lifetime staking share per additional friend that signs up (10+)\n\nHow to Claim Your Prize\nTo claim your prize, all you need to do is send us, by email, a private address.\nDon’t worry, it’s actually pretty easy to acquire. Simply follow the steps\nbelow:\n\n * Download Particl Desktop [https://particl.io/downloads/] (mainnet)\n * Create a new account (make sure to backup your seed somewhere safe!)\n * Go to the RECEIVE tab located in the sidebar on the left\n * Click on the Private Address tab located at the top of the RECEIVE page\n * Click on the green Copy Address button to copy it to your clipboard\n * Send your private address to friends@particl.io with the same email you\n   signed up with to claim your prizes.\n\nHow to get your Particl private address and claim your rewards> Note: Payouts will exclusively be made using Confidential Transactions and\nrequire that you send us a private address. That means regular addresses, such\nas those used by exchanges, won’t work.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLifetime Staking Shares as Reward\nIn fact, participants who successfully get more than 10 of their friends to use\nParticl will earn lifetime shares of the Ambassador Community Contract Pool\n[https://stake.particl.community/]’s staking revenue.\n\nYes, you’ve heard that right!\n\nIf you teach 10 of your friends about the biggest revolution eCommerce has ever\nseen and get them to sign-up, you can start earning a steady income from this\npool for life!\n\nAs mentioned above, each friend you get to use Particl gives you one point. 10\npoints get you $20 worth of PART. But what if you go above and beyond and get\n25, 100, or even 1,000 people to use Particl!\n\nThat’s where it gets interesting…\n\nIn fact, once you reach 12 points, you’ll earn yourself a single share of the\nstaking revenue made by the Ambassador Community Contract Pool. Then, for each\nadditional friend you refer, you’ll get an additional share. Simply put, you get\n(X-11) shares for every friend you get to use Particl.\n\nFor example, if you get 34 (X) people to register their email to the campaign\nand use Particl, you’ll get 24 shares (X-10). If you refer 8 (X) friends, then\nyou’ll get 0 shares, but you’ll still earn $10 worth of PART since you\nsuccessfully got more than 5 of your friends to sign up.\n\nTo learn more about staking shares and the Ambassador Pool, read our Ambassador\nPool FAQ on Particl Wiki by following the link below.\n\nfaq_ambassador * Particl Project Wiki [https://particl.wiki/faq_ambassador]\nThe Ambassador Pool is the first-ever Community Contract Pool to support an\ninitiative.

Then, you’ll get\na custom link that you can send to your friends so they, also, can participate\nin this campaign and discover Particl at the same time.\n\nEach friend you refer to the platform earns you a point. You can earn $10 worth\nof PART if you get 5 friends to use Particl, and $20 worth of PART for 10\nfriends.\n\nOnce you reach 11 points, you’ll start earning lifetime shares of the staking\nrevenue made by the Ambassador Community Contract Pool.\n\nEasy, right? It doesn’t get more complicated than that!\n\nThe Fine Prints\n * The contest will run until the 16th of July, 2019.\n * To claim your prize, you need to send us a private address from the same\n   email you used to register to the campaign. Sending a private address\n   requires Particl Desktop and is not possible to do from Particl’s mobile\n   application.\n * Payouts will be executed for the first time on the 23rd of May 2019, and will\n   then be payed out every 2 weeks after that point.\n * Staking rewards, proportionally to how many shares you own, will be paid for\n   the first time on the 23rd of May 2019, and will then be paid out every 2\n   weeks after that point. Learn more about what are staking rewards here: \n   https://particl.wiki/faq_ambassador\n * The campaign has a hidden payout cap. If the amount of payouts executed\n   exceeds this cap, payouts will be disabled. After that point, it will only be\n   possible to earn staking shares.

The\nstaking rewards they collect are used to fund any initiative started by the\ncommunity, effectively bootstrapping the Particl economy and allowing it to be\nself-sufficient.\n\nThese pools are different from regular cold staking pools in that they can\ncharge up to 100% fees. This means stakers do not receive any staking reward\nfrom the number of coins being staked in this type of pool, but that doesn’t\nmean they don’t receive anything in return.\n\nFor more information about Community Contract Pools, please read our previous\narticle on the subject by clicking the box below.\n\nCommunity Contract Pools\n[https://particl.news/community-contract-pools-49a2b060f370]\nIf you've been around the community for some time, then you probably know that\nthere have always been some discussions…\n[https://particl.news/community-contract-pools-49a2b060f370]particl.news\n[https://particl.news/community-contract-pools-49a2b060f370]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGetting Started\nCommunity Contract Pools open up a lot of possibilities to expand and further\ndecentralize the Particl ecosystem. To get the ball rolling, we’re revealing\ntoday the first initiative to be supported by a Community Contract Pool: the \nAmbassador Initiative.\n\nWord of mouth is extremely important for any idea to gain traction in the\ncollective awareness of society. Our goal is to increase the velocity of the\nconversation surrounding the highly anticipated launch of the Particl\nMarketplace. And, this idea holds even more weight with us releasing a\nmarketplace because they are global platforms that purely rely on user activity\nto thrive.\n\nThis is the reason why we are announcing today the Particl Ambassador\nInitiative, an ambassador group actively advocating for Particl within their own\nsocial circles. This group will be directly supported by the first ever\nCommunity Contract Pool. The pool will award its ambassadors with staking\nrewards proportionally to their net performance in driving new people on the\nParticl platform.\n\nThe Ambassador Initiative\nThe Ambassador Initiative is a group of individuals that are passionate about\nParticl and are advocating for it within their own social circles. Ambassadors\nwill have the opportunity to earn lifetime shares of the pool’s staking revenue \nby participating in various campaigns.\n\nThe Mission\nThe ambassadors’ mission is simple: get people to sign-up and use the Particl\nplatform. It directly addresses the number one requirement for marketplaces to\ngain traction — getting as many active users as possible.\n\nIn order to achieve its mission, ambassadors will have the opportunity to\nparticipate in various campaigns, each of them having the objective to drive new\nusers to Particl.\n\nAmbassador Campaigns\nEvery once in a while, campaigns will become available for ambassadors. These\ncampaigns may be different from one to another, but their purpose will always be\nto fulfill the ambassadors’ mission of driving new users to Particl.\n\nCampaigns will usually last for several days or weeks and have their own rules\nand requirements. They will award participants with points which count as \nlifetime shares of the pool’s staking revenue.\n\nEarn PART\nBeing a Particl ambassador is, simply put, setting the income wheels in motion\nand keeping it in auto-pilot. In fact, when you participate in campaigns, you\nearn a percentage of the Community Contract Pool’s staking revenue by\naccumulating shares.\n\nYour performance within the lifespan of a campaign earns you more share. The\nnumber of shares you earn at the end of a challenge is directly proportional to\nyour performance.\n\nIt’s for Life!\n> Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed\nhim for a lifetime\nWhat’s really great about earning shares from the ambassador’s pool is that they\nare valid for a lifetime. This means that, once you earn a share, you keep it\nfor life. Imagine receiving a couple of staking rewards today, and still earn\nsome more a few years into the future!\n\nOn top of the lifetime characteristic of these shares, they are also cumulative.\nThat means you can get as many as you can, over as many campaigns as you want to\nparticipate in. There is no cap to how many shares you can accumulate as well as\nno penalty for not participating in campaigns. If there’s a campaign you can’t\nor don’t want to participate in, you won’t be penalized by losing shares you\nearned in the past.\n\nHow to Qualify as an Ambassador\nAnyone can qualify to become an ambassador. All you need to do is participate in\nambassador campaigns and start earning shares. Note that, most of the time,\nchallenges will require a minimum of scored points in order to qualify for the\npool’s reward program.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSupport Particl Ambassadors Today\nSupporting Particl ambassadors with a portion of your staking rewards is like\nmaking a sort of “staking investment” in the Particl ecosystem. It incentivizes\nand encourages ambassadors to go out there, help grow Particl’s userbase, and be\nfairly compensated for their valuable time.\n\nGrowing the number of users directly adds value to the network because it\nincreases the number of buyers, sellers, available products on the marketplace,\nand etc. It also dramatically increases the velocity of the Particl economy by\nputting more staking rewards in circulation, an issue often cited when referring\nto Proof-of-Stake networks. Additionally, more users transacting on the network\nmeans stronger privacy for everyone.\n\nSimply put, the added value an effective and motivated core of ambassadors can\nprovide to the network far exceeds what it costs to get it properly funded, \nespecially when it’s getting funded with staking rewards. It also puts the\nnetwork’s inflation to good use by having it directly contribute to its own\nbenefit.\n\nEven though the first ambassador campaign will only be announced in a few days,\nyou can still start supporting Particl ambassadors today by connecting a wallet\nto the Community Contract Pool at https://stake.particl.community.\n\nFor a complete step-by-step tutorial on how to connect to a Community Contract\nPool, visit the Wiki page here: https://particl.wiki/communitycontractpools\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Pool’s Parameters\n * Website: https://stake.particl.community\n * Operator: https://particl.community\n * Fee: 100%\n * Percentage of fees paid to ambassadors: 100%\n * Payout frequency: Every 2 weeks\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst Ambassador Campaign\nThe first ambassador campaign will be announced in a few days.

SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
