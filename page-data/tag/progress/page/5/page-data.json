However, they\nnecessitate that both cryptocurrencies involved in the exchange have\nprogrammable outputs, among other requirements. This swap type is available for\na wide array of coins, but not for Monero.\n\nAs the most commonly used 'privacy coin' today, Monero is particularly important\nfor BasicSwap’s goals, and boasts an extensive anonymity pool and high levels of\nfinancial privacy. This reinforces its impressive potential as an ideal digital\ncash form, but the concerted efforts in restraining its use by anti-freedom\nactors highlight the need for a counterparty-free trading solution.\n\nThat’s why Monero contributor, Joel Gugger — also known as H4sh3d — proposed a\nnew Monero-compatible atomic swap protocol based on adaptor signatures\n[https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126.pdf]. This breakthrough development, a\nproduct of the collaborative efforts of open-source developers over years,\nfinally opened the door to the facilitation of atomic swapping of Monero without\nthe need for programmable outputs.\n\n> Note: For a more in-depth look into the history of atomic swaps, check out our\nrecent blog post on the topic here\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n.\nThe Big Caveat to Monero Atomic Swaps\nWhile the advent of Monero atomic swaps using adaptor signatures represented a\nsignificant advancement, it came with a notable limitation: they could only\noperate in one direction. To clarify this, it's crucial to realize that in an\natomic swap, the roles of the participants are distinct: there's an 'offerer'\nand a 'bidder' (or ‘taker’).\n\nThe offerer creates a swap request — for BasicSwap, this means listing a swap\nrequest, often referred to as an 'offer', on the DEX's order book. The bidder,\nin contrast, reviews the terms of the swap request (the 'offer') and, upon\nagreement, initiates the swap process.\n\nThe offerer dictates the swap's parameters, including the offered and requested\ncoins, their respective quantities, and the exchange rate. While there are other\nparameters to set, such as the lock contract expiry time for example, they are\nnot specifically pertinent to this article's context.\n\nBasicSwap DEX's order bookDue to the technological foundation of semi-scriptless\natomic swaps, the offered coin must possess scriptable outputs, or more\naccurately, some form of malleability fix, often implemented as Segwit. This\nstipulation presents an improvement on HTLC swaps, which require programmable\noutputs for both coins, but in either cases, this prevents Monero from being\noffered in exchange for other coins, due to its lack of scriptable outputs.\n\nTo better understand this unidirectionality, consider this flow chart which\ndescribes a typical adaptor signature based atomic swap involving Monero, from\nthe perspective of the 'offerer'.\n\nSee flowchart from the bidder's perspective: \nhttps://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.bidder.alt.xu.min.svg\nNote that this does not imply that a Monero holder cannot swap it for Bitcoin —\na Bitcoin holder could create an offer to exchange Bitcoin for Monero, which the\nMonero user could then accept and initiate a swap. However, it does mean a\nMonero holder cannot be the one to create the offer. In other words, if you hold\nMonero and want Bitcoin, you must accept an offer created by someone else\nrequesting Monero for Bitcoin. If you hold Bitcoin and want Monero, then you\nmust create an offer offering Bitcoin for Monero.\n\nThis restriction considerably impacts the user experience in a negative way and\nadds complexity to the end user as it prevents them full access to the standard\nfunctionalities provided by atomic swaps and, more broadly, by centralized\ntrading exchanges. It also prevents Monero offerers from trading at the exact\nrate they want, as they are constrained to the rates of existing trade offers.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, we have devoted consistent effort to developing a\nsolution, with the goal of providing Monero users with the same advantages\nenjoyed by users of other coins on a DEX like BasicSwap.\n\nBidirectional Monero and Part (Anon) Swaps Are Here! ?\nWe are proud to announce that we’ve finally implemented bidirectional Monero\natomic swaps into BasicSwap mainnet, now available on the live beta and\naccessible for everyone! This breakthrough implies that the prior constraints on\nMonero users are no longer relevant, and that Monero users can now both request\nAND offer Monero when adding offers on BasicSwap's order book.\n\nHow was it Accomplished?\nMonero atomic swaps being solely a unidirectional process is a direct\nconsequence of Monero's robust codebase which offers limited scripting\ncapabilities, but enhanced resilience against different types of exploits.\n\nAs such, we achieved bidirectional swaps without altering the Monero codebase or\nmaking extensive changes to Joel Gugger’s adaptor signature-based Monero atomic\nswap protocol (beyond our previous enhancements to the protocol's privacy and\ntransaction size management, as detailed here\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements]\n).\n\nInstead, our strategy leveraged BasicSwap's strong suit — its use of the SMSG\nnetwork\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements] \nwith a focus on end user experience. After all, BasicSwap's primary goal as a\nDEX protocol is to simplify the process of atomic swaps and make it easy and\nmore accessible for people to transition away from centralized exchanges.\nTherefore, user experience is paramount and is what truly matters in our case.\n\nLeveraging the SMSG Network\nOn BasicSwap, the offerer creates a swap request or 'offer' on the DEX’s order\nbook, while participants (aka 'bidders') take a look at the order book, locate\nan offer that interests them, and initiate a swap. This process mirrors the\nmaker-taker system of traditional centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nHowever, this user experience isn't inherently part of atomic swap technology,\nas we've outlined in this blog post\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before]\n, but is facilitated by Particl's unique SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a\ndecentralized, privacy-first messaging network, also known as 'mixnets' (see \nthis article\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements] \nfor more information on SMSG).\n\nThe SMSG network serves as a powerful tool and a crucial component in making\nBasicSwap DEX a user-centric platform. Turns out, it also ultimately became the\nkey to implementing bidirectional Monero atomic swaps.\n\nSimulating Offers Requesting Monero\nOur solution to the unidirectionality of Monero atomic swaps doesn't hinge on\nmodifying the Monero codebase or its adaptor signature atomic swap protocol.\nInstead, it leverages the SMSG network to simulate offers featuring Monero.\n\nIn reality, BasicSwap still employs the same semi-scriptless adaptor signature\nprotocol. Hence, at the protocol level, the swaps remain unidirectional.\nHowever, by integrating an additional automated step into the swap process —\npowered by the SMSG network — we've made it appear as if Monero can now be\noffered.\n\nEven though it is fundamentally a clever workaround — essentially providing the\nillusion of a truly bidirectional swap — it is entirely seamless for the end\nuser and doesn't necessitate any additional manual input or requirements.\n\nRefer to the original adaptor signature atomic swap flow chart provided earlier\nin this article. Now, compare it to this flow chart displaying the process of\nexecuting a 'reverse Monero atomic swap' using adaptor signatures on BasicSwap\nDEX, again from the perspective of the offerer.\n\nSee reversed flowchart from the bidder's perspective: \nhttps://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.rev.bidder.xu.min.svg\nFrom this, it's clear that the base protocol stays the same, but there are a few\nmore steps and processing involved — all occurring in the background without\nnecessitating further human intervention.\n\nIndeed, whereas a PART (or BTC) to XMR swap would send a bid, a XMR to PART swap\ninstead sends a 'bid request' that has to be accepted by the bidder. A bid is\nthen constructed from this request and the protocol proceeds as normal, just\nwith the parties transposed.\n\nTechnical Documentation\ndoc: Describe reverse adaptor sig protocol. · tecnovert/basicswap@be46d8aBasic\nAtomic Swap Proof of Concept.

Now, in contrast to the previous setup where Monero could only be\nchosen as the requested coin, you also have the option to offer it when placing\na new offer on the order book.\n\nThere are no extra steps or additional prerequisites involved. However, remember\nthat this process is fundamentally a unidirectional atomic swap, enhanced with\nsome additional SMSG logic. Therefore, the other cryptocurrency you're\nrequesting should have some form of malleability fix in place, like Segwit, just\nlike any other adaptor signature-based atomic swap. \n\nTo benefit from the new bidirectional atomic swaps, all you need to do is ensure\nthat your local BasicSwap instance is up-to-date with the latest version. To\ninstall it, simply update BasicSwap through the usual process\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html] \n(video walkthrough [https://youtu.be/kk3FtE_TKBQ]) and launch the DEX again.\n\n * Shutdown BasicSwap properly and stop the Docker image.\n * From the basicswap folder, type the git pull command.\n * In the /docker folder, run the docker-compose build command.\n * Once the process completes, launch BasicSwap again using the docker-compose\n   up command.\n\nIf you're not using the Docker setup, you can follow the Particl Academy's\nstep-by-step update guide here\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html]\n.\n\nWhat Impact Will This Have on Our Future?\nThe introduction of bidirectional Monero atomic swaps for all symbolizes a\nmonumental step towards establishing a privacy-first, resilient global economy\nthat is fair to all.\n\nIndeed, we've observed a steady increase in aggressive, restrictive measures\ntargeting privacy coins like Particl and Monero in recent years, a trend that\nhas only accelerated in recent weeks. As evidenced by the removal of the\ncryptocurrency from numerous centralized exchanges such as Binance, the\naccessibility of Monero has significantly dwindled for many individuals\nworldwide, even though it remains legal. The rate at which these measures are\nbeing enforced is only likely to speed up over time.\n\nFurthermore, increasingly complicated regulations targeting custodial\ncryptocurrency businesses (referred to as \"MSB\") are being enshrined in law or,\nat the very least, being seriously considered by several governments across the\nworld, highlighting a dire need for more self-custodial solutions such as\nBasicSwap DEX. As these circumstances evolve, it becomes increasingly clear that\ncryptocurrencies like Monero and truly decentralized and self-custodial\nsolutions like BasicSwap DEX, which have remained compliant with the various\nglobal regulations, are needed.\n\nDecentralized Trading Exchanges: The Ultimate Refuge\nFortunately, truly decentralized trading exchanges (DEXs), which operate\nentirely without any central component or service provider, are still allowed\nand serve as safe haven in the preservation of crypto's root values. Monero's\nwidespread availability on these platforms is critical not only for its\nsurvival, but also for the preservation of our human rights.\n\nHowever, the absence of programmable outputs in Monero has been a long-standing\nchallenge when integrating them into these platforms. This situation has\nresulted in Monero having one of the lowest presences amongst popular\ncryptocurrencies on such decentralized exchanges. The arrival of adaptor\nsignature-based atomic swaps initiated a change, but until now, the inability to\nexecute bidirectional atomic swaps posed an understandable but significant\nbarrier to the Monero community's extensive use of atomic swaps.\n\nThe integration of bidirectional Monero atomic swaps into the BasicSwap DEX\nmarks a shift in this scenario, reinforcing our conviction in the significance\nof today's announcement.\n\nThe Road Ahead\nOf course, there’s a lot of work that still needs to be done. For instance,\nBasicSwap, operating as a local application hosting various blockchains, remains\nrelatively complex to initiate. Even though we've streamlined the setup process\nwith the soon-to-come release of an executable (.exe) installer and launcher,\nthe resultant user experience still falls short when compared to centralized\nexchanges — although, once set up, it operates in remarkably similar ways.\n\nThis fact underscores our recent emphasis on developing a web framework that\nwill equip BasicSwap to deliver web services and power decentralized trading\nplatforms on the web. With this major headway, platforms will be able to harness\nBasicSwap's unparalleled decentralization and uncompromising privacy without\nhaving to run a local application, synchronize chains, or deposit coins into web\nwallets.\n\nWhile this major upgrade is still under construction, the launch of\nbidirectional Monero atomic swaps on BasicSwap today frees up more resources for\nthe development of this crucial web infrastructure, making it now our prime\nfocus moving forward.\n\nWe encourage you to stay tuned to our blog at Particl News\n[https://particl.news] for updates on this topic.

However, they necessitate that both cryptocurrencies involved in the exchange have programmable outputs, among other requirements. This swap type is available for a wide array of coins, but not for Monero.</p><p>As the most commonly used 'privacy coin' today, Monero is particularly important for BasicSwap’s goals, and boasts an extensive anonymity pool and high levels of financial privacy. This reinforces its impressive potential as an ideal digital cash form, but the concerted efforts in restraining its use by anti-freedom actors highlight the need for a counterparty-free trading solution.</p><p>That’s why Monero contributor, Joel Gugger — also known as H4sh3d — proposed <strong><a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126.pdf\">a new Monero-compatible atomic swap protocol based on adaptor signatures</a></strong>. This breakthrough development, a product of the collaborative efforts of open-source developers over years, finally opened the door to the facilitation of atomic swapping of Monero without the need for programmable outputs.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> For a more in-depth look into the history of atomic swaps, check out our recent blog post on the topic <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/\">here</a></strong>.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"the-big-caveat-to-monero-atomic-swaps\">The Big Caveat to Monero Atomic Swaps</h2><p>While the advent of Monero atomic swaps using adaptor signatures represented a significant advancement, it came with a notable limitation: they could only operate in one direction. To clarify this, it's crucial to realize that in an atomic swap, the roles of the participants are distinct: there's an 'offerer' and a 'bidder' (or ‘taker’).</p><p>The offerer creates a swap request — for BasicSwap, this means listing a swap request, often referred to as an 'offer', on the DEX's order book. The bidder, in contrast, reviews the terms of the swap request (the 'offer') and, upon agreement, initiates the swap process.</p><p>The offerer dictates the swap's parameters, including the offered and requested coins, their respective quantities, and the exchange rate. While there are other parameters to set, such as the lock contract expiry time for example, they are not specifically pertinent to this article's context.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/08/image-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/image-2.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/image-2.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/08/image-2.png 1099w\"><figcaption><strong><em>BasicSwap DEX's order book</em></strong></figcaption></figure><p>Due to the technological foundation of semi-scriptless atomic swaps, the offered coin must possess scriptable outputs, or more accurately, some form of malleability fix, often implemented as Segwit. This stipulation presents an improvement on HTLC swaps, which require programmable outputs for both coins, but in either cases, this prevents Monero from being offered in exchange for other coins, due to its lack of scriptable outputs.</p><p>To better understand this unidirectionality, consider this flow chart which describes a typical adaptor signature based atomic swap involving Monero, from the perspective of the 'offerer'.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/08/image-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/image-4.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/image-4.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/08/image-4.png 1264w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption><em><strong>See flowchart from the bidder's perspective: </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.bidder.alt.xu.min.svg\">https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.bidder.alt.xu.min.svg</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>Note that this does not imply that a Monero holder cannot swap it for Bitcoin — a Bitcoin holder could create an offer to exchange Bitcoin for Monero, which the Monero user could then accept and initiate a swap. However, it does mean a Monero holder cannot be the one to create the offer. In other words, if you hold Monero and want Bitcoin, you must accept an offer created by someone else requesting Monero for Bitcoin. If you hold Bitcoin and want Monero, then you must create an offer offering Bitcoin for Monero.</p><p>This restriction considerably impacts the user experience in a negative way and adds complexity to the end user as it prevents them full access to the standard functionalities provided by atomic swaps and, more broadly, by centralized trading exchanges. It also prevents Monero offerers from trading at the exact rate they want, as they are constrained to the rates of existing trade offers.</p><p>To mitigate this issue, we have devoted consistent effort to developing a solution, with the goal of providing Monero users with the same advantages enjoyed by users of other coins on a DEX like BasicSwap.</p><h2 id=\"bidirectional-monero-and-part-anon-swaps-are-here-\">Bidirectional Monero and Part (Anon) Swaps Are Here! ?</h2><p>We are proud to announce that we’ve finally implemented bidirectional Monero atomic swaps into BasicSwap mainnet, now available on the live beta and accessible for everyone! This breakthrough implies that the prior constraints on Monero users are no longer relevant, and that Monero users can now both request AND offer Monero when adding offers on BasicSwap's order book.</p><h1 id=\"how-was-it-accomplished\">How was it Accomplished?</h1><p>Monero atomic swaps being solely a unidirectional process is a direct consequence of Monero's robust codebase which offers limited scripting capabilities, but enhanced resilience against different types of exploits.</p><p>As such, we achieved bidirectional swaps without altering the Monero codebase or making extensive changes to Joel Gugger’s adaptor signature-based Monero atomic swap protocol (beyond our previous enhancements to the protocol's privacy and transaction size management, as detailed <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\">here</a></strong>).</p><p>Instead, our strategy leveraged BasicSwap's strong suit — its use of the <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\"><strong>SMSG network</strong></a> with a focus on end user experience. After all, BasicSwap's primary goal as a DEX protocol is to simplify the process of atomic swaps and make it easy and more accessible for people to transition away from centralized exchanges. Therefore, user experience is paramount and is what truly matters in our case.</p><h2 id=\"leveraging-the-smsg-network\">Leveraging the SMSG Network</h2><p>On BasicSwap, the offerer creates a swap request or 'offer' on the DEX’s order book, while participants (aka 'bidders') take a look at the order book, locate an offer that interests them, and initiate a swap. This process mirrors the maker-taker system of traditional centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.</p><p>However, this user experience isn't inherently part of atomic swap technology, as we've outlined in <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before\">this blog post</a></strong>, but is facilitated by Particl's unique SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a decentralized, privacy-first messaging network, also known as 'mixnets' (see <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\">this article</a></strong> for more information on SMSG).</p><p>The SMSG network serves as a powerful tool and a crucial component in making BasicSwap DEX a user-centric platform. Turns out, it also ultimately became the key to implementing bidirectional Monero atomic swaps.</p><h2 id=\"simulating-offers-requesting-monero\">Simulating Offers Requesting Monero</h2><p>Our solution to the unidirectionality of Monero atomic swaps doesn't hinge on modifying the Monero codebase or its adaptor signature atomic swap protocol. Instead, it leverages the SMSG network to simulate offers featuring Monero.</p><p>In reality, BasicSwap still employs the same semi-scriptless adaptor signature protocol. Hence, at the protocol level, the swaps remain unidirectional. However, by integrating an additional automated step into the swap process — powered by the SMSG network — we've made it appear as if Monero can now be offered.</p><p>Even though it is fundamentally a clever workaround — essentially providing the illusion of a truly bidirectional swap — it is entirely seamless for the end user and doesn't necessitate any additional manual input or requirements.</p><p>Refer to the original adaptor signature atomic swap flow chart provided earlier in this article. Now, compare it to this flow chart displaying the process of executing a 'reverse Monero atomic swap' using adaptor signatures on BasicSwap DEX, again from the perspective of the offerer.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/08/image-3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/image-3.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/image-3.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/08/image-3.png 1272w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption><em><strong>See reversed flowchart from the bidder's perspective: </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.rev.bidder.xu.min.svg\">https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.rev.bidder.xu.min.svg</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>From this, it's clear that the base protocol stays the same, but there are a few more steps and processing involved — all occurring in the background without necessitating further human intervention.</p><p>Indeed, whereas a PART (or BTC) to XMR swap would send a bid, a XMR to PART swap instead sends a 'bid request' that has to be accepted by the bidder.

However, remember that this process is fundamentally a unidirectional atomic swap, enhanced with some additional SMSG logic. Therefore, the other cryptocurrency you're requesting should have some form of malleability fix in place, like Segwit, just like any other adaptor signature-based atomic swap. </p><p>To benefit from the new bidirectional atomic swaps, all you need to do is ensure that your local BasicSwap instance is up-to-date with the latest version.

As evidenced by the removal of the cryptocurrency from numerous centralized exchanges such as Binance, the accessibility of Monero has significantly dwindled for many individuals worldwide, even though it remains legal. The rate at which these measures are being enforced is only likely to speed up over time.</p><p>Furthermore, increasingly complicated regulations targeting custodial cryptocurrency businesses (referred to as \"MSB\") are being enshrined in law or, at the very least, being seriously considered by several governments across the world, highlighting a dire need for more self-custodial solutions such as BasicSwap DEX. As these circumstances evolve, it becomes increasingly clear that cryptocurrencies like Monero and <strong>truly decentralized and self-custodial solutions</strong> like BasicSwap DEX, which have remained compliant with the various global regulations, are needed.</p><h2 id=\"decentralized-trading-exchanges-the-ultimate-refuge\">Decentralized Trading Exchanges: The Ultimate Refuge</h2><p>Fortunately, truly decentralized trading exchanges (DEXs), which operate entirely without any central component or service provider, are still allowed and serve as safe haven in the preservation of crypto's root values. Monero's widespread availability on these platforms is critical not only for its survival, but also for the preservation of our human rights.</p><p>However, the absence of programmable outputs in Monero has been a long-standing challenge when integrating them into these platforms. This situation has resulted in Monero having one of the lowest presences amongst popular cryptocurrencies on such decentralized exchanges. The arrival of adaptor signature-based atomic swaps initiated a change, but until now, the inability to execute bidirectional atomic swaps posed an understandable but significant barrier to the Monero community's extensive use of atomic swaps.</p><p>The integration of bidirectional Monero atomic swaps into the BasicSwap DEX marks a shift in this scenario, reinforcing our conviction in the significance of today's announcement.</p><h2 id=\"the-road-ahead\">The Road Ahead</h2><p>Of course, there’s a lot of work that still needs to be done. For instance, BasicSwap, operating as a local application hosting various blockchains, remains relatively complex to initiate. Even though we've streamlined the setup process with the soon-to-come release of an executable (.exe) installer and launcher, the resultant user experience still falls short when compared to centralized exchanges — although, once set up, it operates in remarkably similar ways.</p><p>This fact underscores our recent emphasis on developing a web framework that will equip BasicSwap to deliver web services and power decentralized trading platforms on the web.

However, they necessitate that both cryptocurrencies involved in the exchange have programmable outputs, among other requirements. This swap type is available for a wide array of coins, but not for Monero.</p><p>As the most commonly used 'privacy coin' today, Monero is particularly important for BasicSwap’s goals, and boasts an extensive anonymity pool and high levels of financial privacy. This reinforces its impressive potential as an ideal digital cash form, but the concerted efforts in restraining its use by anti-freedom actors highlight the need for a counterparty-free trading solution.</p><p>That’s why Monero contributor, Joel Gugger — also known as H4sh3d — proposed <strong><a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126.pdf\">a new Monero-compatible atomic swap protocol based on adaptor signatures</a></strong>. This breakthrough development, a product of the collaborative efforts of open-source developers over years, finally opened the door to the facilitation of atomic swapping of Monero without the need for programmable outputs.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> For a more in-depth look into the history of atomic swaps, check out our recent blog post on the topic <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/\">here</a></strong>.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"the-big-caveat-to-monero-atomic-swaps\">The Big Caveat to Monero Atomic Swaps</h2><p>While the advent of Monero atomic swaps using adaptor signatures represented a significant advancement, it came with a notable limitation: they could only operate in one direction. To clarify this, it's crucial to realize that in an atomic swap, the roles of the participants are distinct: there's an 'offerer' and a 'bidder' (or ‘taker’).</p><p>The offerer creates a swap request — for BasicSwap, this means listing a swap request, often referred to as an 'offer', on the DEX's order book. The bidder, in contrast, reviews the terms of the swap request (the 'offer') and, upon agreement, initiates the swap process.</p><p>The offerer dictates the swap's parameters, including the offered and requested coins, their respective quantities, and the exchange rate. While there are other parameters to set, such as the lock contract expiry time for example, they are not specifically pertinent to this article's context.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2023/08/image-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2023/08/image-2.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2023/08/image-2.png 1000w, /glink/2023/08/image-2.png 1099w\"><figcaption><strong><em>BasicSwap DEX's order book</em></strong></figcaption></figure><p>Due to the technological foundation of semi-scriptless atomic swaps, the offered coin must possess scriptable outputs, or more accurately, some form of malleability fix, often implemented as Segwit. This stipulation presents an improvement on HTLC swaps, which require programmable outputs for both coins, but in either cases, this prevents Monero from being offered in exchange for other coins, due to its lack of scriptable outputs.</p><p>To better understand this unidirectionality, consider this flow chart which describes a typical adaptor signature based atomic swap involving Monero, from the perspective of the 'offerer'.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2023/08/image-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2023/08/image-4.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2023/08/image-4.png 1000w, /glink/2023/08/image-4.png 1264w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption><em><strong>See flowchart from the bidder's perspective: </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.bidder.alt.xu.min.svg\">https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.bidder.alt.xu.min.svg</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>Note that this does not imply that a Monero holder cannot swap it for Bitcoin — a Bitcoin holder could create an offer to exchange Bitcoin for Monero, which the Monero user could then accept and initiate a swap. However, it does mean a Monero holder cannot be the one to create the offer. In other words, if you hold Monero and want Bitcoin, you must accept an offer created by someone else requesting Monero for Bitcoin. If you hold Bitcoin and want Monero, then you must create an offer offering Bitcoin for Monero.</p><p>This restriction considerably impacts the user experience in a negative way and adds complexity to the end user as it prevents them full access to the standard functionalities provided by atomic swaps and, more broadly, by centralized trading exchanges. It also prevents Monero offerers from trading at the exact rate they want, as they are constrained to the rates of existing trade offers.</p><p>To mitigate this issue, we have devoted consistent effort to developing a solution, with the goal of providing Monero users with the same advantages enjoyed by users of other coins on a DEX like BasicSwap.</p><h2 id=\"bidirectional-monero-and-part-anon-swaps-are-here-\">Bidirectional Monero and Part (Anon) Swaps Are Here! ?</h2><p>We are proud to announce that we’ve finally implemented bidirectional Monero atomic swaps into BasicSwap mainnet, now available on the live beta and accessible for everyone! This breakthrough implies that the prior constraints on Monero users are no longer relevant, and that Monero users can now both request AND offer Monero when adding offers on BasicSwap's order book.</p><h1 id=\"how-was-it-accomplished\">How was it Accomplished?</h1><p>Monero atomic swaps being solely a unidirectional process is a direct consequence of Monero's robust codebase which offers limited scripting capabilities, but enhanced resilience against different types of exploits.</p><p>As such, we achieved bidirectional swaps without altering the Monero codebase or making extensive changes to Joel Gugger’s adaptor signature-based Monero atomic swap protocol (beyond our previous enhancements to the protocol's privacy and transaction size management, as detailed <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\">here</a></strong>).</p><p>Instead, our strategy leveraged BasicSwap's strong suit — its use of the <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\"><strong>SMSG network</strong></a> with a focus on end user experience. After all, BasicSwap's primary goal as a DEX protocol is to simplify the process of atomic swaps and make it easy and more accessible for people to transition away from centralized exchanges. Therefore, user experience is paramount and is what truly matters in our case.</p><h2 id=\"leveraging-the-smsg-network\">Leveraging the SMSG Network</h2><p>On BasicSwap, the offerer creates a swap request or 'offer' on the DEX’s order book, while participants (aka 'bidders') take a look at the order book, locate an offer that interests them, and initiate a swap. This process mirrors the maker-taker system of traditional centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.</p><p>However, this user experience isn't inherently part of atomic swap technology, as we've outlined in <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before\">this blog post</a></strong>, but is facilitated by Particl's unique SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a decentralized, privacy-first messaging network, also known as 'mixnets' (see <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\">this article</a></strong> for more information on SMSG).</p><p>The SMSG network serves as a powerful tool and a crucial component in making BasicSwap DEX a user-centric platform. Turns out, it also ultimately became the key to implementing bidirectional Monero atomic swaps.</p><h2 id=\"simulating-offers-requesting-monero\">Simulating Offers Requesting Monero</h2><p>Our solution to the unidirectionality of Monero atomic swaps doesn't hinge on modifying the Monero codebase or its adaptor signature atomic swap protocol. Instead, it leverages the SMSG network to simulate offers featuring Monero.</p><p>In reality, BasicSwap still employs the same semi-scriptless adaptor signature protocol. Hence, at the protocol level, the swaps remain unidirectional. However, by integrating an additional automated step into the swap process — powered by the SMSG network — we've made it appear as if Monero can now be offered.</p><p>Even though it is fundamentally a clever workaround — essentially providing the illusion of a truly bidirectional swap — it is entirely seamless for the end user and doesn't necessitate any additional manual input or requirements.</p><p>Refer to the original adaptor signature atomic swap flow chart provided earlier in this article. Now, compare it to this flow chart displaying the process of executing a 'reverse Monero atomic swap' using adaptor signatures on BasicSwap DEX, again from the perspective of the offerer.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2023/08/image-3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2023/08/image-3.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2023/08/image-3.png 1000w, /glink/2023/08/image-3.png 1272w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption><em><strong>See reversed flowchart from the bidder's perspective: </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.rev.bidder.xu.min.svg\">https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.rev.bidder.xu.min.svg</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>From this, it's clear that the base protocol stays the same, but there are a few more steps and processing involved — all occurring in the background without necessitating further human intervention.</p><p>Indeed, whereas a PART (or BTC) to XMR swap would send a bid, a XMR to PART swap instead sends a 'bid request' that has to be accepted by the bidder.

As evidenced by the removal of the cryptocurrency from numerous centralized exchanges such as Binance, the accessibility of Monero has significantly dwindled for many individuals worldwide, even though it remains legal. The rate at which these measures are being enforced is only likely to speed up over time.</p><p>Furthermore, increasingly complicated regulations targeting custodial cryptocurrency businesses (referred to as \"MSB\") are being enshrined in law or, at the very least, being seriously considered by several governments across the world, highlighting a dire need for more self-custodial solutions such as BasicSwap DEX. As these circumstances evolve, it becomes increasingly clear that cryptocurrencies like Monero and <strong>truly decentralized and self-custodial solutions</strong> like BasicSwap DEX, which have remained compliant with the various global regulations, are needed.</p><h2 id=\"decentralized-trading-exchanges-the-ultimate-refuge\">Decentralized Trading Exchanges: The Ultimate Refuge</h2><p>Fortunately, truly decentralized trading exchanges (DEXs), which operate entirely without any central component or service provider, are still allowed and serve as safe haven in the preservation of crypto's root values. Monero's widespread availability on these platforms is critical not only for its survival, but also for the preservation of our human rights.</p><p>However, the absence of programmable outputs in Monero has been a long-standing challenge when integrating them into these platforms. This situation has resulted in Monero having one of the lowest presences amongst popular cryptocurrencies on such decentralized exchanges. The arrival of adaptor signature-based atomic swaps initiated a change, but until now, the inability to execute bidirectional atomic swaps posed an understandable but significant barrier to the Monero community's extensive use of atomic swaps.</p><p>The integration of bidirectional Monero atomic swaps into the BasicSwap DEX marks a shift in this scenario, reinforcing our conviction in the significance of today's announcement.</p><h2 id=\"the-road-ahead\">The Road Ahead</h2><p>Of course, there’s a lot of work that still needs to be done. For instance, BasicSwap, operating as a local application hosting various blockchains, remains relatively complex to initiate. Even though we've streamlined the setup process with the soon-to-come release of an executable (.exe) installer and launcher, the resultant user experience still falls short when compared to centralized exchanges — although, once set up, it operates in remarkably similar ways.</p><p>This fact underscores our recent emphasis on developing a web framework that will equip BasicSwap to deliver web services and power decentralized trading platforms on the web.

Contribute to\ntecnovert/basicswap development by creating an account on GitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commits/dev]We've also implemented a few\nminor modifications, notably enhancing the information display during adaptor\nsignature-based swaps. The ITX and PTX states, which previously appeared as\n\"Unknown\", are now accurately displayed. \n\nThis improvement has now been pushed to BasicSwap's dev branch, with additional\nupdates to follow soon, and will soon transition to the master branch, making\nthe update official.\n\nIncreased Focus on New Exchange Listing ?\nThis week, we've been asked about the current efforts to get PART listed in new\nexchanges, and we thought of addressing that in this update.\n\nIn light of Bittrex's current situation, which is less than ideal for many\ncommunity members, we've indeed recently increased our efforts to secure\nlistings on more accessible and popular exchanges.\n\nThe objectives of this initiative are multifaceted. Firstly, we aim to enhance\nthe accessibility of PART for both our community and newcomers. This involves\nideally listing on a KYC-free, unrestricted exchange that operates in a broad\nrange of countries.\n\nSecondly, we seek to establish a reputable trading environment for the PART\ncoin, which will foster improved liquidity and increased volume. This, in turn,\nwill enhance the coin's appeal to external observers and speculators.\n\nAdditionally, securing listings for PART on more popular and widely used\nexchanges paves the way for the coin to be reintroduced to quick swap exchanges\nlike SimpleSwap.io and StealthEX.io. As you may recall, PART was previously\nlisted on these exchanges but was removed when Bittrex began restricting their\nAPI use to service providers.\n\nIn essence, securing listings on better and more widely used exchanges will\nyield net positive outcomes for the project, amplifying the results of our\nmarketing and outreach efforts. While most exchanges enforce NDAs during the\ndiscussion and negotication phase, thus limiting our ability to share ongoing\ndevelopments, we will certainly announce any positive news in that regard as\nsoon as we are able to.\n\nNew Particl Website ✅\nWe're still making good progress on the new website, which we now expect to have\na working version in internal testing in the next couple of days.

This capability, which is absent in all other Monero atomic swap\nimplementations in the field, sets BasicSwap even further apart from other DEX\nsolutions in offering a ready-made, all-inclusive, and unapologetically\ndecentralized swapping solution for Monero.\n\nWe're now thoroughly testing this new capability against various edge cases,\nfocusing particularly on all potential 'unhappy paths' or scenarios when a swap\nmay not go as planned. We anticipate that this exciting new feature will be live\nvery soon, so keep your eyes peeled for an update!\n\nThe addition of bi-directional Monero swaps marks a significant stride towards\nour vision of a privacy-first, pro-liberty economy that's inclusive of many\nprivacy coins, and we're thrilled for BasicSwap to play a pivotal role in\nfurthering this mission.\n\nFor a bit more technical information on bi-directional Monero swaps, you can\nconsult this WIP documentation\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/dev/doc/protocols/adaptor_sig_reversed.md] \nor these visual graphics (1\n[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tecnovert/basicswap/be46d8a7bd1c6528f4c234668c9902b220ac2327/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.rev.bidder.xu.min.svg]\n, 2\n[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tecnovert/basicswap/be46d8a7bd1c6528f4c234668c9902b220ac2327/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.rev.offerer.xu.min.svg]\n).\n\n> Note: This improvement requires no UI modifications; the process for placing\norders that request Monero will mirror that of offering it, but in reverse.\nNew Particl Website ✅\nAfter the release of BasicSwap's GUI 2.0.2 last week, we have redirected more\nresources towards the development of the new website.

This release contains a\nmultitude of enhancements, additions, and fixes, a significant portion of which\ncame directly from community feedback. \n\nHere is a comprehensive breakdown of the modifications introduced by this\nupdate.\n\n * Extensive enhancements to the Wallets page including an alternate display of\n   asset values in USD and BTC, improved visualization of pending balances, and\n   more accurate button labeling.\n * The order book now offers a display of rates and amounts in USD for a more\n   intuitive user experience, and also remembers your most recent filter\n   history.\n * Tooltips have been added across various locations to better explain certain\n   features.\n * New \"Accept\" button in the \"Available Bids\" section and a \"Details\" button in\n   \"Bids Received\"/\"Bids Sent\" sections for improved navigation.\n * Users now have the ability to prune offer, bid, and swap history from the\n   user interface, enabling a cleaner workspace.\n * The management of SMSG addresses has been significantly improved for better\n   user control.\n * A range of back-end improvements have been made, including code clean-ups,\n   upgraded icons, and overall GUI enhancements for a smoother user experience.\n\nNow that this update is live, our next objective, on the desktop UI front, is to\noverhaul the DEX's 'New Offer' page. This revamp will be included in our\nforthcoming GUI update, specifically version 2.0.3.\n\nBi-directional Monero Swaps ?\nWe've once again made substantial strides towards the integration of\nbi-directional Monero atomic swaps into the BasicSwap DEX, although there is\nstill no code officially merged on Github yet.\n\nWhile progress towards completion of this important feature is satisfying,\nadditional work and thorough testing are still needed before it is fully ready\nfor deployment.

Members can now test the wizard and provide feedback on any potential\nissues specific to their operating systems.\n\nAs we finalize the minor details for it, our next step will be to compile it\ninto an .exe launcher for Windows, along with equivalent launchers for other\noperating systems. It's important to note that the initial wizard release will\nnot include an .exe launcher to start BasicSwap after it is installed. However,\nthe inclusion of this feature is planned for a subsequent release.\n\nUser Interface ?️ \nWe've successfully resolved the majority of the bugs present in version 2.0.2 of\nthe user interface and are currently incorporating a few final additions based\non community feedback. Once these changes are implemented, we'll be ready for\nthe official release.\n\nAs highlighted in last week's report, the 2.0.2 user interface and the new setup\nwizard will be launched simultaneously.\n\nCodebase ?\nThose familiar with BasicSwap may be aware that the integration of Monero is\ncurrently partial. As it stands, you can't place offers on the order book\noffering Monero in exchange for other coins. If you possess Monero and want to\nswap it for another currency, you must choose an offer made by another user\nrequesting Monero. That's why the Monero integration may sometimes be referred\nto as working \"one way\".\n\nThis situation is a result of an inherent limitation within Monero's coin\nstructure and its adaptor signature-based swap protocol. However, we're excited\nto announce that we have begun the process of implementing our solution to this\nissue this week, ahead of our presentation at Monerokon. The fix won't be at the\nprotocol level, rather leveraging SMSG and BasicSwap's order book system.\nHowever, from the perspective of the end-user, the outcome will be seamless,\nallowing them to finally swap Monero \"both ways\" — that is, to publish offers on\nthe order book that both offer and request Monero.\n\nWhile we would greatly like to have a basic demo of our solution available by\nnext Friday, when Particl and BasicSwap developer Kewde is scheduled to present\nat Monerokon, we can't make any firm guarantee in that regard. For the time\nbeing, know that we're diligently working to make it a reality, and that we'll\nkeep you up-to-date about progress on that end.\n\nBasicSwap Presenting at Monerokon ?\nA technical conference in privacy and financial technologyA technical\nconference\nin privacy and financial technologyKonferenco2023 [https://monerokon.com/]We are\nthrilled to announce our invitation to deliver a presentation at this year's\nMonerokon conference.

Therefore, we've opted to hold the\nrelease of the v2.0.2 GUI until the setup wizard is ready.\n\nSimultaneously, we have identified and are addressing a few GUI bugs within the\n2.0.2 version of the BasicSwap user interface, and so we're fixing those at the\nsame time.\n\nCodebase ?\nWe've been adding some functions based on user feedback, notably the ability to\nprune data off of your local instance.

If an instance were to be scrutinized after data\ndeletion, remnants of previous swaps may still be detected. We plan to introduce\nthorough data pruning in a privacy-conscious manner in the future, as this\nrequires additional development.\n\nFurthermore, we've upgraded the core versions of the Particl and Monero\nblockchains.

liquidity-providing\nscript for BasicSwap DEX. This user-friendly script enables you to offer\nliquidity for your preferred trading pairs and set a markup above or below the\nmarket price that lets you benefit from arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFurthermore, the script is designed to automatically republish your offers when\nthey expire, adhering to your predefined pricing strategy. This ensures that\nyour offers consistently reflect the current market rate, plus any additional\npremium you have chosen to apply.\n\n> Note: While this is currently made available as a companion script, we\nanticipate that many of its features will eventually be integrated into\nBasicSwap's core functionality.\nHow to Get Started\nTo get started, simply update your BasicSwap DEX instance. The script is\nincluded in the basicswap/scripts folder.\n\n * How to update BasicSwap DEX (Academy): \n   https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html\n * How to update BasicSwap DEX (Youtube): https://youtu.be/kk3FtE_TKBQ\n\nTo run the script, you’ll need to first edit the JSON template configuration\nfile (template_createoffers.json) included with the update to your liking, then\nrename it to createoffers.json. You can find the instructions on how to properly\nedit that file, as well as all possible variables, here\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_liquidity_bot.html] \non the Particl Academy.\n\nBasicSwap DEX Liquidity Tools Guide — Particl Academy latest documentationLearn\nhow to use the liquidity tools available for the BasicSwap DEX\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_liquidity_bot.html]\nOnce that’s done, simply run the script with the command python createoffers.py. \n\n> Note: The script needs to run continuously to be take effect.

that has been made in\nthe past few days. Let us take a moment to evaluate the advancements achieved in\nthe past few days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nEarlier in the week, we pushed the new version of Particl Core to Particl\nDesktop, meaning that your client will now automatically download the most\nrecent version the next time you launch it.\n\nIf your Particl Desktop is currently running, you can trigger the update by\nshutting it down and launching it again.\n\nOther than that, we're still completing the items outlined in our previous\nupdates, namely including enhancing Tor server capabilities and making a variety\nof minor improvements.\n\nPlease note, however, that we are currently observing a delay in the development\nprocess of Particl Desktop which we hope to resolve shortly.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nCommits · tecnovert/basicswapBasic Atomic Swap Proof of Concept. Contribute to\ntecnovert/basicswap development by creating an account on GitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commits/master]Early in the week, we\nidentified a rare scenario where a malicious user could manipulate the protocol\nto abandon swaps mid-process. While this situation doesn't pose a risk of loss\nof funds, it could adversely affect user experience by leading participants into\nswaps destined to fail. We have promptly fixed this issue.\n\nYou can find the fix, as well as other updates to the BasicSwap protocol,\ndirectly on its Github page here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commits/master].\n\nUser Interface ?️\nWe've made several improvements and tweaks to the user interface, thanks to\nvaluable community feedback, which are ready to go live any day from now. While\nthe merge still hasn't happened, you can expect GUI v2.0.2 to be deployed\nsomewhere next week.\n\nHere are a few notable improvements featured in v2.0.2:\n\n * Enhanced display and usage of swap rates.\n * Tooltips when hovering over specific areas.\n * Enhanced bid-related pages, including the addition of a button to open swap\n   details as opposed to clicking on the bid's hash, improved display of bid and\n   swap statuses, and more.\n * Persistent filters in the order book and bid/offer pages.\n * Improved information display in the \"Create New Offer\" page.\n\nThese updates aim to create a more intuitive and user-friendly interface. Stay\ntuned for the launch!\n\nCoin Integrations ?\nWe are currently exploring the possibility of introducing new coins to BasicSwap\nin the near future. This initiative is a follow-up to some of our discussions at\nMonerotopia, where we connected with several teams and individuals about\nintegrating their coin or protocol into BasicSwap.\n\nHowever, as each coin integration requires individual attention and can be\ntime-consuming and resource-intensive for all parties involved, we cannot\nprovide specific timelines or commitments at this stage.\n\nAs always, we will take care of informing you as soon as new coins are ready for\ndeployment.\n\nWeb Framework ?\nWe are currently developing a web framework intended to make BasicSwap\naccessible via the web. This is a complex task, as the DEX must be largely\nre-imagined and rebuilt to offer a fitting web experience.\n\nThe deployment of such a platform presents various challenges, both technical\nand user-experience related, that makes it architecturally more intricate, but\nalso more accessible to the end-user, than a local installation.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example, the first iteration of a web version of the\nDEX is designed to be more of a quick exchange platform, similar to the\nExodus/SimpleSwap flow type. Our goal is to avoid requiring users to deposit any\ncoins into a persistent web wallet, enhancing both security and usability.\nHowever, due to the nature of atomic swaps, this approach necessitates that swap\ncontracts be pre-signed and that users send coins directly into these contracts.\nThis represents a completely different approach and a more complex flow compared\nto BasicSwap's current local architecture, but it also opens the door to\nfeatures not readily available on a local installation.\n\nFor this reason, we anticipate that the local and web versions of BasicSwap will\ndiverge significantly, each presenting unique advantages, trade-offs, and\nspecific feature sets. This expanded choice aligns with Particl's mission by\nenhancing user flexibility, enabling them to select the platform that most\nclosely aligns with their needs without forcing compromises on the BasicSwap DEX\nprotocol itself. It's the best of both worlds!\n\nTaking all of that into consideration, developing this web framework will take\nconsiderable time, owing to both its development requirements and the need for\nrigourous testing before deployment. \n\nAt the moment, Particl developers Kewde and Tecnovert are working on this task.\nUpdates on its progress may not be regular, but it is now a major focus moving\nforward, so we will ensure you are informed when significant milestones are\nachieved. Your patience and support in this initiative are greatly appreciated;\nwe are convinced that this is a major part of what needs to happen for BasicSwap\nto take off as an end-user product.\n\nUpcoming Overhaul of Particl.io ?\nAs noted in some of our previous progress updates, we're also working on a new\nversion of the Particl.io website. \n\nWhile we continue to focus on various aspects of the project at the same time,\nwe're still making consistent progress towards getting the new website ready for\nlaunch. \n\nWe expect the revamped website to be ready for deployment relatively soon,\nalthough it is still a bit too early to commit to more precise timelines. So\nstay tuned for further updates on that front!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
