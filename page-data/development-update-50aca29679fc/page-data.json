The first category, Global Settings, are\nclient-wide settings that regulate the entire Particl Desktop client. These\nsettings are effective for all wallets and contain options like enable UPnP,\nconnect clients via proxy, or choose the client’s language (for those who prefer\ntheir client not to display text in English).\n\nThe second type of settings, Wallet Settings, are parameters that are effective\nonly within the specific wallet on which they have been set up. What it means is\nthat when changing preferences within the Wallet Settings page, the changes only\napply to the wallet you’re currently in. Changes will not affect other wallets\nand each one can have its independent parameters. An example of wallet-specific\nsettings would be Notifications Settings, where you can specify what you want to\nbe notified of (payment received, pending orders, staking rewards, new\nproposals, etc).\n\nAs it stands today, all the technical changes that were required for the Global\nSettings are now completed. The team is now busy with tweaking the GUI/front-end\nto display the new changes correctly and to easily allow for the updating of\nthese parameters as well as the addition of new options, in the future.\n\nOpen Marketplace\nThe Open Marketplace is Particl’s first official Dapp. It is a decentralized and\nprivate-by-default marketplace where anyone can buy and sell stuff for crypto at\nnear-zero cost and without leaving a trace.\n\nMarket Management\nRead More: Market Management Tool\n[https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b#7168]\nThe lowest hanging fruit for improving Particl's user experience is by making\nseveral tweaks to the user interface of…\n[https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b#7168]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b#7168]\n\nMarket Management is the Open Marketplace’s tool which allows anyone to create a\nshop or a personal market. This is a key component for the Open Marketplace and\nwill be a cornerstone for its adoption as it will allow more customization and\ntools for sellers (i.e. promoting listings, shops, or markets).\n\nAt this moment, the development team is working on the creation and integration\nof seller profiles. Seller profiles are a major addition coming along with\nMarket Management. They allow users to create “profiles” for each wallet. Each\nprofile has its very own “identity” and the client will offer a lot of options\nto manage profiles (i.e. a profile can be manually selected, per wallet, and can\nalso be associated with multiple markets at once). To better understand the\ndistinction between Markets, Profiles, and Identities, as introduced by the\nMarket Management tool, there’s no better explanation than the image below that\nwas put together by Juha Kovanen [https://github.com/xludx], Lead Open\nMarketplace Developer.\n\nA breakdown of Profiles, Markets, and IdentitiesAdditionally, because the Market\nManagement tool is such a big feature, and because it touches most of the Open\nMarketplace’s components, the team’s going through a significant marketplace\nrefactoring process so that the new changes can seamlessly be integrated.\n\nMystery Feature (Will be Revealed at SFBW)\nThe team has been quietly working on a secret feature which will be a major\ndriver to adoption. This feature will only be revealed on Friday the 1st of\nNovember at 11:30 am at SFBW’s Epicenter during Dr. Kapil Amarasinghe’s talk. Of\ncourse, it will be mentioned at the conferences, even before the speech, so if\nyou’re coming to SFBW or are in Vegas, you might get an exclusive scoop! This\nfeature will be a major driver to adoption for the Particl Open Marketplace and\nhas been a long-awaited addition.\n\nThe back-end code for this feature is now almost complete, with the front-end\nintegration beginning this week, if all goes well. Particl’s development team\nplans on starting the internal testing by the end of the week. While it’s likely\nthat the feature won’t be ready for release during SFBW, it will still be\nannounced regardless, even if that means that it will be released a short time\nafter the conference.\n\nOnce the feature is announced, a blog post will be published on Particl.news\nwith all the details!\n\nParticl Core\nParticl Core is the underlying blockchain protocol on which the Particl\necosystem runs.\n\nParticl’s Lightning Network\nParticl Lightning Network Now Available on Testnet\n[https://particl.news/particl-lightning-network-now-available-on-testnet-eb87a5ab65cd]\n⚡️First Testnet Particl LND Transaction Successful⚡️ Last week, Particl's Core\nDeveloper and Cryptographer, Tecnovert …\n[https://particl.news/particl-lightning-network-now-available-on-testnet-eb87a5ab65cd]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-lightning-network-now-available-on-testnet-eb87a5ab65cd]\n\nTo make sure the Particl network can handle as many transactions as possible,\nParticl’s Lead Core Developer and Cryptographer, Tecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert], has re-enabled Bitcoin-style Segwit scripts\ncompatibility with Particl Core and reverted Particl’s Lightning Network to a\nsimpler implementation that’s closer to Bitcoin’s. This will allow for a much\nsimpler implementation of Particl’s Lightning Network on mainnet and also make\nPART easier to integrate to PSBT hardware wallets\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0174.mediawiki].\n\nWhile it’s probably going to be some time until the Lightning Network is\nrequired for Particl to handle more transactions on its network (it’s estimated\nthat the Particl network can do about 70–80 public transactions per second),\nthis is a good pre-emptive measure to ensure that the protocol is ready as soon\nas it needs to be used.\n\nIt’s important to note that the Lightning Network can be used for more than just\nscaling a blockchain network. It can, for example, be used to facilitate and\nimprove the performance of atomic swaps or conduct swaps directly on LND,\nwithout even using atomic swaps. It is expected that LND will be used, in the\nfuture, to facilitate PART swaps.\n\nParticl Core 0.19.0.1 RC1 Pre-Released\nAlways with keeping with the latest Bitcoin Core development in mind, Particl\nCore 0.19.0.1 RC1\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1rc1] has been\npre-released on testnet and mainnet. While this isn’t particularly the biggest\nor most exciting update of Particl Core ever, it is important to keep these\nupdates coming as it makes sure Particl’s version doesn’t drift away from the\n“mother code”.\n\nIn reality, the longer you wait to update a Bitcoin-based codebase to Bitcoin’s\nlatest version, the more complicated and time-consuming it gets to update it\nlater. Additionally, it ensures that the chain benefits from all the same\nusability, performance, and security updates that Bitcoin gets.\n\nIf you feel like helping out, you can download Particl Core 0.19.0.1 RC1\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1rc1] today and\nreport any bug you find on Github, that is, if you find any, of course!

Initially mentioned\n[https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190359593550901248] last Friday by\nDr. Kapil Amarasinghe during his 30-minute talk at SFBW’s Epicenter\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZAmMXEvkPc], this new payment option will\nallow users to easily use Bitcoin as a form of payment on the Open Marketplace.\nThis news is directly in line with Particl’s current focus on adoption (in this\nparticular case, focused on the cryptocurrency crowd) and makes the Open\nMarketplace more accessible than ever, especially to people not currently part\nof the Particl community.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBitcoin Payment Integration\nHow the integration of this new feature will look like is as a separate,\nstandalone BTC-PART exchange module within Particl Desktop. The module will\ninteract with the checkout process but will not be directly integrated as part\nof the full buy flow. It will instead be displayed as a separate page within\nParticl Desktop.\n\nThe reason for this is simple — once BTC is transferred for PART, the received\nPART is always, at least initially, received on a public balance. As you\nprobably already know, the Open Marketplace funds stored on anon balances to be\nable to purchase products and services. And because converting funds from a\npublic balance to an anon one takes 12 confirmations, on top of which more\nconfirmations are added as a result of the exchange’s own confirmations\n(incoming Bitcoin confirmations, for example), the integration, as it currently\nstands, cannot be integrated as a core component of the buy flow in a\nuser-friendly and practical way.\n\nExchange Module…as a Separate Page\nWIP, Interface Subject to Change (Testnet Only Shows PART to PART Exchange, BTC\non Mainnet Only)How the integration of this BTC-PART module will look like is a\nsimple and convenient Exchange accessible right from the left sidebar of Particl\nDesktop! If you recall, on Particl Desktop, the Wallet section of the menu\ncurrently has these four pages: Send/Convert, Receive, History, and Address\nBook. This update will introduce fifth section, Exchange, to the Wallet section\nof the sidebar. This page will also be accessible from any regular wallet,\nmeaning the exchange feature won’t need to be manually activated by the user.\n\nPutting the Exchange page as a standalone page on any type of wallet means\nBitcoin users will be able to fund their wallets with PART using Bitcoin,\nallowing them to use any of the Particl Desktop features that requires a fee to\nbe paid (privacy transaction, community proposals, flagging items, etc).\n\nExchange Module…as Part of the Checkout Process\nWhile the exchange module will be a standalone application, at least for the\nforeseeable future, it will still be integrated into the checkout process and\ninteract with it. The process is simple — simply go through the same process of\npurchasing an item to your cart as you always do. Add an item to your cart,\nconfirm the cart’s content, enter your shipping information, and then land on\nthe order confirmation page. Right at that moment, you will be met with two\nbuttons — one to confirm your order, and the other to be redirected to the\nexchange module. If you do not have enough funds to place your order, then the\n“Confirm Order” button will be greyed out while the Exchange button will\nredirect you to the exchange module.\n\nOnce there, the module will automatically fill up the number of PART necessary\nto pay for your order and tell you exactly how many BTC are required to acquire\nthat many PART coins. You will then be able to send Bitcoin to the exchange\nmodule and receive PART in exchange. Once the exchange is completed, you’ll be\nable to easily come back to the confirmation section of the checkout process and\nsuccessfully place your order.\n\nSo while Bitcoin won’t directly be a “payment option” per se, the exchange\nmodule will still interact with your cart in a way that makes it easier and\nuser-friendly for everyone to get the right amount of PART using BTC.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThis BTC-PART exchange module will not be using atomic swaps of any sort of\ndecentralized exchange method, at least not for its initial integration.\nInstead, it will be plugged into a non-custodial exchange that doesn’t require\nKYC or personal information —SimpleSwap [https://simpleswap.io/].\n\nWIP, Interface Subject to Change (Testnet Only Shows PART to PART Exchange, BTC\non Mainnet Only)The module uses SMSG to relay messages between Particl and the\nSimpleSwap engine. The key part to understand is that this exchange module has\nbeen built using SMSG in a very generic matter, and it could eventually be used\nas the base layers to deploy all sorts of services on Particl (i.e. price\npegging, chat module, etc). This module is likely to be included in the incoming\nParticl SDK which is probably going to see the day somewhere in 2020.\n\nA “per transaction” limit function has also been integrated into the module as\nwell, making sure users exchange a number of coins that’s in between the minimum\nand maximum range allowed by the exchange. Most of the information that is\nusually displayed when making a transaction on [https://simpleswap.io/]\nSimpleSwap [https://simpleswap.io/] will also all be displayed right from\nParticl Desktop.\n\nAdditionally, the exchange module will also include an “auto-anonymizer” feature\nwhich will allow you to automatically receive your PART on anon balances. This\nadditional privacy feature included in Particl Desktop’s exchange module isn’t\navailable when simply going on [https://simpleswap.io/]SimpleSwap\n[https://simpleswap.io/]’s website. That RingCT exchange perk feature may, or\nmay not, be part of the first iteration of the exchange module, but it is\nalready in development and should follow very shortly after the first release if\nnot immediately ready. Fingers crossed!\n\nFinally, the exchange module is not designed or hardcoded to work only using \n[https://simpleswap.io/]SimpleSwap [https://simpleswap.io/]. That particualr\nexchange was chosen as the initial service provider because of the lack of KYC\nrequirements and the relatively low friction involved in trades. Should new\nexchanges that provide similar benefits list PART, they could be added to the\nmodule, giving users even more options.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll About Adoption and Speed\nThis integration of a BTC-PART payment module is directly in line with the\nteam’s current focus on eliminating the barriers to entry and kickstarting the\nadoption of the Particl network. It significantly increases the potential amount\nof users that can use the Particl ecosystem and makes getting PART as easy as it\nhas ever been.\n\nWIP, Interface Subject to Change (Testnet Only Shows PART to PART Exchange, BTC\non Mainnet Only)While the feature itself is not entirely ready as of the time of\nthis writing, the team has completed the back-end code as well as the testing\nand is currently finalizing the GUI integration. That should be completed within\na few days, and then more testing will be required to make sure its integration\ninto Particl Desktop hasn’t highlighted any new issue. While a definitive\nrelease date cannot be committed to at this moment, we are getting pretty close\nfor the feature to be fully ready. The exchange module will be released as part\nof Particl Desktop 2.3.0.\n\nNote: Particl Desktop 2.2.0 is currently being tested on testnet and should be\nreleased within just a few days. Aside from the new Global Settings feature, it\nwill mostly include bug fixes, flow optimizations, and UI/UX improvements.\nParticl Desktop 2.2.0 and Particl Desktop 2.3.0 are estimated to be released in\nvery close proximity.\n\nThe Pieces are Falling Into Place\nThe Particl team is full steam ahead and working tirelessly on kickstarting the\nadoption of the Particl platform. Stay alert as you can expect some exciting\nnews to be published soon on Particl.news. Suffice to say, the future of Particl\nis looking brighter every day as the pieces of the puzzle are starting to fall\ninto place at a very interesting pace.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Announces-Bitcoin-Exchange-Integration-Into-Particl-Desktop/1-kqXnceUmmgRlUGrFYGulPw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Announces-Bitcoin-Exchange-Integration-Into-Particl-Desktop/1-SvvDdJMh8rUGGY0sr516iQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>WIP, Interface Subject to Change (Testnet Only Shows PART to PART Exchange, BTC on Mainnet Only)</figcaption></figure><p>Today we’re excited to officially announce more details about Particl’s integration of a Bitcoin exchange module into the Particl Desktop client.

Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
