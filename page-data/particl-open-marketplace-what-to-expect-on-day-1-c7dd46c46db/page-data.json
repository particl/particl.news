After years of research, development, fine-tuning, refactoring, and\ncommunity-testing, it is finally ready to be unveiled as the world’s most\ndisruptive and empowering marketplace the world has ever seen.\n\nWhat’s Particl and What’s the Open Marketplace?\nParticl is an entirely decentralized platform. There is no third-party or\nintermediary operating it or having any sort of control over its network. It\nuses a mix of P2P and blockchain technologies, meaning that it is exclusively\nrun by its global community of users.\n\nThe Open Marketplace is an equally decentralized application that’s built on top\nof the Particl network. It allows anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and\nservices, physical or digital, regardless of where they are located in the\nworld. And because it is entirely decentralized, there’s no staff or support\nteam to enforce rules and policies.\n\nFurthermore, the Open Marketplace is completely private by default, meaning no\nidentifiable data can be linked to any of its users. Transactions are hidden on\nthe blockchain, images are stripped of their metadata, data exchange is\nencrypted, and you can even connect the marketplace through the Tor network. In\nother words, users of the marketplace are anonymous.\n\nWhat’s important to note, though, is that the Open Marketplace is still very\ndeep into its development phase. In fact, this mainnet release will mark the\nbeginning of the Beta phase of development. Whereas the Alpha phase was mostly\nfocused on building the base layer of the marketplace, Beta will be about adding\nvarious features on top of it and make it more appealing and easy to use for\nvarious types of vendors and buyers.\n\nSo what does it mean? What will you be able to do with Particl’s Open\nMarketplace once it first comes out? What are going to be the available\nfeatures? This blog post will explain, in details, everything you need to know\nprior to the marketplace releasing on mainnet.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSlick, Modern, and User-Friendly Interface\nOne of the most important aspect of any marketplace or product is the user\ninterface and how easy and seamless it is to use. No matter how many great\nfeatures a marketplace has, consumers will opt for a simpler option if it is too\ndifficult use or too time-consuming to learn.\n\nAnd so, with this in mind, the Particl team has put tremendous focus on the Open\nMarketplace’s user experience and interface. In fact, the marketplace is\nintegrated directly into Particl Desktop, the network’s flagship client, and is\ndesigned in a way that makes it easy for everyone to quickly understand how it\nworks. Forget the usual boring and ugly look of cryptocurrency wallets — the\nOpen Marketplace is not only very pleasant to the eye, it is also a very\nintuitive platform that won’t require you to pull all of the hair out of your\nhead just to figure out how to make it work.\n\nYes, this first version mainnet of the marketplace is a Beta build. Yes, there\nare definitely a lot of improvements that are going to be made so that it can be\n“grandma-friendly”, but as Particl always strives to improve its products on all\naspects, and as UI/UX is one of the top focus of the team, it will keep getting\nbetter and more intuitive over time. According to today’s crypto standards,\nParticl Desktop is damn sexy, but the team’s target is set much higher than just\nbeing “good enough” for the crypto crowd.\n\nBuy Stuff for Crypto\n * No fee\n * No identifiable data generated or collected by any 3rd-party\n * No registration or account creation\n * Full escrow support\n * Untraceable currency transactions\n\nIt is already possible to buy many things with cryptocurrencies, but most\noptions are full of friction and they introduce third-parties back in the game.\nThese options either require you to (1) pay a hefty fee, (2) go through many\nsteps and account registrations, or (3) sacrifice your personal data to some\ncompany.\n\nIn most cases, these options introduce all of the above mentioned issues. In all\ncases, the re-introduction of third-parties into the process is proving to be\nhighly counter-productive and more troublesome than simply spending traditional\ncurrencies. Didn’t we start using Bitcoin because we wanted to get rid of\nmiddlemen? Then, why should we have to crawl back to them when we want to spend\nour coins?\n\nParticl fixes all of that in one big swoop by providing a private-by-default\nmarketplace that allows anyone to safely buy products and services online and\npay for them using cryptocurrencies, but without having to deal with any of the\nthree issues introduced by third-parties mentioned just above. After all,\nBitcoin was initially created to be an ecosystem that’s entirely independent\nfrom third-parties, as demonstrated by Satoshi’s early attempt at building a\ndecentralized marketplace on top of the Bitcoin codebase\n[https://news.bitcoin.com/satoshis-pre-release-bitcoin-code-contains-some-fascinating-findings/]\n.\n\nThe Open Marketplace is entirely decentralized and autonomous, meaning it\ndoesn’t rely on any third-party to operate. The absence of any third-party means\nthat you do not have to pay any fee or sacrifice your personal data in order to\nbe able to use cryptocurrencies as actual currencies.\n\nFor the buyer, that means you will likely get access to more affordable products\nsince vendors do not need to pay any fee, except for a small anti-spam listing\nfee. Keep in mind that some online vendors need to pay as high as 40% fee per\nsale, once every fee is paid. Sometimes, that’s even more. That is always\nreflected in the final price that we all pay when shopping online.\n\nSave time and energy by instantly and directly connecting with vendors that\nalready accept cryptocurrencies. Gone are the days you needed to continually\nbrowse the internet to find a vendor that sells the product you are looking\nfor…and accepts cryptocurrencies at the same time.\n\nSell Stuff for Crypto\n * No fee, except for a small listing fee of a few cents\n * No identifiable data generated or collected by any 3rd-party\n * No registration or account creation\n * Full escrow support\n * Untraceable currency transactions\n\nNow, what if you would like to sell some stuff and accept cryptocurrencies? What\nif you wanted to make a business out of it? There are a few options available,\nbut just like for buyers, they require the assistance of third-parties to\nfunction. This introduces a lot of issues for vendors such as (1) paying very\nhigh fees, (2) requiring a lot of paperwork and sign ups, and (3) sacrificing\nyour business data to some company.\n\nThanks to its decentralized structure, the Open Marketplace fixes the issues\nmentioned above by allowing sellers to earn cryptocurrencies by putting products\nand services up for sale on the platform, but without using of any third-party\nor company. The only fee sellers are required to pay, aside from the usual\ncryptocurrency transaction fee, is a small anti-spam listing fee of a few cents\nper day. Everything else is at a big fat 0% fee. For most people selling online,\nthis is about as big of as deal as it gets!\n\nImagine you’re a seller and paying something like 40% fee per transaction, or\neven “just” 15%. Suddenly being charged ~0% on your sales represents a huge\nopportunity and can change your business around in a major way. Not only can you\nmake much more profit per sale, but you can also reduce your prices to gain a\nnet advantage over your competitors.\n\nAnd, since the Open Marketplace is a crypto-focused two-sided marketplace,\nmeaning the platform is populated by both active sellers and buyers, it is the\nideal place to sell items for cryptocurrencies without having to waste hours\nfinding a target audience that is not only looking for your product, but also\nwilling to spend cryptocurrencies for it.\n\nDouble Deposit Escrow System\nParticl Wiki — Double Deposit Escrow System\n[https://particl.wiki/marketplace#decentralized_escrow]\nParticl's Open Marketplace is a decentralized marketplace built with privacy at\nits core. It offers a low-cost, secure…\n[https://particl.wiki/marketplace#decentralized_escrow]particl.wiki\n[https://particl.wiki/marketplace#decentralized_escrow]\n\n * No fee, except for the usual cryptocurrency transaction fee\n * Infinitely scalable\n * No identifiable data generated or collected by any 3rd-party\n * Privacy-focused\n\nUnlike other marketplaces, the Open Marketplace uses a fee-less and\ndecentralized type of escrow (or resolution center). Just like the rest of the\nplatform, this escrow system doesn’t rely on any third-party for issues to be\nresolved.\n\nIn fact, the Open Marketplace’s escrow system is based on the Mutually Assured\nDestruction (MAD) game-theory and requires both sellers and buyers to make a\nsecurity deposit, on top of the regular payment, into a smart-contract. The\nsecurity deposits are refunded, in full, to the participants when both of them\nmark the transaction as complete.\n\nNot requiring any third-party for the escrow system dramatically increases\nprivacy since no escrow agent can have access to your transaction details,\nconversation history, and tracking information. It allows you to own your data\nby ensuring that none of it can be collected by any party other than the one you\nare transacting with.\n\nParticl’s double deposit escrow system is also almost free to use. Unlike most\neCommerce platform, protecting yourself from a party you do not know or trust\nwon’t require you to pay anything other than a simple cryptocurrency transaction\nfee.\n\nAs a comparison, some marketplaces and online commerce platforms will charge you\na considerable fee, sometimes as high as 20% per transaction, just for using an\nescrow or mediation service. These fees tend to be higher on B2B-focused\nmarketplaces.\n\nTake Your Privacy Back\nParticl Explained - Private Transactions\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd]\nAnonymous transactions, or Anon transactions, as referred to in Particl\nDesktop,\ntake privacy to the next level by not…\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd]\n\n * Untraceable currency transactions\n * No metadata when uploading files (i.e. listing pictures)\n * No identifiable data generated\n * No account creation, registration, or KYC required\n * IP addresses can easily be hidden\n\nYou would think that a decentralized marketplace that doesn’t require any\nthird-party, at any step of the process, would be better at keeping your data\nprivate. That, unfortunately, couldn’t be further from the truth.\n\nIn fact, blockchains are publicly auditable ledgers that permanently record your\ndata. And while data written on a blockchain is usually pseudonymous, it is\nentirely possible to collect, analyze, decipher, and use it. Blockchain analysis\nfirms are getting exponentially better at mining and deciphering data stored on\nblockchains. Some of the largest crypto companies are even doing it out in the\nopen\n[https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/a3bn5e/coinbase-neutrino-former-hacking-team-members]\n. In other words, if you’re worried about how your data is being collected and\nused (hint: and you should be), using a public blockchain might not be ideal for\nyou.\n\nThat’s precisely why the Open Marketplace is private by default. That means you\nwon’t need to do any extra step to protect your privacy and your data won’t be\nout there on a public blockchain for everyone to see and decipher, at any point\nin time. Particl’s Open Marketplace does it all for you.\n\nBy integrating the Confidential Transactions (CT) and RingCT privacy protocols\ninto Particl’s double deposit escrow system, all currency transactions are\nhidden on the blockchain and can’t be traced back to users. Additionally, all\ndata uploaded on the marketplace is stripped of all its metadata so that it\ncan’t be reverse engineered (did you know most pictures taken by phones usually\ncontain a geo-tag?).\n\nThe only privacy enhancing feature that is not enabled by default is the Tor\nnetwork integration. While easy and very quick to set up\n[http://particl.wiki/tor-hs], it requires users to manually enable it. That’s\nbecause pushing automatic updates introduces security vulnerabilities,\nespecially man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.\n\nDecentralized Marketplace Moderation\nParticl Explained - Decentralized Marketplace Moderation\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-decentralized-marketplace-moderation-7daa3c75d5b2]\nTo vote against a specific listing, users need to flag it using the Open\nMarketplace user interface. Once the first…\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-decentralized-marketplace-moderation-7daa3c75d5b2]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-decentralized-marketplace-moderation-7daa3c75d5b2]\n\n * 1 coin = 1 vote\n * Delisting threshold is -9,000 coin weight\n * Provably verifiable\n * Cannot be gamed or produce fake votes\n * No staff with special access or power involved\n\nUsually, to keep marketplaces free of undesirable content, companies use an army\nof moderators and dedicated staff to delete listings and ban users. In the case\nof the Open Marketplace, however, that is impossible as there is no third-party\ninvolved.\n\nParticl instead built a completely decentralized governance mechanism, based on\ngame-theory, that allows anyone in the community to flag undesirable content off\nof the marketplace. The system uses a similar model as the very well known\nReddit model — any user can upvote or downvote a listing, and when it reaches a\ncertain negative threshold, that listing gets deleted from the marketplace. But\nunlike Reddit’s system, which is based on a 1 user = 1 vote basis, the Open\nMarketplace uses a 1 coin = 1 vote basis.\n\nThis system ensures that the Open Marketplace stays clean by employing what can\neffectively become the world’s largest community of moderators. It also ensures\nthat only the users of the platform have an actual say on what content gets to\nstay on there, avoiding troll armies and ill-intended individuals.\n\n> Note: On this first mainnet version of the Particl Open Marketplace, a listing\nwill get taken down entirely once it reaches a negative threshold of -9,000.\nCommunity Proposals\nDecentralized Project Governance Update\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6]\nAs we’ve highlighted in our third Community Update, the Particl team has begun\nworking on the initial version of the…\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6]\n\n * 1 coin = 1 vote\n * Anyone can submit proposals to the community\n * Anyone can vote on proposals\n\nUsing the same system that powers the decentralized moderation system, any\nParticl user can create or vote on a proposal using the Particl Desktop client.\nThis introduces a lot of opportunities for buyers, vendors, and cryptocurrency\nusers.\n\nFor example, this system could be used to reach community consensus on important\ndecisions related to the project. The community could vote on initiatives to\nfund using the common Community Fund\n[https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/address.dws?RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM.htm]\n. Vendors could also make use of this feature to poll their customer base about\nwhat type of product they should be focusing. The possibilities are endless and\nit is entirely up to the community to use the system as they please.\n\nAnd just like the decentralized moderation system, each user carries its own\nvoting weight, as determined by the number of coins they hold. This ensures only\nthose with a stake in the project can have a voice, a concept not too different\nfrom the stakeholder concept in publicly traded companies.\n\nMulti-wallets\nMulti-Wallets on Particl Desktop\n[https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076]\nMulti-wallets are not new to Particl. In fact, they have been available on\nParticl-Qt ever since Particl forked to…\n[https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076]particl.news\n[https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076]\n\nReleasing on mainnet at the same time as the Particl Open Marketplace,\nmulti-wallets allow you to manage multiple wallets within the same Particl\nDesktop environment. In this case, multi-wallets can be compared to ‘user\naccounts’ that are completely independent from each other.\n\nMulti-wallets enable a much better degree of security and privacy as each wallet\nis entirely isolated from the others. That means no information or data\n(purchases, profiles, sales data, transaction details, and etc) can leak from a\nwallet to another. It is impossible, simply by looking into the blockchain, that\ntwo wallets are hosted under the same Particl Desktop instance unless the owner\nof the two wallets has linked them together by making payments to an address\nalready identified as belonging to that user.\n\nMulti-wallets can also be used to manage various profiles on the marketplace,\nseller or buyer, and completely keep your identity private between each of the\nwallets. However, market management and market user management tools will come\nat a later time during the Beta phase of development and won’t be part of the\ninitial mainnet version of the marketplace.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith all of that being said, the Particl Open Marketplace will be the first\nprivacy-focused decentralized marketplace of its kind to ever see the day and\nwill mark an important milestone in the history of online eCommerce. It will go\nlive, on mainnet, on the 12th of August 2019 and will include all features\nmentioned in this blog post.\n\nBut don’t get too complacent, this is just the beginning of one very epic\njourney in disrupting one of the biggest sector of the global economy. This\nrelease will also mark the beginning of the Open Marketplace’s Beta phase of\ndevelopment, and it will only get more interesting and exciting from here on\nout. Moving forward, you can expect many more features to be included to it,\nmaking it a real behemoth in both the blockchain and eCommerce worlds. You can\nalso expect more users to start using it, as well as more third-party\nintegrations to see the day. Suffice to say, there’s a lot of good stuff coming\nup for Particl, and each milestone that will be reached from this point onward\nwill be more exciting than the previous one.\n\nBuckle up, because this train is finally getting moving, and there ain’t no\nstopping after it gets released out in the open!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace---What-to-Expect-on-Day-1/1-gAK1frBqYBuhi6WzZZpftg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Particl’s Open Marketplace is finally just a few days away, within an arm’s reach!

This release will also mark the beginning of the Open Marketplace’s Beta phase of development, and it will only get more interesting and exciting from here on out. Moving forward, you can expect many more features to be included to it, making it a real behemoth in both the blockchain and eCommerce worlds. You can also expect more users to start using it, as well as more third-party integrations to see the day. Suffice to say, there’s a lot of good stuff coming up for Particl, and each milestone that will be reached from this point onward will be more exciting than the previous one.</p><p>Buckle up, because this train is finally getting moving, and there ain’t no stopping after it gets released out in the open!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace---What-to-Expect-on-Day-1/1-cx5kMA6I0j5UIUCKprYfuQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure>","url":"http://localhost:2368/particl-open-marketplace-what-to-expect-on-day-1-c7dd46c46db/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"52b9ba6d-6648-44f4-b2ac-60b858d8d19a","codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5f7e4ca61a93b603e3f767bb","reading_time":11,"send_email_when_published":false,"email_subject":null,"childHtmlRehype":{"html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace---What-to-Expect-on-Day-1/1-gAK1frBqYBuhi6WzZZpftg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Particl’s Open Marketplace is finally just a few days away, within an arm’s reach! After years of research, development, fine-tuning, refactoring, and community-testing, it is finally ready to be unveiled as the world’s most disruptive and empowering marketplace the world has ever seen.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-particl-and-what-s-the-open-marketplace\">What’s Particl and What’s the Open Marketplace?</h2><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_6SvhwFYnOU?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Particl is an entirely decentralized platform. There is no third-party or intermediary operating it or having any sort of control over its network. It uses a mix of P2P and blockchain technologies, meaning that it is exclusively run by its global community of users.</p><p>The Open Marketplace is an equally decentralized application that’s built on top of the Particl network. It allows anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and services, physical or digital, regardless of where they are located in the world. And because it is entirely decentralized, there’s no staff or support team to enforce rules and policies.</p><p>Furthermore, the Open Marketplace is completely private by default, meaning no identifiable data can be linked to any of its users. Transactions are hidden on the blockchain, images are stripped of their metadata, data exchange is encrypted, and you can even connect the marketplace through the Tor network. In other words, users of the marketplace are anonymous.</p><p>What’s important to note, though, is that the Open Marketplace is still very deep into its development phase. In fact, this mainnet release will mark the beginning of the Beta phase of development. Whereas the Alpha phase was mostly focused on <strong>building the base layer of the marketplace</strong>, Beta will be about <strong>adding various features</strong> on top of it and make it more appealing and easy to use for various types of vendors and buyers.</p><p>So what does it mean? What will you be able to do with Particl’s Open Marketplace once it first comes out? What are going to be the available features? This blog post will explain, in details, everything you need to know prior to the marketplace releasing on mainnet.</p><hr><h2 id=\"slick-modern-and-user-friendly-interface\">Slick, Modern, and User-Friendly Interface</h2><p>One of the most important aspect of any marketplace or product is the user interface and how easy and seamless it is to use. No matter how many great features a marketplace has, consumers will opt for a simpler option if it is too difficult use or too time-consuming to learn.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace---What-to-Expect-on-Day-1/1-DhXEPhuXIsBc3EKOf938hg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>And so, with this in mind, the Particl team has put tremendous focus on the Open Marketplace’s user experience and interface. In fact, the marketplace is integrated directly into Particl Desktop, the network’s flagship client, and is designed in a way that makes it easy for everyone to quickly understand how it works. Forget the usual boring and ugly look of cryptocurrency wallets — the Open Marketplace is not only very pleasant to the eye, it is also a very intuitive platform that won’t require you to pull all of the hair out of your head just to figure out how to make it work.</p><p>Yes, this first version mainnet of the marketplace is a Beta build. Yes, there are definitely a lot of improvements that are going to be made so that it can be “grandma-friendly”, but as Particl always strives to improve its products on all aspects, and as UI/UX is one of the top focus of the team, it will keep getting better and more intuitive over time. According to today’s crypto standards, Particl Desktop is damn sexy, but the team’s target is set much higher than just being “good enough” for the crypto crowd.</p><h2 id=\"buy-stuff-for-crypto\">Buy Stuff for Crypto</h2><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qKOA4dOAFeM?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><ul><li><strong>No fee</strong></li><li><strong>No identifiable data generated or collected by any 3rd-party</strong></li><li><strong>No registration or account creation</strong></li><li><strong>Full escrow support</strong></li><li><strong>Untraceable currency transactions</strong></li></ul><p>It is already possible to buy many things with cryptocurrencies, but most options are full of friction and they introduce third-parties back in the game. These options either require you to (1) pay a hefty fee, (2) go through many steps and account registrations, or (3) sacrifice your personal data to some company.</p><p>In most cases, these options introduce all of the above mentioned issues. In all cases, the re-introduction of third-parties into the process is proving to be highly counter-productive and more troublesome than simply spending traditional currencies. Didn’t we start using Bitcoin because we wanted to get rid of middlemen? Then, why should we have to crawl back to them when we want to spend our coins?</p><p>Particl fixes all of that in one big swoop by providing a private-by-default marketplace that allows anyone to safely buy products and services online and pay for them using cryptocurrencies, but without having to deal with any of the three issues introduced by third-parties mentioned just above. After all, Bitcoin was initially created to be an ecosystem that’s entirely independent from third-parties, as demonstrated by <a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/satoshis-pre-release-bitcoin-code-contains-some-fascinating-findings/\"><strong>Satoshi’s early attempt at building a decentralized marketplace on top of the Bitcoin codebase</strong></a>.</p><p>The Open Marketplace is entirely decentralized and autonomous, meaning it doesn’t rely on any third-party to operate. The absence of any third-party means that you do not have to pay any fee or sacrifice your personal data in order to be able to use cryptocurrencies as actual currencies.</p><p>For the buyer, that means <strong>you will likely get access to more affordable products since vendors do not need to pay any fee</strong>, except for a small anti-spam listing fee. Keep in mind that some online vendors need to pay as high as 40% fee per sale, once every fee is paid. Sometimes, that’s even more. That is always reflected in the final price that we all pay when shopping online.</p><p>Save time and energy by <strong>instantly</strong> and <strong>directly</strong> connecting with vendors that already accept cryptocurrencies. Gone are the days you needed to continually browse the internet to find a vendor that sells the product you are looking for…and accepts cryptocurrencies at the same time.</p><h2 id=\"sell-stuff-for-crypto\">Sell Stuff for Crypto</h2><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/86ejmW0BkGI?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><ul><li><strong>No fee, except for a small listing fee of a few cents</strong></li><li><strong>No identifiable data generated or collected by any 3rd-party</strong></li><li><strong>No registration or account creation</strong></li><li><strong>Full escrow support</strong></li><li><strong>Untraceable currency transactions</strong></li></ul><p>Now, what if you would like to sell some stuff and accept cryptocurrencies? What if you wanted to make a business out of it? There are a few options available, but just like for buyers, they require the assistance of third-parties to function. This introduces a lot of issues for vendors such as (1) paying very high fees, (2) requiring a lot of paperwork and sign ups, and (3) sacrificing your business data to some company.</p><p>Thanks to its decentralized structure, the Open Marketplace fixes the issues mentioned above by allowing sellers to earn cryptocurrencies by putting products and services up for sale on the platform, but without using of any third-party or company. The only fee sellers are required to pay, aside from the usual cryptocurrency transaction fee, is a small anti-spam listing fee of a few cents per day. Everything else is at a big fat 0% fee. For most people selling online, this is about as big of as deal as it gets!</p><p>Imagine you’re a seller and paying something like 40% fee per transaction, or even “just” 15%. Suddenly being charged ~0% on your sales represents a huge opportunity and can change your business around in a major way. Not only can <strong>you make much more profit per sale</strong>, but <strong>you can also reduce your prices to gain a net advantage over your competitors</strong>.</p><p>And, since the Open Marketplace is a crypto-focused two-sided marketplace, meaning the platform is populated by both active sellers and buyers, it is the ideal place to sell items for cryptocurrencies without having to waste hours finding a target audience that is not only looking for your product, but also willing to spend cryptocurrencies for it.</p><h2 id=\"double-deposit-escrow-system\">Double Deposit Escrow System</h2><p><a href=\"https://particl.wiki/marketplace#decentralized_escrow\"><strong>Particl Wiki — Double Deposit Escrow System</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.wiki/marketplace#decentralized_escrow\"><em>Particl's Open Marketplace is a decentralized marketplace built with privacy at its core.

However, market management and market user management tools will come at a later time during the Beta phase of development and won’t be part of the initial mainnet version of the marketplace.</p><hr><p>With all of that being said, the Particl Open Marketplace will be the first privacy-focused decentralized marketplace of its kind to ever see the day and will mark an important milestone in the history of online eCommerce. <strong>It will go live, on mainnet, on the 12th of August 2019 and will include all features mentioned in this blog post.</strong></p><p>But don’t get too complacent, this is just the beginning of one very epic journey in disrupting one of the biggest sector of the global economy. This release will also mark the beginning of the Open Marketplace’s Beta phase of development, and it will only get more interesting and exciting from here on out. Moving forward, you can expect many more features to be included to it, making it a real behemoth in both the blockchain and eCommerce worlds. You can also expect more users to start using it, as well as more third-party integrations to see the day. Suffice to say, there’s a lot of good stuff coming up for Particl, and each milestone that will be reached from this point onward will be more exciting than the previous one.</p><p>Buckle up, because this train is finally getting moving, and there ain’t no stopping after it gets released out in the open!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace---What-to-Expect-on-Day-1/1-cx5kMA6I0j5UIUCKprYfuQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":["kg-card","kg-image-card"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace---What-to-Expect-on-Day-1/1-gAK1frBqYBuhi6WzZZpftg.jpeg","className":["kg-image"],"alt":""},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Particl’s Open Marketplace is finally just a few days away, within an arm’s reach!

There is no third-party or\nintermediary operating it or having any sort of control over its network. It\nuses a mix of P2P and blockchain technologies, meaning that it is exclusively\nrun by its global community of users.\n\nThe Open Marketplace is an equally decentralized application that’s built on top\nof the Particl network. It allows anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and\nservices, physical or digital, regardless of where they are located in the\nworld. And because it is entirely decentralized, there’s no staff or support\nteam to enforce rules and policies.\n\nFurthermore, the Open Marketplace is completely private by default, meaning no\nidentifiable data can be linked to any of its users. Transactions are hidden on\nthe blockchain, images are stripped of their metadata, data exchange is\nencrypted, and you can even connect the marketplace through the Tor network. In\nother words, users of the marketplace are anonymous.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started\nTo download the Particl Open Marketplace, go to https://particl.io/downloads or \nget it directly from Github\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.0.1].\n\nparticl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.0.1]\nYou can't perform that action at this time.

If you have ever run the Particl Open Marketplace on mainnet before, you\n    will need to wipe your existing marketplace database, otherwise, you may\n    encounter errors that will break your experience. The location of your\n    particl-market is dependent on the OS you use.\n\n * Windows:C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Roaming\\particl-market\n * macOS:~/Library/Application Support/particl-market\n * Linux:~/.particl-market\n\n2. To use the marketplace, you need to create a marketplace-enabled wallet. To\ndo that, you need to first create a normal wallet as usual. Then, once that is\ndone, create a second wallet and name in Market. Once generated, that wallet\nwill have the marketplace enabled.\n\nFor a complete tutorial on how to download, install, and setup the Particl Open\nMarketplace, follow this link: \nhttps://particl.news/tutorial-how-to-use-the-private-and-trustless-particl-marketplace-11839ea30e09\n\nFor a Wiki version, follow this link: \nhttps://particl.wiki/prepare-install-marketplace\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to Use the Open Marketplace\nAlthough the Particl Open Marketplace proposes a new and improved way to shop\nand do business online, it isn’t too different than the marketplaces you’re used\nto use.\n\nFor buyers and sellers, the simple process of going through a transaction can be\nsummarized as follow:\n\n * The buyer places an order\n * The seller accepts the order\n * The buyer locks his funds in escrow\n * The seller locks his funds in escrow\n * The seller packages and ships the order. A tracking number can be included at\n   this point\n * The buyer receives the order, inspects it, and marks the transaction as\n   complete\n\nSounds easy? That’s because it is! In fact, the process of purchasing and\nselling something online without sacrificing your data shouldn’t be a chore and\nshould be accessible to as many people as possible. Yet, if you want to have a\nfull breakdown of how to use the Particl Open Marketplace, you can either read \nthis tutorial blog post\n[https://particl.news/understanding-and-use-of-the-particl-marketplace-9866cd8190f5] \nor consult this Wiki step-by-step guide [https://particl.wiki/how-to-buy-sell].\n\nWhat Can You Buy & Sell\nParticl’s Open Marketplace is a two-sided marketplace. By definition, a\ntwo-sided marketplace is a marketplace for “exchange between\n[https://reasonstreet.co/business-model-two-sided-marketplace/]two\n[https://reasonstreet.co/business-model-two-sided-marketplace/] distinct user\ngroups that provide each other with the benefits of a large network\n[https://reasonstreet.co/business-model-two-sided-marketplace/]”.\n\nThat means it is entirely up to the users to figure out what they want to buy\nand what they want to sell, and when demand arises, supply should usually follow\nto fill a void. The best example of a two-sided marketplace is eBay — a\nmarketplace where both sellers and buyers are “customers” of and provide each\nother benefits (the seller provides the buyer with items they’re looking for,\nand the buyer provides the sellers with revenue).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Next?\nThis is only the beginning of a long journey for Particl. This mainnet release,\ndubbed a Beta release, marks the first mainnet iteration of many to come for the\nmarketplace.\n\nIt means a lot of intended features are still not implemented yet, and that a\nlot of improvement will be made along the way. This is why your feedback will be\nextremely valuable. What do you think is missing from this marketplace? How was\nyour experience in a particular situation and how could it be improved?\n\nIn the foreseeable future, the Particl team will be focusing on developing some\nof the core features identified earlier in the year. That includes, but isn’t\nlimited to:\n\n * A mobile application and/or mobile integration\n * The possibility to use other coins on Particl Desktop and/or the marketplace\n * A market management tool allowing for the management of multiple user markets\n * A comment section to allow reviews to be logged in\n * Listing price pegging to allow listings to dynamically adjust their prices in\n   PART\n * And more…\n\nBut for now, it is time to play with the world’s most private and decentralized\nmarketplace as much as possible and observe how it will play out. The Particl\nteam will be on the lookout and will be collecting feedback over the course of\nthe next few days/weeks.\n\nThis important period will certainly help shape the future of the project and\nestablish short to mid-term development priorities.\n\nSo install the marketplace, and let’s get down to business!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-is-Now-Live-on-Mainnet/1-89WBhJh6pZ1PBeAKZB2M3A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>It is finally here!

There is no third-party or\nintermediary operating it and having any sort of control over its network. It\nuses a mix of P2P and blockchain technologies, meaning that it is exclusively\nrun by its global community of users.\n\nThe Open Marketplace is an equally decentralized application that’s built on top\nof the Particl network. It allows anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and\nservices, physical or digital, regardless of where they are located in the\nworld. And because it is entirely decentralized, there’s no staff or support\nteam to enforce rules and policies.\n\nFurthermore, the Open Marketplace is completely private by default, meaning no\nidentifiable data can be linked to any of its users. Transactions are hidden on\nthe blockchain, images are stripped of their metadata, data exchange is\nencrypted, and you can even connect the marketplace through the Tor network. In\nother words, users of the marketplace are anonymous.\n\nUndesirable Content\nThis, however, introduces a bit of an issue when it comes to the content being\nput on there. After all, how can you prevent anyone from buying or selling\nanything when there are no rules and no central party with special permissions\nto moderate it? Giving special permissions/powers and allowing certain users to\ndelete content and hold such a strong position of power is a slippery slope and,\non a long enough timeline, ultimately a slow crawl back to the old ways where a\ncompany would run its own platform, impose its rules, and charge fees.\n\nBut this isn’t what Particl is about. No, Particl is about full decentralization\nand complete privacy. The recent years, with all of the data breaches like\nEquifax’s and the abuse of data like with the constant scandals involving\nFacebook, have shown without a doubt that the tech industry needs to evolve and\nstart protecting its users.\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f] \nAnd, because data has become so valuable and such a big target for hackers, we\ncannot expect or trust centralized models such as Amazon, Alibaba, eBay, and\ncentral parties, to effectively secure our data.\n\nThis is why Particl’s Open Marketplace is entirely decentralized and\nprivate-by-default. Its “trustless” nature, meaning that you do not need to\ntrust any entity to behave honestly, ensures that none of your data can be\ncollected by any party other than the ones you transact with. It is, simply put,\nthe next logical step in the evolution of eCommerce technology. But like any new\ngroundbreaking technology, it also introduces new challenges. Keeping the\nmarketplace free from undesirable listings is one of them.\n\nDecentralized Governance\nTo fight off undesirable content, Particl has put in place a completely\ndecentralized and provably fair governance mechanism where anyone can vote off\nundesirable listings.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQuick Facts:\n * Voting power ratio: 1 PART coin = 1 vote\n * Delisting threshold at time of publishing: -9,000 PART (adjustable)\n * Need to be staking?: No\n * Fee for flagging an item: Less than 0.001 PART for the first person to flag,\n   free for additional flaggers\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDelisting Threshold\nTo vote against a specific listing, users need to flag it using the Open\nMarketplace user interface. Once the first user marks a listing as undesirable,\nit gets taken into a queue of previously flagged listings where other users will\nbe able to either agree that it should be taken off the marketplace, or disagree\nand vote for it to remain listed. For a listing to be completely delisted, its\nscore needs to reach a certain negative threshold.\n\nParticl’s decentralized moderation system can be compared to the Reddit\nupvote/downvote system. On Reddit, if 5 users downvote a post, and 3 users\nupvote it, the post has a score of -2. Usually, when it reaches a certain\nnegative threshold (i.e. -10), the post is automatically hidden from other\nusers. Reddit counts votes on a 1 user = 1 vote basis.\n\nParticl’s listing moderation system is similar. Each user that flags and votes\nfor a listing contributes to either increasing or decreasing the listing’s\nscore. It also deletes the listing from the user’s personal instance of the\nclient (deleted locally, but not hidden globally until the listing reaches the\ndelisting threshold). But because Particl is private by design and entirely\ndecentralized, there is no real way for the platform to detect a user that\ncreated multiple addresses or used virtual machines to game the system and\nregister fraudulent votes. The network cannot ban an account, blacklist an IP\naddress, or manually adjust votes to try to fight off spam votes.\n\nInstead, Particl counts votes on a 1 coin = 1 vote, which makes it impossible to\ngame the system. If you want to add more power to your votes, you can do it in a\nlegitimate way: acquire more PART coins. No matter how many wallets you use, or\nno matter how many times you try changing your IP address, the system only takes\nthe “coin weight” into consideration when counting votes. This ensures only\nthose with a stake in the network can influence governance outcomes.\n\nThe delisting threshold of the Particl Open Marketplace will be -9,000 during\nthe first mainnet version. That threshold can and will be adjusted on the way\nforward. It may take a few tweaks until the perfect ratio is reached, but\nbecause game-theory is impossible to test on testnet (because test coins don’t\nhold any value), it has to be tested out in the wild.\n\nGame-Theory\nAs you probably now realize, this mechanism is actually pretty simple, but it’s\nalso quite strong and effective. The reason behind this is the whole game-theory \naspect of it.\n\nTo have significant voting power and single-handedly influence votes, a user\nneeds to acquire a lot of coins. This can be quite expensive depending on the\nactive delisting threshold ratio (in the first mainnet version of the\nmarketplace, that threshold will be -9,000), and it only gets more expensive as\nthe platform starts getting more network effect.\n\nAnd because voters have a direct financial stake in the network, they are\ndirectly incentivized to behave correctly. If voters colluded with each other\nand started trolling or censoring the marketplace, that would arguably reduce\nthe value of the network and incur a net loss for all co-conspirators.\n\nAdditionally, if users do not pro-actively keep the public interface of the\nmarketplace clean, it might result in a platform filled with undesirable or\nspammy content, which would contribute to driving people away. That, too, would\nseverely reduce the potential network effect and would be a serious obstacle to\nParticl reaching a more mainstream audience.\n\nSince voters are users with a financial stake in the network, driving users away\nfrom the platform is not something being desired. That is especially true of a\nmarketplace — more users mean more products to buy (for buyers) and more\npotential customers to reach (for vendors). That is why keeping the interface\nclean is a small, but not insignificant, contribution each user can make to the\nnetwork.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFAQ\n * What’s the delisting threshold?\n * The delisting threshold is currently at -9,000 for the first mainnet version\n   of the Open Marketplace. This threshold can and will be adjusted moving\n   forward.\n\n—\n\n * Will listings disappear after I vote them off?\n * When you flag a listing, it is deleted locally, meaning that it is taken off\n   your own personal instance of the marketplace, but not for other users. A\n   listing is only delisted from everyone’s marketplace instance once it reaches\n   the delisting threshold.\n\n—\n\n * Do I need to be staking to vote?\n * No, coins do not need to be staking. Anyone with a coin can vote.\n\n—\n\n * Can I vote if my coins are stored on a hardware device?\n * Not initially, but hardware device support is something being considered for\n   later in the future.\n\n—\n\n * Is there a fee for flagging listings?\n * If you are the first user to flag a listing that has never been flagged\n   before, you will need to be a sub-cent fee (0.00x PART or less). If you are\n   flagging a listing that’s already been flagged before, then there is no fee\n   to be paid.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est. July, 2025\n * Implementation: Upon successful vote (75% approval rate with minimum quorum\n   of 20% of the total supply over 10,080 blocks) and subsequent hard fork.\n\nImpact\nIf approved, this change will:\n\n * Significantly reduce PART's inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%;\n * Reduce PART’s inflation rate by 0.5% every year until it reaches 1.0%;\n * Remove the network treasury;\n * Initiate a hard fork of the Particl blockchain.\n\nWe believe this proposal represents a positive step toward optimizing the\nParticl network's economic model while ensuring sustainable project development\nand incentivising our community to actively promote and grow the\nnetwork.Important: For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are\nrunning its latest version.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come.
