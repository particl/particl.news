Although there isn’t a ton of new stuff to report,\npartly due to a well-deserved break the developers took during the holidays,\ngood progress has been made on several fronts.\n\nLet’s get down to the details of it!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNew Particl Core Releases\nAs mentioned recently, Particl Core developer Tecnovert has been ramping up\ndevelopment in various areas, notably in keeping Particl Core up-to-date with\nBitcoin’s codebase. As we walk through 2021, you can expect core elements and\nupdates to be more frequent than they have been in the past year or so.\n\nTo that end, two new core releases were published as pre-releases this month;\nParticl Core 0.19.2.3 and Particl Core 0.21.0.1.\n\nToday, on the 28th of January, 2021, Particl Core 0.19.2.3 has been fully\nreleased [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.3] and\nhas exited its pre-release phase.\n\nParticl Core 0.19.2.3\n * Download: https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.3\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.3]\n\nThe new Particl Core 0.19.2.3 full release is mostly composed of minor bug fixes\nand improvements. It also re-introduces 32bit builds for Windows, which has now\nbeen abandoned by Bitcoin, making Particl accessible to an even wider range of\nusers across the globe. This lets users with less powerful or more dated\ncomputers access Particl Core and Particl Marketplace in less technically\nequipped environments. The full changelog is as follows:\n\n * Merged Bitcoin 0.19.2 backports.\n * New PoW checkpoints.\n * Fix smsginbox hex encoding bug.\n * Tighten IsStandard() check to fail on trailing script.\n * Re-enable win32 gitian build.\n\nParticl Core 0.21.0.1\n * Download: https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.0.1\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.0.1]\n\nThe Particl Core 0.21.0.1 is a much bigger release compared to the 0.19.2.3 one.\nIt’s the first significant core update since the 4th of December, 2019, and it\nincludes a vast number of improvements derived from Bitcoin Core 0.20 and 0.21.\nHere are some of the most noteworthy.\n\n * New RPC call to easily create and share a secure blockchain snapshot that\n   allows you to start using the blockchain while it hasn’t fully synced yet.\n * Asmap functionality\n   [https://cryptooof.com/bitcoin-core-brings-asmap-as-an-antidote-to-erebus-attack/] \n   for more reliable and decentralized network connectivity.\n * Tor V3 support\n   [https://decrypt.co/44640/bitcoins-next-upgrade-will-support-tor-v3-addresses] \n   for better network privacy. Tor will deprecate V2 addresses in the next year\n   or two, making this a critical update to Particl Core.\n * Schnorr signatures\n   [https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/the-power-of-schnorr-the-signature-algorithm-to-increase-bitcoin-s-scale-and-privacy-1460642496] \n   and Taproot\n   [https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/taproot-coming-what-it-and-how-it-will-benefit-bitcoin] \n   readiness for more privacy and scalability. This has yet to be activated,\n   however, but Particl Core is now ready for it.\n * No default wallet created when launching Particl Core for the first time.\n * “Compact client-side block filtering” for more privacy-friendly light\n   wallets.\n * Various issue and bug fixes as well as general improvements that operate more\n   in the background\n\nParticl Core 0.21.0.1 is published as a pre-release, meaning it still requires a\nmore extensive period of testing across different environments before being\ndeployed as a full release. As has been the tradition with Particl, this is to\nensure the stability and security of this new release. Once it gets fully\nreleased, Particl Core 0.21.0.1 will then supercede Particl Core 0.19.2.3.\n\nIf you find any issue with Particl Core 0.21.0.1, please report them directly to \nParticl’s particl-core Github issue page\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/issues].\n\nParticl V3\nParticl V3, which includes the new Particl Desktop client and the improved\nmarketplace codebase, has progressed well. Here are the current two areas that\nare still being worked on.\n\n * Fixing minor bugs and issues identified by the community during the testing\n   round for the first testnet build.\n * Fixing a more extensive problem related to Windows builds prevents some users\n   from launching the application normally.\n\nAlthough the minor bugs and issues are expected to be fixed quickly, the Windows\nissue is a more complicated one, requiring much more effort. A new testnet build\nof Particl V3 will likely be released very shortly, but it may not yet include\nthe fix for the Windows issue.\n\nThis would give the opportunity to the community to, once again, test out the\nbuild and make sure no new issue has appeared as a result of the various fixes\nthat are being implemented. And then, once the Windows issue is fixed, a new\ntestnet build will be immediately published. If no new problem arises after this\npoint, Particl V3 will then be ready to immediately initiate its move towards\nmainnet.\n\nParticl Academy\nThe Particl Academy is nearing completion and is still scheduled for release\nbefore the Particl V3 mainnet. Take note that, following Particl’s ethos, the\nentire Particl Academy platform will be open-sourced on Github. That’ll allow\nanyone in the community to contribute with content, propose changes, or improve\nany aspect.\n\nCCS System\nThere are two important topics worth mentioning regarding the CCS proposal\nsystem.\n\nFirst off, a major proposal was pushed roughly one month ago and has raised\napproximately 65% of its target with 29 participants contributing! It suggests\nseeding the marketplace with thousands of real items that will be able to be\nanonymously purchased. The entire buying process for these items will be\nautomated, meaning a swift and smooth user experience.\n\nTo support this initiative, please feel free to donate to the proposal by\nfollowing this link\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html].\n\nSeeding Items to the MarketplaceLudx and Cryptoguard\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html]Secondly,\nthe Particl team has started preparing, code-wise and logistically, to integrate\nthe new on-chain voting module into the CCS system. This will let community\nmembers push proposals that may require a consensus to be reached. Such\nproposals can include protocol changes, Community Fund movement, etc.\n\nMore details will be provided shortly about the consensus requirements (what is\nneeded for a proposal to be deemed as “having reached consensus”) as well as the\non-chain voting system in general and its expected time of arrival.\n\nParticl.News Translations\nA while ago, valuable Particl community members started translating key blog\nposts. However, due to the limitative nature of Medium, they couldn’t be\nproperly displayed on Particl.News. This has now changed with Particl’s blog\nmigration from Medium to Ghost.\n\nTranslated articles are now being published on Particl News\n[https://particl.news]! These translated articles do not show up, by default, on\nthe blog’s main page but can be easily accessed by clicking the right language\nflag at the top right corner of the screen.\n\nAs translations are a big part of making Particl accessible to the global\ncommunity, we’d like to thank all these contributors for their hard work in\ntranslating these articles. They are WhiteFlag (Spanish), Laurogripa \n(Portuguese), Mbacoinin and Stock999 (Russian), and Anonymouser (Philippines)!\n\nIf you would like to contribute to Particl and help out translating content into\nyour native language, please reach out on Particl’s Discord server or Telegram\nchannels. We’ll be happy to see with you what content is the most important to\ntranslate and publish your work on Particl News [https://particl.news].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Needs YOU!\nAs we now find ourselves on the verge of going live with the second testing\nround of Particl v3, Particl needs your help! So get your machines ready so that\nwe can all blast through this new testing round ensuring a fast, but secure,\nmigration towards mainnet. \n\nIn the meantime, you can be of crucial help by testing out the new Particl Core\n0.21.0.1 release. Testing it across many different environments (operating\nsystems, hardware setups, etc) helps picking up potential issues more\neffectively and moving forward more effectively.\n\nAs always, the entire Particl team would like to warmly thank you for your\ncontinued support through the years so far. Let's, together, make 2021 a great\nyear for Particl and the world of decentralized e-commerce in general!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

As we walk through 2021, you can expect core elements and updates to be more frequent than they have been in the past year or so.</p><p>To that end, two new core releases were published as pre-releases this month; Particl Core 0.19.2.3 and Particl Core 0.21.0.1.</p><p><strong>Today, on the 28th of January, 2021, <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.3\">Particl Core 0.19.2.3 has been fully released</a> and has exited its pre-release phase.</strong></p><h2 id=\"particl-core-0-19-2-3\">Particl Core 0.19.2.3</h2><ul><li><strong>Download:</strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.3\"> https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.3</a></li></ul><p>The new Particl Core 0.19.2.3 full release is mostly composed of minor bug fixes and improvements. It also <strong>re-introduces 32bit builds</strong> for Windows, which has now been abandoned by Bitcoin, making Particl accessible to an even wider range of users across the globe. This lets users with less powerful or more dated computers access Particl Core and Particl Marketplace in less technically equipped environments. The full changelog is as follows:</p><ul><li>Merged Bitcoin 0.19.2 backports.</li><li>New PoW checkpoints.</li><li>Fix <code class=\"language-text\">smsginbox</code> hex encoding bug.</li><li>Tighten <code class=\"language-text\">IsStandard()</code> check to fail on trailing script.</li><li>Re-enable win32 gitian build.</li></ul><h2 id=\"particl-core-0-21-0-1\">Particl Core 0.21.0.1</h2><ul><li><strong>Download:</strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.0.1\"> https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.0.1</a></li></ul><p>The Particl Core 0.21.0.1 is a much bigger release compared to the 0.19.2.3 one. It’s the first significant core update since the 4th of December, 2019, and it includes a vast number of improvements derived from Bitcoin Core 0.20 and 0.21.

As has been the tradition with Particl, this is to ensure the stability and security of this new release. Once it gets fully released, Particl Core 0.21.0.1 will then supercede Particl Core 0.19.2.3.</p><p>If you find any issue with Particl Core 0.21.0.1, please report them directly to <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/issues\"><strong>Particl’s particl-core Github issue page</strong></a>.</p><h1 id=\"particl-v3\">Particl V3</h1><p>Particl V3, which includes the new Particl Desktop client and the improved marketplace codebase, has progressed well. Here are the current two areas that are still being worked on.</p><ul><li><strong>Fixing minor bugs and issues</strong> identified by the community during the testing round for the first testnet build.</li><li><strong>Fixing a more extensive problem related to Windows builds</strong> prevents some users from launching the application normally.</li></ul><p>Although the minor bugs and issues are expected to be fixed quickly, the Windows issue is a more complicated one, requiring much more effort. <strong>A new testnet build of Particl V3 will likely be released very shortly, but it may not yet include the fix for the Windows issue.</strong></p><p>This would give the opportunity to the community to, once again, test out the build and make sure no new issue has appeared as a result of the various fixes that are being implemented. And then, once the Windows issue is fixed, a new testnet build will be immediately published. <strong>If no new problem arises after this point, Particl V3 will then be ready to immediately initiate its move towards mainnet.</strong></p><h1 id=\"particl-academy\">Particl Academy</h1><p><strong>The Particl Academy is nearing completion</strong> and is still scheduled for release before the Particl V3 mainnet. Take note that, following Particl’s ethos, the entire Particl Academy platform will be open-sourced on Github. That’ll allow anyone in the community to contribute with content, propose changes, or improve any aspect.</p><h1 id=\"ccs-system\">CCS System</h1><p>There are two important topics worth mentioning regarding the CCS proposal system.</p><p>First off, <strong>a major proposal was pushed roughly one month ago and has raised approximately 65% of its target with 29 participants contributing</strong>! It suggests seeding the marketplace with thousands of real items that will be able to be anonymously purchased. The entire buying process for these items will be automated, meaning a swift and smooth user experience.</p><p>To support this initiative, please feel free to donate to the proposal by following <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html\"><strong>this link</strong></a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Seeding Items to the Marketplace</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\"></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://ccs.particl.io/img/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png?v=2\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Ludx and Cryptoguard</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://ccs.particl.io/img/particl-ccs-logo.svg\"></div></a></figure><p>Secondly, the Particl team has started preparing, code-wise and logistically, to <strong>integrate the new on-chain voting module into the CCS system</strong>. This will let community members push proposals that may require a consensus to be reached. Such proposals can include protocol changes, Community Fund movement, etc.</p><p>More details will be provided shortly about the consensus requirements (what is needed for a proposal to be deemed as “having reached consensus”) as well as the on-chain voting system in general and its expected time of arrival.</p><h1 id=\"particl-news-translations\">Particl.News Translations</h1><p>A while ago, valuable Particl community members started translating key blog posts. However, due to the limitative nature of Medium, they couldn’t be properly displayed on Particl.News. This has now changed with Particl’s blog migration from Medium to Ghost.</p><p><strong>Translated articles are now being published on </strong><a href=\"https://particl.news\"><strong>Particl News</strong></a>! These translated articles do not show up, by default, on the blog’s main page but can be easily accessed by clicking the right language flag at the top right corner of the screen.</p><p>As translations are a big part of making Particl accessible to the global community, we’d like to thank all these contributors for their hard work in translating these articles. They are <strong>WhiteFlag</strong> (Spanish), <strong>Laurogripa</strong> (Portuguese), <strong>Mbacoinin </strong>and<strong> Stock999</strong> (Russian), and <strong>Anonymouser</strong> (Philippines)!<br><br>If you would like to contribute to Particl and help out translating content into your native language, please reach out on Particl’s Discord server or Telegram channels. We’ll be happy to see with you what content is the most important to translate and publish your work on <a href=\"https://particl.news\"><strong>Particl News</strong></a>.</p><hr><h2 id=\"particl-needs-you-\">Particl Needs YOU!</h2><p>As we now find ourselves on the verge of going live with the second testing round of Particl v3, Particl needs your help! So get your machines ready so that we can all blast through this new testing round ensuring a fast, but secure, migration towards mainnet. </p><p>In the meantime, you can be of crucial help by testing out the new Particl Core 0.21.0.1 release. Testing it across many different environments (operating systems, hardware setups, etc) helps picking up potential issues more effectively and moving forward more effectively.</p><p>As always, the entire Particl team would like to warmly thank you for your continued support through the years so far. Let's, together, make 2021 a great year for Particl and the world of decentralized e-commerce in general!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

С тех пор людьми со всего мира\nбыли совершены сотни полностью анонимных торговых сделок, без комиссий и\nпосредников. Но скоро это всё станет намного интереснее благодаря предстоящему\nмасштабному обновлению!\n\nМаски N95 есть в продаже на Particl, без запретовНачиная от масок и снаряжения\nдля выживания, запрещенных во время COVID-19 на большинстве торговых площадок в\nинтернете, и до видеоигр, подарочных карт, физических монет Bitcoin, созданных\nCasascius, медицинского каннабиса или предметов искусства - все виды товаров уже\nпродаются на открытой торговой площадке Particl. А ещё представьте, что вы могли\nбы создать свой собственный магазин и полностью его контролировать, в том числе\nи то, кто его сможет увидеть в сети и кто сможет там покупать... Что бы вы там\nпродавали?\n\nВозможно, вы хотите открыть специализированный рынок для фрилансеров? Или-\nмагазин CBD-продуктов, доступный широкой публике? А может - сообщество для\nторговли драгоценными металлами? Или-частную площадку для торговли монетами\nCasascius и другими коллекционными монетами? Или место для торговли NFT без\nриска быть обманутым? Площадку для торговли продуктами криптоискусства, но без\nкомиссий посредника? Или, возможно, вы просто хотите продать свою учетную запись\nReddit, полную кармы? Тогда вы точно полюбите Particl Desktop 3.0\n(Multi-Markets) -следующее обновление от Particl, просто потому, что оно\nпозволяет все это и ещё многое другое,чего не было когда-либо раньше.\n\nДалее мы рассмотрим подробнее все, что может предложить Particl Desktop 3.0!‌‌‌‌\nИли вы уже знаете все о Particl Marketplace? Тогда переходите прямо к разделу \nобновлений Particl Desktop 3.0, ниже в этой статье.\n\nСодержание\nЧто такое Particl Marketplace?‌‌\nЭволюция с момента запуска\nЧто нового в Particl Desktop 3.0‌‌\nЧто будет дальше после выпуска V3\n\nЧто такое Particl Marketplace? \nParticl Marketplace- это децентрализованная торговая площадка, где люди могут\nпокупать и продавать что-либо в Интернете без участия каких-либо посредников,\nконфиденциально и безопасно. Здесь нет банков и посторонних платежных систем,\nнет ни управляющего торговой площадкой, ни модератора, т.е. никто третий не\nвидит ваши персональные данные. Все надежно зашифровано и доступно только вам и\nчеловеку с которым вы совершаете сделку. Для предотвращения мошенничества\nиспользуется полностью автоматизированная двусторонняя система условного\nдепонирования.\n\nТорговая площадка Particl Marketplace в Particl Desktop V2Отсутствие нужды в\nуслугах каких-либо посредников полностью меняет все правила электронной\nкоммерции и открывает массу новых возможностей, которые иначе были бы просто\nневозможны. Это означает, что два человека, желающие совершить безопасную сделку\nкупли-продажи в Интернете, больше не нуждаются в помощи коммерческих\nпосредников, обычно получающих с этого немалую прибыль. Particl Marketplace\nработает в одноранговой сети p2p, состоящей из независимых нодов пользователей,\nи соответственно, никто не взимает плату для покрытия расходов и получения\nдохода. Это монументально, учитывая что работающие в Интернете рыночные площадки\nобычно взимают от 5% до 50% за свои услуги. И эти затраты, естественно,\nотражается на розничной цене продуктов и услуг, продаваемых на тех торговых\nплощадках.\n\nКроме отсутствия комиссий, Particl Marketplace ещё и дает возможность чтобы эта\nэлектронная коммерция p2p была полностью конфиденциальной и анонимной. Сочетание\nразличных протоколов защиты конфиденциальности, таких как RingCT, CT, скрытые\nадреса, Tor, надежное шифрование и других, гарантирует, что вы не оставите\nникакого цифрового следа при совершении покупок или продаж в сети. Попрощайтесь\nс утечками личной информации, навязчивой рекламой, использованием ваших данных\nпротив вас и другими неловкими моментами. Particl Marketplace не хранит ваших\nданных и, следовательно - никаких неприятностей не может быть!\n\nПроще говоря, Particl Marketplace - это децентрализованная конфиденциальная\nэлектронная коммерция, э-коммерция 2.0. Это ДеКоммерция!\n\nЭволюция с момента запуска\nКоманда Particl выпустила множество релизов торговой площадки с момента первого\nзапуска в основной сети 12 августа 2019 года (Particl Desktop 2.0.0), в которых\nбыли добавлены несколько важных функций и значительно улучшены все компоненты.\n\nВот некоторые из этих основных улучшений и добавленных функций :\n\n Вопросы и ответы по размещению товаров\nИмпорт товара / списка товаров\nПлатежи в биткоине\nSMSG-боты (дополнительные сторонние сервисы, которые моут быть   подключены)\nВозможность отмены заказа\nСнижение платы за размещение товара\nНастройки\nМножество улучшений UI/UX\nМножество улучшений кодовой базы торговой площадки\nИсправлено много багов\n\nНет сомнений, что торговая площадка Particl Marketplace достигла значительного\nпрогресса в развитии с момента запуска на основной сети, планомерно продвигаясь\nпо своей дорожной карте. Она была значительно улучшена по производительности и\nвосприятию, а также получила набор новых функций.\n\nСовершенно новые торговая площадка и приложение Particl Desktop‌‌\nПосле реализации поддержки биткон-платежей на Particl Marketplace (Particl\nDesktop 2.3.0) 25 ноября, команда работала над следующей значительной функцией\n(Particl Desktop 2.4.0) - Multi-Markets, или «Infinite Markets», как ее назвали\nнекоторые члены сообщества.\n\nMulti-Markets дает возможность создавать бесконечное количество пользовательских\nрынков и магазинов в сети Particl. По сути, это превращает торговую площадку\nParticl Marketplace в хостинг широкой сети рынков и магазинов, созданных\nпользователями. Это основной элемент текущей дорожной карты Particl.\n\nПервоначально планировалось только добавить в Particl Desktop 2.4.0 возможность\nсоздавать либо присоединяться к бесконечному количеству рынков и магазинов.\nОднако эта новая функция потребовала изменений очень большой части кодовой базы,\nи, как следствие, это дало прекрасную возможность сделать значительно больший\nрывок вперед, намного больше чем предполагалось. И вот почему ...\n\nОбновление кодовой базы\nParticl Desktop, кроме Particl Marketplace, также содержит и отличный кошелек\nдля криптовалюты. Он хорошо выглядит, хорошо себя чувствует, и делает все что\nвам обычно нужно от криптовалютного кошелька, и даже больше. Доказательством\nможет служить то, что его часто форкали  и адаптировали другие проекты с\nоткрытым исходным кодом в качестве их основного кошелька.\n\nНо всему свое время. Учтите также, что приложению Particl Desktop уже\nисполнилось почти три года, и за это время команда приобрела большой опыт и\nзнания.\n\nВозможно приложение Particl Desktop было идеальным как для простого кошелька\nкриптовалюты и так для ранних версий торговой площадки, но оно начало проявлять\nограниченность в возможностях при тестировании  некоторых новых амбициозных\nфункций и возможностей, таких как мульти-рынки (Multi-Markets).\n\nИтак, поскольку для работы над версией Multi-Markets уже требовалось проделать\nочень много работы как с кодовой базой самой торговой площадки, так и с Desktop\nприложением, то команда Particl решила полностью перекодировать их и поднять на\nновый уровень. Таким образом, все компоненты Particl Desktop, и большая часть\nкодовой базы торговой площадки Particl Marketplace, были значительно улучшены, и\nтеперь поддерживаются новой и гораздо более современной кодовой базой.\nВот почему следующая версия Particl Desktop теперь будет иметь номер Particl\nDesktop 3.0.0 вместо 2.4.0.\n\nДобавлено больше возможностей, чем планировалось изначально‌‌\nВид панели инструментов пользователя Particl Marketplace в Particl Desktop 3.0В\nходе этого процесса перекодировки также стало очевидно, что некоторые ключевые\nфункции торговой площадки, изначально запланированные на будущее, могут быть\nинтегрированы в новую кодовую базу уже сейчас. Это немного задержит выпуск\nверсии Multi-Markets, но в конечном итоге сэкономит много времени в дальнейшем и\nупростит интеграцию новой кодовой базы в Desktop приложение. Команда Particl\nвыбрала именно этот путь, чтобы качество разработанных приложений всегда\nоставалось в приоритете.\n\nПо этой причине выпуск версии Multi-Markets был немного отложен, сравнительно с\nизначально ожидаемыми сроками. Но эта задержка того стоила, так как это дало\nкоманде возможность создать потрясающий продукт, который изменит правила игры в\nдецентрализованной электронной коммерции.\n\nЧто нового в Particl Desktop 3.0\nParticl Desktop V2 скоро пойдет на пенсию и новорожденная V3 займет его место! В\nэтой версии изменен не только номер, но также и весь внутренний код Desktop\nприложения, а также добавлено несколько функций. Это, пожалуй, самое большое\nобновление Particl Desktop с момента запуска основной сети.\n\nВот несколько примеров из того, что мы увидим в Particl Desktop 3.0:\n\nУлучшения Particl Desktop\n * Гораздо более легкое, быстрое, быстрее откликающееся и современное Desktop\n   приложение\n * Модульный подход. Кошельки, торговая площадка, обменник через атомарные свопы\n   и чат будут разделены на отдельные, независимые модули.\n * Все модули, включая торговую площадку, будут включены по умолчанию при\n   начальном запуске (после установки).\n * Значительно улучшенный пользовательский интерфейс, более интуитивный и\n   удобный\n * Почти бесчисленное количество исправлений ошибок, улучшений и настроек для\n   многих элементов кошелька и торговой площадки (большое спасибо всему\n   сообществу Particl за ценные отзывы ❤️)\n * Капитальный ремонт интерфейса встроенного модуля обмена криптовалют\n * Desktop приложение с поддержкой SDK (инструментов разработчика)\n\nУлучшения торговой площадки\n * Добавление новой панели управления торговой площадкой с расширенными\n   уведомлениями и быстрым доступом к основным разделам вашей учетной записи\n * Добавление multi-markets и возможности создавать бесконечное количество\n   пользовательских рынков и магазинов\n * Добавление браузера пользовательских рынков и магазинов с возможностью\n   просматра и присоединения к любому из них. Также их можно рекламировать в\n   этом браузере.\n * Улучшения в разделе Вопросов и Ответов по размещению товара - более легкий\n   доступ и более подробные объяснения\n * Добавление идентификаторов пользователей и профилей. Теперь пользователи\n   могут создавать бесконечное количество уникальных идентификаторов и затем\n   использовать их для анонимных отзывов об успешных сделках, проведенных с\n   кем-то определенным в прошлом. Таким образом, это позволяет продавцам и\n   покупателям сформировать себе анонимную репутацию, если они того пожелают.\n * Возможность добавления продавцами собственных категорий товаров для своих\n   рынков и магазинов\n * Значительное снижение платы за размещение листингов. Она будет снижена более\n   чем на 80% от текущей стоимости. Стоимость размещения товара на Particl\n   Marketplace будет значительно меньше 1 цента в эквиваленте PART!\n * Улучшения процесса взаимодействия Particl Desktop, кодовой базы Particl\n   Marketplace и SecureMessaging протокола  друг с другом\n\nПримечание: Поскольку версии Particl Desktop V2 и V3 и их рыночные площадки\nрадикально отличаются друг от друга, то и списки размещенных товаров также будут\nнесовместимы между версиями. Другими словами, товары, размещенные в V3 не будут\nотображаться в V2 и наоборот. Разумеется, вы всегда сможете вернуться к торговой\nплощадке версии V2, например чтобы выполнить какой-нибудь ещё невыполненный\nзаказ, который у вас мог там остаться.\n\nЧто будет дальше после выпуска V3\nВерсия Particl Desktop V3 станет важным шагом в выполнении дорожной карты\nParticl, так как она зачеркнет многие из ее элементов. Также она послужит\nтолчком для воплощения в жизнь многих других инициатив.\n\nБудут добавлены новые монеты\nНовый интерфейс встроенного модуля обмена валют в Particl Desktop V3После\nзапуска Particl Desktop 3.0 будет добавлено больше различных криптовалют во\nвстроенный модуль обмена. Это будет хорошей возможностью показать миру чем была\nзанята команда Particl в последние несколько месяцев, так как поможет проекту\nзаявить о себе в различных криптовалютных сообществах.\n\nСистема зашифрованных сообщений (е2ее чат)\nВ настоящее время DeMarkets.io разрабатывает полностью р2р локализованную\nсистему обмена зашифрованными сообщениями, которая позволит вам общаться\nконфиденциально с кем угодно в мире. Независимо от того, является ли этот\nчеловек покупателем, продавцом или просто другом - вы сможете обмениваться\nзащищенными сообщениями в сети Particl. Спасибо всем разработчикам DeMarkets.io\nза их вклад в создание этой системы децентрализованного чата! ❤\n\nАкадемия Particl\nАкадемия станет главным информационным центром Particl, где будет доступно\nинтерактивное руководство пользователя. Оно содержит всю основную информацию и\nвсе инструкции, необходимые для использования приложений платформы Particl в\nполной мере. Документация будет написана таким образом чтобы ее смог понять кто\nугодно, и это  облегчит адаптацию новых пользователей.\n\nПрограмма привлечения и поддержки продавцов\nПрограмма привлечения и поддержки продавцов(VOOP) - это программа, призванная\nупростить процесс привлечения новых продавцов и помочь им сделать свои первые\nшаги в мире децентрализованной электронной коммерции. Она также предоставляет\nвсе инструменты, необходимые каждому для активного участия в нахождении новых\nпродавцов и их присоединении к экосистеме Particl.\n\nДля помощи и поддержки новых продавцов VOOP предоставляет дополнительные\nпреимущества и льготы продавцам, которые решат участвовать в этой программе. К\nним относятся финансирование комиссий за размещение товаров, бесплатная реклама\nих рынков и магазинов, доступ к VIP-каналам, персонализированная поддержка,\nпривлечение больше внимания к ним в сообществе Particl и многие другие\nпреимущества. Программа также предоставит маркетинговый и информационный контент\nвсему сообществу, и таким образом, каждый сможет идти и искать новых продавцов\nдля рыночной платформы!\n\nНовый механизм голосования сообщества\nПриложение для холодного стейкинга Partyman недавно было обновлено новыми\nвозможностями для голосования. Эта система голосования более конфиденциальна и\nнадежна по сравнению со встроенной системой предложений в Particl Desktop. Более\nподробно о том, как использовать эту систему голосования и как она будет\nиспользоваться для управления Фондом сообщества - вскоре будет опубликовано на \nParticl.news [https://particl.news].\n\nДо выхода первой версии Particl Desktop 3.0 еще несколько недель, но ожидание\nтого стоит!

Здесь нет банков и посторонних платежных систем, нет ни управляющего торговой площадкой, ни модератора, т.е. никто третий не видит ваши персональные данные. Все надежно зашифровано и доступно только вам и человеку с которым вы совершаете сделку. Для предотвращения мошенничества используется полностью автоматизированная двусторонняя система условного депонирования.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/01/4YCfNX8A.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/4YCfNX8A.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/4YCfNX8A.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/01/4YCfNX8A.png 1270w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Торговая площадка Particl Marketplace в<i> Particl Desktop V2</i></figcaption></figure><p>Отсутствие нужды в услугах каких-либо посредников полностью меняет все правила электронной коммерции и открывает массу новых возможностей, которые иначе были бы просто невозможны. Это означает, что два человека, желающие совершить безопасную сделку купли-продажи в Интернете, больше не нуждаются в помощи коммерческих посредников, обычно получающих с этого немалую прибыль. Particl Marketplace работает в одноранговой сети p2p, состоящей из независимых нодов пользователей, и соответственно, никто не взимает плату для покрытия расходов и получения дохода. Это монументально, учитывая что работающие в Интернете рыночные площадки обычно взимают от 5% до 50% за свои услуги. И эти затраты, естественно, отражается на розничной цене продуктов и услуг, продаваемых на тех торговых площадках.</p><p>Кроме отсутствия комиссий, Particl Marketplace ещё и дает возможность чтобы эта электронная коммерция p2p была полностью конфиденциальной и анонимной. Сочетание различных протоколов защиты конфиденциальности, таких как RingCT, CT, скрытые адреса, Tor, надежное шифрование и других, гарантирует, что вы не оставите никакого цифрового следа при совершении покупок или продаж в сети. Попрощайтесь с утечками личной информации, навязчивой рекламой, использованием ваших данных против вас и другими неловкими моментами. Particl Marketplace не хранит ваших данных и, следовательно - никаких неприятностей не может быть!</p><p><strong>Проще говоря, Particl Marketplace - это децентрализованная конфиденциальная электронная коммерция, э-коммерция 2.0. Это ДеКоммерция!</strong></p><h3 id=\"--1\">Эволюция с момента запуска</h3><p>Команда Particl выпустила множество релизов торговой площадки с момента первого запуска в основной сети 12 августа 2019 года (Particl Desktop 2.0.0), в которых были добавлены несколько важных функций и значительно улучшены все компоненты.</p><p>Вот некоторые из этих основных улучшений и добавленных функций :</p><p><em>  Вопросы и ответы по размещению товаров<br>  Импорт товара / списка товаров<br>  Платежи в биткоине<br>  SMSG-боты (дополнительные сторонние сервисы, которые моут быть   подключены)<br>  Возможность отмены заказа<br>  Снижение платы за размещение товара<br>  Настройки<br>  Множество улучшений UI/UX<br>  Множество улучшений кодовой базы торговой площадки<br>  Исправлено много багов</em></p><p>Нет сомнений, что торговая площадка Particl Marketplace достигла значительного прогресса в развитии с момента запуска на основной сети, планомерно продвигаясь по своей дорожной карте. Она была значительно улучшена по производительности и восприятию, а также получила набор новых функций.</p><h6 id=\"-particl-desktop-\">Совершенно новые торговая площадка и приложение Particl Desktop‌‌</h6><p>После реализации поддержки биткон-платежей на Particl Marketplace (Particl Desktop 2.3.0) 25 ноября, команда работала над следующей значительной функцией (Particl Desktop 2.4.0) - Multi-Markets, или «Infinite Markets», как ее назвали некоторые члены сообщества.</p><p>Multi-Markets дает возможность создавать бесконечное количество пользовательских рынков и магазинов в сети Particl. По сути, это превращает торговую площадку Particl Marketplace в хостинг широкой сети рынков и магазинов, созданных пользователями. Это основной элемент текущей дорожной карты Particl.</p><p>Первоначально планировалось только добавить в Particl Desktop 2.4.0 возможность создавать либо присоединяться к бесконечному количеству рынков и магазинов. Однако эта новая функция потребовала изменений очень большой части кодовой базы, и, как следствие, это дало прекрасную возможность сделать значительно больший рывок вперед, намного больше чем предполагалось. И вот почему ...</p><h6 id=\"--2\">Обновление кодовой базы</h6><p>Particl Desktop, кроме Particl Marketplace, также содержит и отличный кошелек для криптовалюты. Он хорошо выглядит, хорошо себя чувствует, и делает все что вам обычно нужно от криптовалютного кошелька, и даже больше. Доказательством может служить то, что его часто форкали  и адаптировали другие проекты с открытым исходным кодом в качестве их основного кошелька.<br><br>Но всему свое время. Учтите также, что приложению Particl Desktop уже исполнилось почти три года, и за это время команда приобрела большой опыт и знания.<br><br>Возможно приложение Particl Desktop было идеальным как для простого кошелька криптовалюты и так для ранних версий торговой площадки, но оно начало проявлять ограниченность в возможностях при тестировании  некоторых новых амбициозных функций и возможностей, таких как мульти-рынки (Multi-Markets).<br><br>Итак, поскольку для работы над версией Multi-Markets уже требовалось проделать очень много работы как с кодовой базой самой торговой площадки, так и с Desktop приложением, то команда Particl решила полностью перекодировать их и поднять на новый уровень. Таким образом, все компоненты Particl Desktop, и большая часть кодовой базы торговой площадки Particl Marketplace, были значительно улучшены, и теперь поддерживаются новой и гораздо более современной кодовой базой.<br>Вот почему следующая версия Particl Desktop теперь будет иметь номер Particl Desktop 3.0.0 вместо 2.4.0.</p><h6 id=\"--3\">Добавлено больше возможностей, чем планировалось изначально‌‌</h6><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/01/o7SPtSdQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/o7SPtSdQ.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/o7SPtSdQ.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/01/o7SPtSdQ.png 1290w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Ви<i>д панели инструментов пользователя Particl Marketplace в Particl Desktop 3.0</i></figcaption></figure><p>В ходе этого процесса перекодировки также стало очевидно, что некоторые ключевые функции торговой площадки, изначально запланированные на будущее, могут быть интегрированы в новую кодовую базу уже сейчас. Это немного задержит выпуск версии Multi-Markets, но в конечном итоге сэкономит много времени в дальнейшем и упростит интеграцию новой кодовой базы в Desktop приложение. Команда Particl выбрала именно этот путь, чтобы качество разработанных приложений всегда оставалось в приоритете.</p><p>По этой причине выпуск версии Multi-Markets был немного отложен, сравнительно с изначально ожидаемыми сроками. Но эта задержка того стоила, так как это дало команде возможность создать потрясающий продукт, который изменит правила игры в децентрализованной электронной коммерции.</p><h3 id=\"-particl-desktop-3-0\">Что нового в Particl Desktop 3.0</h3><p>Particl Desktop V2 скоро пойдет на пенсию и новорожденная V3 займет его место! В этой версии изменен не только номер, но также и весь внутренний код Desktop приложения, а также добавлено несколько функций. Это, пожалуй, самое большое обновление Particl Desktop с момента запуска основной сети.</p><p>Вот несколько примеров из того, что мы увидим в Particl Desktop 3.0:</p><h6 id=\"-particl-desktop\">Улучшения Particl Desktop</h6><ul><li>Гораздо более легкое, быстрое, быстрее откликающееся и современное Desktop приложение</li><li>Модульный подход. Кошельки, торговая площадка, обменник через атомарные свопы и чат будут разделены на отдельные, независимые модули.</li><li>Все модули, включая торговую площадку, будут включены по умолчанию при начальном запуске (после установки).</li><li>Значительно улучшенный пользовательский интерфейс, более интуитивный и удобный</li><li>Почти бесчисленное количество исправлений ошибок, улучшений и настроек для многих элементов кошелька и торговой площадки (большое спасибо всему сообществу Particl за ценные отзывы ❤️)</li><li>Капитальный ремонт интерфейса встроенного модуля обмена криптовалют</li><li>Desktop приложение с поддержкой SDK (инструментов разработчика)</li></ul><h6 id=\"--4\">Улучшения торговой площадки</h6><ul><li>Добавление новой панели управления торговой площадкой с расширенными уведомлениями и быстрым доступом к основным разделам вашей учетной записи</li><li>Добавление multi-markets и возможности создавать бесконечное количество пользовательских рынков и магазинов</li><li>Добавление браузера пользовательских рынков и магазинов с возможностью просматра и присоединения к любому из них. Также их можно рекламировать в этом браузере.</li><li>Улучшения в разделе Вопросов и Ответов по размещению товара - более легкий доступ и более подробные объяснения</li><li>Добавление идентификаторов пользователей и профилей. Теперь пользователи могут создавать бесконечное количество уникальных идентификаторов и затем использовать их для анонимных отзывов об успешных сделках, проведенных с кем-то определенным в прошлом. Таким образом, это позволяет продавцам и покупателям сформировать себе анонимную репутацию, если они того пожелают.</li><li>Возможность добавления продавцами собственных категорий товаров для своих рынков и магазинов</li><li>Значительное снижение платы за размещение листингов. Она будет снижена более чем на 80% от текущей стоимости. Стоимость размещения товара на Particl Marketplace будет значительно меньше 1 цента в эквиваленте PART!</li><li>Улучшения процесса взаимодействия Particl Desktop, кодовой базы Particl Marketplace и SecureMessaging протокола  друг с другом</li></ul><p><em>Примечание: Поскольку версии Particl Desktop V2 и V3 и их рыночные площадки радикально отличаются друг от друга, то и списки размещенных товаров также будут несовместимы между версиями. Другими словами, товары, размещенные в V3 не будут отображаться в V2 и наоборот. Разумеется, вы всегда сможете вернуться к торговой площадке версии V2, например чтобы выполнить какой-нибудь ещё невыполненный заказ, который у вас мог там остаться.</em></p><h3 id=\"-v3\">Что будет дальше после выпуска V3</h3><p>Версия Particl Desktop V3 станет важным шагом в выполнении дорожной карты Particl, так как она зачеркнет многие из ее элементов. Также она послужит толчком для воплощения в жизнь многих других инициатив.</p><h6 id=\"--5\">Будут добавлены новые монеты</h6><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/01/sCfRTz6Q.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/sCfRTz6Q.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/sCfRTz6Q.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/01/sCfRTz6Q.png 1290w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Н<i>овый интерфейс встроенного модуля обмена валют в Particl Desktop V3</i></figcaption></figure><p>После запуска Particl Desktop 3.0 будет добавлено больше различных криптовалют во встроенный модуль обмена. Это будет хорошей возможностью показать миру чем была занята команда Particl в последние несколько месяцев, так как поможет проекту заявить о себе в различных криптовалютных сообществах.</p><h6 id=\"-2-\">Система зашифрованных сообщений (е2ее чат)</h6><p>В настоящее время DeMarkets.io разрабатывает полностью р2р локализованную систему обмена зашифрованными сообщениями, которая позволит вам общаться конфиденциально с кем угодно в мире. Независимо от того, является ли этот человек покупателем, продавцом или просто другом - вы сможете обмениваться защищенными сообщениями в сети Particl. Спасибо всем разработчикам DeMarkets.io за их вклад в создание этой системы децентрализованного чата! ❤</p><h6 id=\"-particl\">Академия Particl</h6><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/01/QFddiCew.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/QFddiCew.jpeg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/01/QFddiCew.jpeg 1000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Академия станет главным информационным центром Particl, где будет доступно интерактивное руководство пользователя. Оно содержит всю основную информацию и все инструкции, необходимые для использования приложений платформы Particl в полной мере. Документация будет написана таким образом чтобы ее смог понять кто угодно, и это  облегчит адаптацию новых пользователей.</p><h6 id=\"--6\">Программа привлечения и поддержки продавцов</h6><p>Программа привлечения и поддержки продавцов(VOOP) - это программа, призванная упростить процесс привлечения новых продавцов и помочь им сделать свои первые шаги в мире децентрализованной электронной коммерции. Она также предоставляет все инструменты, необходимые каждому для активного участия в нахождении новых продавцов и их присоединении к экосистеме Particl.</p><p>Для помощи и поддержки новых продавцов VOOP предоставляет дополнительные преимущества и льготы продавцам, которые решат участвовать в этой программе. К ним относятся финансирование комиссий за размещение товаров, бесплатная реклама их рынков и магазинов, доступ к VIP-каналам, персонализированная поддержка, привлечение больше внимания к ним в сообществе Particl и многие другие преимущества. Программа также предоставит маркетинговый и информационный контент всему сообществу, и таким образом, каждый сможет идти и искать новых продавцов для рыночной платформы!</p><h6 id=\"--7\">Новый механизм голосования сообщества</h6><p>Приложение для холодного стейкинга Partyman недавно было обновлено новыми возможностями для голосования. Эта система голосования более конфиденциальна и надежна по сравнению со встроенной системой предложений в Particl Desktop. Более подробно о том, как использовать эту систему голосования и как она будет использоваться для управления Фондом сообщества - вскоре будет опубликовано на <a href=\"https://particl.news\">Particl.news</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/01/ez8qsrnY.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/ez8qsrnY.jpeg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/01/ez8qsrnY.jpeg 1000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>До выхода первой версии Particl Desktop 3.0 еще несколько недель, но ожидание того стоит!

Доказательством может служить то, что его часто форкали  и адаптировали другие проекты с открытым исходным кодом в качестве их основного кошелька.<br><br>Но всему свое время. Учтите также, что приложению Particl Desktop уже исполнилось почти три года, и за это время команда приобрела большой опыт и знания.<br><br>Возможно приложение Particl Desktop было идеальным как для простого кошелька криптовалюты и так для ранних версий торговой площадки, но оно начало проявлять ограниченность в возможностях при тестировании  некоторых новых амбициозных функций и возможностей, таких как мульти-рынки (Multi-Markets).<br><br>Итак, поскольку для работы над версией Multi-Markets уже требовалось проделать очень много работы как с кодовой базой самой торговой площадки, так и с Desktop приложением, то команда Particl решила полностью перекодировать их и поднять на новый уровень. Таким образом, все компоненты Particl Desktop, и большая часть кодовой базы торговой площадки Particl Marketplace, были значительно улучшены, и теперь поддерживаются новой и гораздо более современной кодовой базой.<br>Вот почему следующая версия Particl Desktop теперь будет иметь номер Particl Desktop 3.0.0 вместо 2.4.0.</p><h6 id=\"--3\">Добавлено больше возможностей, чем планировалось изначально‌‌</h6><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2021/01/o7SPtSdQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2021/01/o7SPtSdQ.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2021/01/o7SPtSdQ.png 1000w, /glink/2021/01/o7SPtSdQ.png 1290w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Ви<i>д панели инструментов пользователя Particl Marketplace в Particl Desktop 3.0</i></figcaption></figure><p>В ходе этого процесса перекодировки также стало очевидно, что некоторые ключевые функции торговой площадки, изначально запланированные на будущее, могут быть интегрированы в новую кодовую базу уже сейчас.

Команда Particl выбрала именно этот путь, чтобы качество разработанных приложений всегда оставалось в приоритете.</p><p>По этой причине выпуск версии Multi-Markets был немного отложен, сравнительно с изначально ожидаемыми сроками. Но эта задержка того стоила, так как это дало команде возможность создать потрясающий продукт, который изменит правила игры в децентрализованной электронной коммерции.</p><h3 id=\"-particl-desktop-3-0\">Что нового в Particl Desktop 3.0</h3><p>Particl Desktop V2 скоро пойдет на пенсию и новорожденная V3 займет его место! В этой версии изменен не только номер, но также и весь внутренний код Desktop приложения, а также добавлено несколько функций. Это, пожалуй, самое большое обновление Particl Desktop с момента запуска основной сети.</p><p>Вот несколько примеров из того, что мы увидим в Particl Desktop 3.0:</p><h6 id=\"-particl-desktop\">Улучшения Particl Desktop</h6><ul><li>Гораздо более легкое, быстрое, быстрее откликающееся и современное Desktop приложение</li><li>Модульный подход. Кошельки, торговая площадка, обменник через атомарные свопы и чат будут разделены на отдельные, независимые модули.</li><li>Все модули, включая торговую площадку, будут включены по умолчанию при начальном запуске (после установки).</li><li>Значительно улучшенный пользовательский интерфейс, более интуитивный и удобный</li><li>Почти бесчисленное количество исправлений ошибок, улучшений и настроек для многих элементов кошелька и торговой площадки (большое спасибо всему сообществу Particl за ценные отзывы ❤️)</li><li>Капитальный ремонт интерфейса встроенного модуля обмена криптовалют</li><li>Desktop приложение с поддержкой SDK (инструментов разработчика)</li></ul><h6 id=\"--4\">Улучшения торговой площадки</h6><ul><li>Добавление новой панели управления торговой площадкой с расширенными уведомлениями и быстрым доступом к основным разделам вашей учетной записи</li><li>Добавление multi-markets и возможности создавать бесконечное количество пользовательских рынков и магазинов</li><li>Добавление браузера пользовательских рынков и магазинов с возможностью просматра и присоединения к любому из них. Также их можно рекламировать в этом браузере.</li><li>Улучшения в разделе Вопросов и Ответов по размещению товара - более легкий доступ и более подробные объяснения</li><li>Добавление идентификаторов пользователей и профилей. Теперь пользователи могут создавать бесконечное количество уникальных идентификаторов и затем использовать их для анонимных отзывов об успешных сделках, проведенных с кем-то определенным в прошлом. Таким образом, это позволяет продавцам и покупателям сформировать себе анонимную репутацию, если они того пожелают.</li><li>Возможность добавления продавцами собственных категорий товаров для своих рынков и магазинов</li><li>Значительное снижение платы за размещение листингов. Она будет снижена более чем на 80% от текущей стоимости. Стоимость размещения товара на Particl Marketplace будет значительно меньше 1 цента в эквиваленте PART!</li><li>Улучшения процесса взаимодействия Particl Desktop, кодовой базы Particl Marketplace и SecureMessaging протокола  друг с другом</li></ul><p><em>Примечание: Поскольку версии Particl Desktop V2 и V3 и их рыночные площадки радикально отличаются друг от друга, то и списки размещенных товаров также будут несовместимы между версиями. Другими словами, товары, размещенные в V3 не будут отображаться в V2 и наоборот. Разумеется, вы всегда сможете вернуться к торговой площадке версии V2, например чтобы выполнить какой-нибудь ещё невыполненный заказ, который у вас мог там остаться.</em></p><h3 id=\"-v3\">Что будет дальше после выпуска V3</h3><p>Версия Particl Desktop V3 станет важным шагом в выполнении дорожной карты Particl, так как она зачеркнет многие из ее элементов. Также она послужит толчком для воплощения в жизнь многих других инициатив.</p><h6 id=\"--5\">Будут добавлены новые монеты</h6><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2021/01/sCfRTz6Q.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2021/01/sCfRTz6Q.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2021/01/sCfRTz6Q.png 1000w, /glink/2021/01/sCfRTz6Q.png 1290w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Н<i>овый интерфейс встроенного модуля обмена валют в Particl Desktop V3</i></figcaption></figure><p>После запуска Particl Desktop 3.0 будет добавлено больше различных криптовалют во встроенный модуль обмена. Это будет хорошей возможностью показать миру чем была занята команда Particl в последние несколько месяцев, так как поможет проекту заявить о себе в различных криптовалютных сообществах.</p><h6 id=\"-2-\">Система зашифрованных сообщений (е2ее чат)</h6><p>В настоящее время DeMarkets.io разрабатывает полностью р2р локализованную систему обмена зашифрованными сообщениями, которая позволит вам общаться конфиденциально с кем угодно в мире. Независимо от того, является ли этот человек покупателем, продавцом или просто другом - вы сможете обмениваться защищенными сообщениями в сети Particl. Спасибо всем разработчикам DeMarkets.io за их вклад в создание этой системы децентрализованного чата! ❤</p><h6 id=\"-particl\">Академия Particl</h6><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/2021/01/QFddiCew.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2021/01/QFddiCew.jpeg 600w, /glink/2021/01/QFddiCew.jpeg 1000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Академия станет главным информационным центром Particl, где будет доступно интерактивное руководство пользователя. Оно содержит всю основную информацию и все инструкции, необходимые для использования приложений платформы Particl в полной мере. Документация будет написана таким образом чтобы ее смог понять кто угодно, и это  облегчит адаптацию новых пользователей.</p><h6 id=\"--6\">Программа привлечения и поддержки продавцов</h6><p>Программа привлечения и поддержки продавцов(VOOP) - это программа, призванная упростить процесс привлечения новых продавцов и помочь им сделать свои первые шаги в мире децентрализованной электронной коммерции. Она также предоставляет все инструменты, необходимые каждому для активного участия в нахождении новых продавцов и их присоединении к экосистеме Particl.</p><p>Для помощи и поддержки новых продавцов VOOP предоставляет дополнительные преимущества и льготы продавцам, которые решат участвовать в этой программе. К ним относятся финансирование комиссий за размещение товаров, бесплатная реклама их рынков и магазинов, доступ к VIP-каналам, персонализированная поддержка, привлечение больше внимания к ним в сообществе Particl и многие другие преимущества. Программа также предоставит маркетинговый и информационный контент всему сообществу, и таким образом, каждый сможет идти и искать новых продавцов для рыночной платформы!</p><h6 id=\"--7\">Новый механизм голосования сообщества</h6><p>Приложение для холодного стейкинга Partyman недавно было обновлено новыми возможностями для голосования. Эта система голосования более конфиденциальна и надежна по сравнению со встроенной системой предложений в Particl Desktop. Более подробно о том, как использовать эту систему голосования и как она будет использоваться для управления Фондом сообщества - вскоре будет опубликовано на <a href=\"https://particl.news\">Particl.news</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/2021/01/ez8qsrnY.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2021/01/ez8qsrnY.jpeg 600w, /glink/2021/01/ez8qsrnY.jpeg 1000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>До выхода первой версии Particl Desktop 3.0 еще несколько недель, но ожидание того стоит!

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success.
