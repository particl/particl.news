It is a\nnew major feature that allows you and anyone else to create an unlimited number\nof markets or storefronts on the Particl network and manage an unlimited number\nof identities across any of these markets through user profiles. It essentially\ntransforms Particl from a marketplace to a network of infinite marketplaces and\nseller shops.\n\nMarket Management is the biggest marketplace update ever since it launched on\nmainnet in August 2019 and will be one of the biggest building blocks of the\nentire Particl eCommerce protocol. The changes and meaning it brings to Particl\nwill shape the marketplace into a unique and powerful marketplace protocol and\nopen up endless possibilities.\n\nThe release of Market Management on mainnet will be a huge milestone in\nParticl’s lifecycle, but it will also mark the beginning of a new and exciting\n“development era” focused on making adoption of the platform as easy as\npossible. That much will be reflected in Particl’s upcoming roadmap update,\nwhich more details can be found in the last section of this Development Update.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDevelopment Update\nThis major Particl Desktop update will also introduce a few other improvements\nwhich will be explained in this Development Update. Without further ado, let’s\njump right into it!\n\nMarket Management\nThe team is still busy implementing Market Management. Most of the required work\nhas already been completed on the marketplace codebase side of things, and the\nteam is now putting the final touches on the flagging and blacklisting functions\nfor user markets and storefronts. Just like for listings, this governance\nmechanism is required for the community to be able to protect itself from\nundesirable content and vote it out. And it will behave just like when flagging\na listing too! When a certain market or storefront reaches a certain negative\nvoting threshold, it will get delisted off of the client.\n\nFollowing this, the new code will need to go through various integration tests\nto ensure it is secure and without bugs, after which the first testnet build\nwill be released for community testing.\n\nIdentities and User Profiles\nMarket Management also introduces a brand new concept — Identity Management. In\nfact, each market will be able to be created using any identity and sellers will\nbe able to manage an unlimited number of them spread across an unlimited number\nof markets through the user of user profiles.\n\nThis new marketplace function is already completed in the codebase and is now\nawaiting the completion of the remaining Market Management components before the\nintegration process can be finalized and properly tested.\n\nSMSG Network\nDue to the new changes brought forth by Market Management, the SMSG network will\nalso need a few tweaks to ensure that messages are carried properly between\ndifferent markets, storefronts, as well as the “open market”.\n\nThe required modifications are currently being worked in at this moment.\n\nSearch Function Improvements\nAnother set of improvements coming up has to do with the search function of the\nmarketplace. This is yet again due to the scope of the changes caused by Market\nManagement, as the search function will now need to be able to properly search\nfor items across different markets/storefronts. A few minor improvements to the\nsearch function will also be added to the next Particl Desktop update, which\nwill be followed by more significant improvements and additions (i.e. sort by,\nfilters, etc) in future updates.\n\nThis improvement is still being worked on at the moment and should be completed\nsoon as well.\n\nGUI and UI/UX Changes\nAs can be expected, Market Management is going to introduce a lot of changes to\nParticl Desktop’s user interface and experience. That’s because the Market\nManagement feature fundamentally changes the very nature of Particl’s\nmarketplace from a single marketplace to an entire network of marketplaces and\nseller shops.\n\nWhat that means is that, once Market Management goes live, Particl Desktop might\nlook and feel a bit different than what you’re used to. The team is still busy\npreparing the GUI for the full Market Management and user profile integrations.\n\nVisible and Accessible When First Starting the Application\nOne of the obvious changes that eventually needed to be done on Particl Desktop\nis the ability to easily start buying and selling on the marketplace without\nhaving to go through the hassle of manually creating a second wallet named\nMarket. To that effect, the team is currently integrating that function into\nParticl Desktop and it will be bundled in with the upcoming Market Management\nupdate.\n\nHow the new process will look like will work is as follow:\n\n * Users who already have a Market wallet activated will see their wallet be\n   automatically converted to fit the new marketplace structure. There is no\n   additional step to convert your Market wallet into the new marketplace\n   structure other than updating Particl Desktop.\n * Users who install Particl Desktop for the first time and looking to use the\n   marketplace will be presented with a new setup process that is clear and\n   visible and will allow the user to create both the default wallet and a\n   Market wallet at the same time.\n\nThis new way of accessing the marketplace will make it much easier for everyone\nto get started with Particl’s marketplace.\n\nGeneral Performance Improvements\nWith all of the above being said, let’s not forget that the next Particl Desktop\nupdate will also introduce several performance improvements. That’s because this\nupdate touches a majority of the marketplace codebase and refactors it with more\nefficient and “mature” processes.\n\nThe sum of all the minor improvements applied here and there will be translated\nin Particl Desktop being a little lighter and faster than it currently is. The\nmarketplace should also be even smoother to use.\n\nPerformance improvements to the marketplace and the Particl Desktop client are\ntypical whenever a new version of Particl Desktop is released, but this\nparticular update should see a relatively-more-significant-than-usual\nperformance boost.\n\nETA?\nIt is difficult to give a proper ETA for the delivery of Market Management as\nintegration tests are pretty much unpredictable and can take a shorter or longer\ntime to complete depending on the results. The very good news, though, is that\nmost of the code is now completed on the codebase level and that we are just\nabout to embark into the integration/testing phase.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpcoming 2020 Roadmap Update\nThe Particl team is also working on its new 2020 Development Roadmap which will\nbe heavily focused on the adoption of the marketplace. As Market Management is\nreleased, it will mark the end of a significant development sprint and the\nbeginning of a new one. The release of the new roadmap will be the cornerstone\nof this new phase of development.\n\nAn ETA until its release cannot be stated just yet, but it really won’t be long\nanymore. The team is currently evaluating many roadmap items and setting up the\npriorities as well as the roadmap structure before publishing it to the public.\nOne thing is certain, it’s that the new roadmap will be pretty exciting as the\nmarketplace becomes more and more mature and easy to use. This is where it gets\nvery interesting as “new user retention” becomes much better!\n\nYou can expect a few articles to be posted on Particl.news within a few days,\nwhich will eventually lead to the 2020 roadmap unveiling! As always, stay tuned\nfor more updates! ?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Development-Update--09-01-20-/1-d6f-78STDDExgcque1uOgA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"market-management-and-major-particl-desktop-upgrade-\">Market Management and Major Particl Desktop Upgrade ?</h3><p>As most of you already know by now, the Particl team is working on a pretty major update to Particl Desktop and its marketplace — Market Management.

That is thanks to a passionate team of developers and contributors who\nsimply won’t give up on the idea of private, free, and borderless eCommerce.\nThey breathe and bleed Particl, and each day they help make that vision a\nreality and make it more and more accessible to everybody.\n\nTogether, let’s go through the 2019 development timeline.

Keep in mind it doesn’t even include Particl\nCore releases! ?\n\nIndeed, one particularly impressive aspect of Particl’s development is how it\nalways keeps its codebase up-to-date with the latest Bitcoin codebase version.\nThat’s to ensure Particl’s base layer benefits from all the latest Bitcoin\nimprovements so that it can remain secure and can easily integrate any\ninnovation happening in Bitcoin’s world. Put simply, an up-to-date codebase\nmeans security, reliability, performance, and compatibility.\n\nAnd while “keeping the codebase up-to-date” may initially sound like a simple\nand almost robotic task, there’s definitely a reason barely any Bitcoin-based\n“altcoin”, if any, properly keeps its codebase up-to-date — it’s a tedious and\nquite complicated task. That’s because the upstream Bitcoin code needs to be\nmade to fit and be compatible with any added component to Particl’s codebase. It\ncouldn’t further from a simple “copy-paste process”…\n\nThis year, this translated into 19 individual core releases, a true testament to\nthe constant hard work put in by Particl’s Core Developer & Cryptographic\nResearcher Tecnovert [https://github.com/tecnovert].\n\nParticl Core Releases (19 total)\n * Jan. 1, 2019 —Particl Core 0.17.1.0\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.0]\n * Feb. 6, 2019 —Particl Core 0.17.1.2\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.2]\n * Feb. 14, 2019 —Particl Core 0.17.1.3\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.3]\n * Mar. 7, 2019 —Particl Core 0.17.1.4\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.4]\n * May 9, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.0.7\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.7]\n * Jun. 4, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.0.8\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.8]\n * Jun. 24, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.0.10\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.10]\n * Jul. 2, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.0.11\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.11]\n * Jul. 18, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.0.12\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.12]\n * Aug. 4, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.0\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.0]\n * Aug. 8, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.1\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.1]\n * Aug. 12, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.2\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.2]\n * Aug. 22, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.3\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.3]\n * Sep. 3, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.4\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.4]\n * Sep. 26, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.5\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.5]\n * Oct. 29, 2019 —Particl Core 0.19.0.1 RC2 (Pre-Release)\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1rc2]\n * Oct. 31, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.6\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.6]\n * Dec. 4, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.7 (Pre-Release)\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.7]\n * Dec. 3, 2019 —Particl Core 0.19.0.1 (Pre-Release)\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Around the World\nAnother great move by Particl in 2019 was to increase its boots-on-the-ground\npresence by attending, sponsoring, and presenting at several blockchain\nconferences, events, and meetups all around the world.\n\nSome of Particl’s team after SFBW’s Epicenter conferenceBlockchain events are\nideal networking opportunities for teams to find each other, build\nrelationships, and start collaborating on multiple fronts. In that sense, they\nare the perfect “matchmakers”.\n\nAs such, the Particl team has made a lot of key connections with individuals and\nteams that will help the project make the jump from an almost exclusively\ndevelopment focused project to one putting much more focus into the user\nadoption of its platform.\n\nIt’s very important to understand one thing, though, is that these relationships\nbuilt at blockchain events can take some time until they start yielding visible\nresults. Most of the time, it takes many dozens of work hours and conference\ncalls before things fall into place and start moving ahead. The best example of\nthis concept is with the addition of Spend.com [https://spend.com]’s President,\nBryan Woods, as new eCommerce strategic advisor for Particl.\n\nParticl Welcomes Spend.com President as New Advisor\n[https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-spend-com-president-as-new-advisor-7afcce8c7d71]\nBryan Woods — eCommerce Strategy and Adoption ?particl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-spend-com-president-as-new-advisor-7afcce8c7d71]\n\nThe Particl team met with Bryan at Consensus 2019, in May, and only started\ntalking about it more publicly when it was announced at SFBW’s Epicenter, in\nNovember, that he would be joining Particl’s advisory board. Still to this day,\nit is too early to reveal any of what’s being worked on with him even though\nit’s been in the works for quite some time now.\n\nDr. Kap Talking at SFBW’s EpicenterThe bottom line is that these blockchain\nevents are great to make valuable connections that, over time, will come back\nhelping the project tremendously. The team is currently in active talks with\nmany people and projects met at conferences and it should yield more visible\nresults later on in 2020.\n\nPut simply, some of the best decisions taken by the Particl team in 2019 was to\nattend Consensus and the San Francisco Blockchain Week (SFBW).\n\n2019 Conferences and Events\n * Feb. 4, 2019 —Particl in Paris — CoinHouse\n   [https://particl.news/particl-in-paris-presentations-at-coinhouse-a38106cdd36a] \n    ??\n * Mar. 13–14, 2019 —Particl in Hong Kong — Token2049\n   [https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b] \n    ??\n * May 11–12, 2019 —Particl in NYC — Magical Crypto Conference\n   [https://particl.news/particl-in-nyc-magical-crypto-conference-2019-459c1f868522] \n    ??\n * May 13–15, 2019 —Particl in NYC — Consensus\n   [https://particl.news/particl-in-nyc-consensus-2019-3f6671bd2aa6] ??\n * June 25–26, 2019 —Particl in San Francisco — Bitcoin2019\n   [https://particl.news/particl-in-san-francisco-bitcoin2019-571fe31fe396] ??\n * Oct. 28–29, 2019 —Particl in Vegas — Money2020\n   [https://particl.news/particl-world-tour-2019-f6e3d3c7e09c] ??\n * Oct. 30, 2019 —Particl in Vegas — World Crypto Conference\n   [https://particl.news/particl-world-tour-2019-f6e3d3c7e09c] ??\n * Oct. 28-Nov. 3, 2019 —Particl in San Francisco — SFBW\n   [https://particl.news/particl-in-san-francisco-sfbw-2019-bdaf0426349a] ??\n * Nov. 14, 2019 —Particl in Singapore — Blockshow\n   [https://particl.news/particl-world-tour-2019-f6e3d3c7e09c] ??\n * Nov. 21–22, 2019 —Particl in Finland — Slush Helsinki\n   [https://particl.news/particl-in-finland-slush-helsinki-1383c1d083c3] ??\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat Can We Take Back From 2019?\nLast year was a year of straight-up delivery with both Particl’s long-awaited\nOpen Marketplace and RingCT (with Bulletproofs) going live on mainnet. More\nimportantly, 2019 will forever be the year where private, free, and borderless\neCommerce became a reality for everyone. A very important milestone in human\ncommerce’s history when you think of it…\n\nIt’s also a year where it became obvious that simply pushing innovative and\nunique blockchain code just doesn’t cut it alone for a project to see great\nsuccess and get decent exposure. And that’s okay, even great, because it signals\nthat the industry is becoming more mature and wants to see blockchain products\nfinally get some “real-world adoption”. That’s the metaphorical “blockchain\nkiller product”, and that’s precisely why Particl is bound to shine moving\nforward!\n\nIn fact, the Open Marketplace is a unique offering — it offers unmatched privacy\nin eCommerce and allows sellers and buyers to connect directly and safely\ntransact by paying almost no fee at all. It takes third-parties (marketplace\noperator, payment processor, web host, etc) totally out of the eCommerce process\nand secures the user’s data and personal information at every step of the way, a\nperk that’s definitely becoming more and more valuable in an era of\never-increasing data mining, breaches, and identity thefts\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/08/20/data-breaches-expose-41-billion-records-in-first-six-months-of-2019/#59551d93bd54]\n.\n\nParticl’s Adoption\nYet, the level of adoption of the marketplace is still relatively low at this\nmoment, a surprising fact for some. That’s due to a few reasons both internal\nand external to Particl, and luckily none of these reasons should really sound\nthe alarm bell.\n\nSome of these reasons are directly due to Particl itself. In fact, the Open\nMarketplace is still very much an early Beta software and is simply not ready\nfor mass adoption just yet. After all, it more than clearly says so in the\nmarketplace’s header banner on Particl Desktop.\n\nAs a matter of fact, some of the processes as well as the user interface of the\nmarketplace are still relatively complicated for most people to use. The\nmarketplace also lacks a few important features usually expected by either\nbuyers or sellers on traditional online marketplaces. In reality, any\nsignificant amount of money invested towards aggressive user adoption campaigns\nwould more than likely result in a poor user adoption rates simply due to the\nearliness of Particl’s product. Getting people to peek around is one thing,\ngetting them to become Particl marketplace users is another thing entirely.\n\nSome of the reasons are also external to Particl. For example, the more than\ntwo-year-long cryptocurrency “bear market” surely hasn’t really encouraged\nlong-term cryptocurrency holders to spend their coins the same way a “bull\nmarket” would…\n\nA New Roadmap is on the Way\nThe very good news is that the Particl team is very aware of its marketplace’s\nbottlenecks! With Market Management, a very major marketplace update, coming out\nin a few weeks, it will mark the completion of a very high-level overview of\nwhat the marketplace was initially imagined to be — an open eCommerce network\npopulated by an infinite amount of markets. In other words, the release of\nMarket Management marks the end of a very particular development phase for the\nproject.\n\nThat being said, that also means that it marks the very beginning of a new\ndevelopment phase, one that will be all about building the right features and\ntools for its targeted users. This new phase will also be all about increasing\nthe marketplace’s accessibility, ease of use, and user interface as much as\npossible. In simple terms, this new phase is all about eliminating any reason\nwhy most people would not buy and/or sell on Particl.\n\nBuckle Up!\nIn the next few days, multiple blog posts will be published on Particl.news\n[http://Particl.news]. They will be a deep dive into the marketplace’s current\nstatus, its level of adoption, and current bottlenecks. They will also explain,\nin detail, the reasoning behind the Particl team’s strategy moving forward as it\njumps in this new decade with both feet. This mini blog post series will\nultimately culminate with the exciting reveal of the new Particl roadmap! Get\nready, as the new roadmap is more than likely to blow a few people’s minds! ?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Particl team would love to thank you all for being part of this very special\nproject and wishes you a very fruitful new decade.

Keep in mind it doesn’t even include Particl Core releases! ?</p><p>Indeed, one particularly impressive aspect of Particl’s development is how <strong>it always keeps its codebase up-to-date with the latest Bitcoin codebase version</strong>. That’s to ensure Particl’s base layer benefits from all the latest Bitcoin improvements so that it can remain secure and can easily integrate any innovation happening in Bitcoin’s world. Put simply, an up-to-date codebase means <strong>security</strong>, <strong>reliability</strong>, <strong>performance</strong>, and <strong>compatibility</strong>.</p><p>And while “keeping the codebase up-to-date” may initially sound like a simple and almost robotic task, there’s definitely a reason barely any Bitcoin-based “altcoin”, if any, properly keeps its codebase up-to-date — it’s a tedious and quite complicated task. That’s because the upstream Bitcoin code needs to be made to fit and be compatible with any added component to Particl’s codebase. It couldn’t further from a simple “copy-paste process”…</p><p>This year, this translated into <strong>19 individual core releases</strong>, a true testament to the constant hard work put in by Particl’s Core Developer &amp; Cryptographic Researcher <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert\"><strong>Tecnovert</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"particl-core-releases-19-total-\">Particl Core Releases (19 total)</h3><ul><li>Jan. 1, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.0\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.0</strong></a></li><li>Feb. 6, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.2\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.2</strong></a></li><li>Feb. 14, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.3\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.3</strong></a></li><li>Mar. 7, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.4\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.4</strong></a></li><li>May 9, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.7\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.7</strong></a></li><li>Jun. 4, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.8\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.8</strong></a></li><li>Jun. 24, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.10\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.10</strong></a></li><li>Jul. 2, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.11\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.11</strong></a></li><li>Jul. 18, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.12\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.12</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 4, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.0\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.0</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 8, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.1\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.1</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 12, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.2\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.2</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 22, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.3\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.3</strong></a></li><li>Sep. 3, 2019 —<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.4\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.4</strong></a></li><li>Sep. 26, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.5\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.5</strong></a></li><li>Oct. 29, 2019 —<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1rc2\"> <strong>Particl Core 0.19.0.1 RC2 (Pre-Release)</strong></a></li><li>Oct. 31, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.6\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.6</strong></a></li><li>Dec. 4, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.7\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.7 (Pre-Release)</strong></a></li><li>Dec. 3, 2019 —<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1\"><strong>Particl Core 0.19.0.1 (Pre-Release)</strong></a></li></ul><hr><h2 id=\"particl-around-the-world\">Particl Around the World</h2><p>Another great move by Particl in 2019 was to increase its boots-on-the-ground presence by attending, sponsoring, and presenting at several blockchain conferences, events, and meetups all around the world.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-s-2019-Year-in-Review/1-Gbg9aHfYJ9bhiThjAvvKwQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Some of Particl’s team after SFBW’s Epicenter conference</figcaption></figure><p>Blockchain events are ideal networking opportunities for teams to find each other, build relationships, and start collaborating on multiple fronts. In that sense, they are the perfect “matchmakers”.</p><p>As such, the Particl team has made a lot of key connections with individuals and teams that will help the project make the jump from an almost exclusively development focused project to one putting much more focus into the user adoption of its platform.</p><p>It’s very important to understand one thing, though, is that these relationships built at blockchain events can take some time until they start yielding visible results. Most of the time, it takes many dozens of work hours and conference calls before things fall into place and start moving ahead. The best example of this concept is with the addition of <a href=\"https://spend.com\"><strong>Spend.com</strong></a><strong>’s President, Bryan Woods</strong>, as new eCommerce strategic advisor for Particl.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-spend-com-president-as-new-advisor-7afcce8c7d71\"><strong>Particl Welcomes Spend.com President as New Advisor</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-spend-com-president-as-new-advisor-7afcce8c7d71\"><em>Bryan Woods — eCommerce Strategy and Adoption ?</em>particl.news</a></p><p>The Particl team met with Bryan at Consensus 2019, in May, and only started talking about it more publicly when it was announced at SFBW’s Epicenter, in November, that he would be joining Particl’s advisory board.

More importantly, 2019 will forever be the year where private, free, and borderless eCommerce became a reality for everyone. A very important milestone in human commerce’s history when you think of it…</p><p>It’s also a year where it became obvious that simply pushing innovative and unique blockchain code just doesn’t cut it alone for a project to see great success and get decent exposure. And that’s okay, even great, because it signals that the industry is becoming more mature and wants to see blockchain products finally get some “real-world adoption”. That’s the metaphorical “blockchain killer product”, and <strong>that’s precisely why Particl is bound to shine moving forward!</strong></p><p>In fact, the Open Marketplace is a unique offering — it offers <strong>unmatched privacy in eCommerce</strong> and <strong>allows sellers and buyers to connect directly and safely transact by paying almost no fee at all</strong>. It takes third-parties (marketplace operator, payment processor, web host, etc) totally out of the eCommerce process and secures the user’s data and personal information at every step of the way, a perk that’s definitely becoming more and more valuable in <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/08/20/data-breaches-expose-41-billion-records-in-first-six-months-of-2019/#59551d93bd54\"><strong>an era of ever-increasing data mining, breaches, and identity thefts</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"particl-s-adoption\">Particl’s Adoption</h3><p>Yet, the level of adoption of the marketplace is still relatively low at this moment, a surprising fact for some. That’s due to a few reasons both internal and external to Particl, and luckily none of these reasons should really sound the alarm bell.</p><p><strong>Some of these reasons are directly due to Particl itself</strong>. In fact, the Open Marketplace is still very much an <strong>early Beta software</strong> and is simply not ready for mass adoption just yet. After all, it more than clearly says so in the marketplace’s header banner on Particl Desktop.</p><p>As a matter of fact, some of the processes as well as the user interface of the marketplace are still relatively complicated for most people to use. The marketplace also lacks a few important features usually expected by either buyers or sellers on traditional online marketplaces. In reality, any significant amount of money invested towards aggressive user adoption campaigns would more than likely result in a poor user adoption rates simply due to the earliness of Particl’s product. Getting people to peek around is one thing, getting them to become Particl marketplace users is another thing entirely.</p><p><strong>Some of the reasons are also external to Particl</strong>. For example, the more than two-year-long cryptocurrency “bear market” surely hasn’t really encouraged long-term cryptocurrency holders to spend their coins the same way a “bull market” would…</p><h2 id=\"a-new-roadmap-is-on-the-way\">A New Roadmap is on the Way</h2><p>The very good news is that the Particl team is very aware of its marketplace’s bottlenecks! With Market Management, a very major marketplace update, coming out in a few weeks, it will mark the completion of a very high-level overview of what the marketplace was initially imagined to be — an open eCommerce network populated by an infinite amount of markets. In other words, the release of Market Management marks the end of a very particular development phase for the project.</p><p>That being said, that also means that it marks the very beginning of a new development phase, one that will be all about building the right features and tools for its targeted users. This new phase will also be all about increasing the marketplace’s accessibility, ease of use, and user interface as much as possible. <strong>In simple terms, this new phase is all about eliminating any reason why most people would not buy and/or sell on Particl.</strong></p><h3 id=\"buckle-up-\">Buckle Up!</h3><p>In the next few days, multiple blog posts will be published on <a href=\"http://Particl.news\"><strong>Particl.news</strong></a>. They will be a deep dive into the marketplace’s current status, its level of adoption, and current bottlenecks. They will also explain, in detail, the reasoning behind the Particl team’s strategy moving forward as it jumps in this new decade with both feet. <strong>This mini blog post series will ultimately culminate with the exciting reveal of the new Particl roadmap! </strong>Get ready, as the new roadmap is more than likely to blow a few people’s minds! ?</p><hr><p>The Particl team would love to thank you all for being part of this very special project and wishes you a very fruitful new decade.

Keep in mind it doesn’t even include Particl Core releases! ?</p><p>Indeed, one particularly impressive aspect of Particl’s development is how <strong>it always keeps its codebase up-to-date with the latest Bitcoin codebase version</strong>. That’s to ensure Particl’s base layer benefits from all the latest Bitcoin improvements so that it can remain secure and can easily integrate any innovation happening in Bitcoin’s world. Put simply, an up-to-date codebase means <strong>security</strong>, <strong>reliability</strong>, <strong>performance</strong>, and <strong>compatibility</strong>.</p><p>And while “keeping the codebase up-to-date” may initially sound like a simple and almost robotic task, there’s definitely a reason barely any Bitcoin-based “altcoin”, if any, properly keeps its codebase up-to-date — it’s a tedious and quite complicated task. That’s because the upstream Bitcoin code needs to be made to fit and be compatible with any added component to Particl’s codebase. It couldn’t further from a simple “copy-paste process”…</p><p>This year, this translated into <strong>19 individual core releases</strong>, a true testament to the constant hard work put in by Particl’s Core Developer &#x26; Cryptographic Researcher <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert\"><strong>Tecnovert</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"particl-core-releases-19-total-\">Particl Core Releases (19 total)</h3><ul><li>Jan. 1, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.0\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.0</strong></a></li><li>Feb. 6, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.2\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.2</strong></a></li><li>Feb. 14, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.3\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.3</strong></a></li><li>Mar. 7, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.4\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.4</strong></a></li><li>May 9, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.7\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.7</strong></a></li><li>Jun. 4, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.8\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.8</strong></a></li><li>Jun. 24, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.10\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.10</strong></a></li><li>Jul. 2, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.11\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.11</strong></a></li><li>Jul. 18, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.12\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.12</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 4, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.0\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.0</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 8, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.1\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.1</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 12, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.2\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.2</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 22, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.3\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.3</strong></a></li><li>Sep. 3, 2019 —<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.4\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.4</strong></a></li><li>Sep. 26, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.5\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.5</strong></a></li><li>Oct. 29, 2019 —<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1rc2\"> <strong>Particl Core 0.19.0.1 RC2 (Pre-Release)</strong></a></li><li>Oct. 31, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.6\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.6</strong></a></li><li>Dec. 4, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.7\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.7 (Pre-Release)</strong></a></li><li>Dec. 3, 2019 —<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1\"><strong>Particl Core 0.19.0.1 (Pre-Release)</strong></a></li></ul><hr><h2 id=\"particl-around-the-world\">Particl Around the World</h2><p>Another great move by Particl in 2019 was to increase its boots-on-the-ground presence by attending, sponsoring, and presenting at several blockchain conferences, events, and meetups all around the world.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-2019-Year-in-Review/1-Gbg9aHfYJ9bhiThjAvvKwQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Some of Particl’s team after SFBW’s Epicenter conference</figcaption></figure><p>Blockchain events are ideal networking opportunities for teams to find each other, build relationships, and start collaborating on multiple fronts.

Most of the time, it takes many dozens of work hours and conference calls before things fall into place and start moving ahead.

More importantly, 2019 will forever be the year where private, free, and borderless eCommerce became a reality for everyone. A very important milestone in human commerce’s history when you think of it…</p><p>It’s also a year where it became obvious that simply pushing innovative and unique blockchain code just doesn’t cut it alone for a project to see great success and get decent exposure. And that’s okay, even great, because it signals that the industry is becoming more mature and wants to see blockchain products finally get some “real-world adoption”. That’s the metaphorical “blockchain killer product”, and <strong>that’s precisely why Particl is bound to shine moving forward!</strong></p><p>In fact, the Open Marketplace is a unique offering — it offers <strong>unmatched privacy in eCommerce</strong> and <strong>allows sellers and buyers to connect directly and safely transact by paying almost no fee at all</strong>. It takes third-parties (marketplace operator, payment processor, web host, etc) totally out of the eCommerce process and secures the user’s data and personal information at every step of the way, a perk that’s definitely becoming more and more valuable in <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/08/20/data-breaches-expose-41-billion-records-in-first-six-months-of-2019/#59551d93bd54\"><strong>an era of ever-increasing data mining, breaches, and identity thefts</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"particl-s-adoption\">Particl’s Adoption</h3><p>Yet, the level of adoption of the marketplace is still relatively low at this moment, a surprising fact for some. That’s due to a few reasons both internal and external to Particl, and luckily none of these reasons should really sound the alarm bell.</p><p><strong>Some of these reasons are directly due to Particl itself</strong>. In fact, the Open Marketplace is still very much an <strong>early Beta software</strong> and is simply not ready for mass adoption just yet. After all, it more than clearly says so in the marketplace’s header banner on Particl Desktop.</p><p>As a matter of fact, some of the processes as well as the user interface of the marketplace are still relatively complicated for most people to use. The marketplace also lacks a few important features usually expected by either buyers or sellers on traditional online marketplaces. In reality, any significant amount of money invested towards aggressive user adoption campaigns would more than likely result in a poor user adoption rates simply due to the earliness of Particl’s product. Getting people to peek around is one thing, getting them to become Particl marketplace users is another thing entirely.</p><p><strong>Some of the reasons are also external to Particl</strong>. For example, the more than two-year-long cryptocurrency “bear market” surely hasn’t really encouraged long-term cryptocurrency holders to spend their coins the same way a “bull market” would…</p><h2 id=\"a-new-roadmap-is-on-the-way\">A New Roadmap is on the Way</h2><p>The very good news is that the Particl team is very aware of its marketplace’s bottlenecks! With Market Management, a very major marketplace update, coming out in a few weeks, it will mark the completion of a very high-level overview of what the marketplace was initially imagined to be — an open eCommerce network populated by an infinite amount of markets. In other words, the release of Market Management marks the end of a very particular development phase for the project.</p><p>That being said, that also means that it marks the very beginning of a new development phase, one that will be all about building the right features and tools for its targeted users. This new phase will also be all about increasing the marketplace’s accessibility, ease of use, and user interface as much as possible. <strong>In simple terms, this new phase is all about eliminating any reason why most people would not buy and/or sell on Particl.</strong></p><h3 id=\"buckle-up-\">Buckle Up!</h3><p>In the next few days, multiple blog posts will be published on <a href=\"http://Particl.news\"><strong>Particl.news</strong></a>. They will be a deep dive into the marketplace’s current status, its level of adoption, and current bottlenecks. They will also explain, in detail, the reasoning behind the Particl team’s strategy moving forward as it jumps in this new decade with both feet. <strong>This mini blog post series will ultimately culminate with the exciting reveal of the new Particl roadmap! </strong>Get ready, as the new roadmap is more than likely to blow a few people’s minds! ?</p><hr><p>The Particl team would love to thank you all for being part of this very special project and wishes you a very fruitful new decade.

This update introduces a lot of improvements to the\nstartup and shut down processes of Particl Desktop and introduces a few minor\nUI/UX tweaks. While this update does not introduce any new feature, it makes\nParticl Desktop more stable and should go a long way in eliminating a lot of\nissues some users get from time to time when launching the application.\n\n)The entire Particl team would also like to take this opportunity to wish\neveryone in the Particl community a merry Christmas and some wonderful holidays! \nWe highly recommend resting during this period, because 2020 is going to be a\nglorious year for the Particl project and one filled with new objectives and\ngoals!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started\nDownload Particl Desktop 2.3.2: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.2\n\nparticl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.2]\nYou can't perform that action at this time.

The marketplace is currently only available via the\nParticl Desktop on this wallet. This is a temporary requirement that is going to\nbe improved with the upcoming Market Management\n[https://particl.news/market-management-is-next-3e35356d5de0] feature.\n\nNotes\n * There will be an automatic update to the latest supported particl-core\n   version, if applicable, when the marketplace is launched.\n * Your wallet needs to be unlocked in order to process buy and sell orders on\n   the open marketplace, if the wallet is encrypted.\n * The marketplace is still in on-going development, and thus is considered to\n   be a Beta release.\n * NB!! The source code linked to here is not the actual tagged release source\n   code. Please contact Particl for source code information. The actual source\n   code will be uploaded and made available after an appropriate interval of\n   time has passed.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s New?\nUI/UX Tweaks\n * Status messages are now displayed on the loading screen when starting up the\n   application and switching between wallets. This should provide an indicator\n   that the startup is proceeding, or that an error has occurred if something\n   fails during startup.\n * A closing modal is now displayed during the shutdown process while the\n   application is shutting down.\n\nFixed Issues\n * The application startup now checks for a running daemon before validating\n   local particl-core binaries or even checking for valid versions. Fixes a long\n   standing problem described in #892\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues/892]\n * Fixes the regression with particl core cookie files: the application now\n   properly determines when to read the daemon cookie file.\n * Application startup is no longer dependent on timers polling for various\n   states of activity. This should allow for minor startup performance\n   improvements in many cases.\n * Application shutdown now properly waits for the running daemon to close\n   before closing the visual user interface. This removes the need to try\n   estimate the waiting time of the application shut down, before it can be\n   restarted, which is a particularly annoying issue on Windows. Fixes issues\n   related to #1624 [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues/1624]\n * The running application’s taskbar icon is now removed immediately when the\n   application begins shutting down, preventing a number of errors in attempting\n   to make use of it while the shutdown process continues. See #1598\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues/1598] as an example.\n * A single state application instance has been introduced: this means that the\n   application no longer breaks in many cases when attempting to start more than\n   one instance at a time.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model.

the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
