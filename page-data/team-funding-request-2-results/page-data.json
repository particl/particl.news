Much like last week, the progress made to the desktop client has been\nrelated to bug fixes and general improvements. While working on the current\nissues, additional bugs or unintended behaviors have been discovered and will be\nincluded in the next release.\n\nAs such, we are currently finalizing the release of Particl Desktop 3.1.1, which\nshould go live in the next few days. Keep your eyes on Particl News for its\nrelease blog post!\n\n> Note: We'd like to let you know that we expect next week to be a less\ndevelopment-intensive one.

We're happy to report that we'll be ready to release\nParticl Desktop 3.1.1 in the coming days, likely next week.\n\nThis release will cover the most pressing fixes and allow the team to focus more\nexclusively on the new functionalities planned for Particl Desktop 3.2 such as\nin-market messaging (buyer <> seller).\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Report\nEarlier this week, Particl Core 0.19.0.19\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.19] has been fully\nreleased. This is an important Particl Core update that makes the 0.19 codebase\ncompatible with Taproot\n[https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-taproot-and-how-it-will-benefit-bitcoin]\n.\n\nRelease Particl Core 0.19.2.19 · particl/particl-coreRelease\nNotes:https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019219Hashes6b240634cbf589cfc26266bdb73a546bb35449b23fdb5ae052005f9ae9335b1e\nparticl-0.19.2.19-aarch...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.19]As a reminder,\nParticl is going to hardfork on the 1st of February at 17:00 UTC to activate the\nTaproot protocol and fix an issue with the dynamic marketplace listing fees.\nCheck out this article [https://particl.news/february-2022-hardfork/] to learn\nmore about the upcoming hardfork.\n\nTaproot Hardfork Announcement (February 2022)Learn everything you need to know\nabout Particl’s upcoming hardfork and prepare ahead with Particl Core\n0.19.2.18.\nParticl Newscryptoguard [https://particl.news/february-2022-hardfork/]The rest\nof the week has been spent working and making progress on both BasicSwap\n[https://particl.news/introducing-particls-basicswap-dex/]'s backend code as\nwell as its GUI. And on that note, we'd like to respond to the few questions\nwe've had this week related to the launch of BasicSwap's open beta.\n\nAs most of you know, BasicSwap is currently in its closed beta phase\n[https://particl.news/introducing-particls-basicswap-dex/]. What this means is\nthat it's currently being tested, on mainnet, by a closed group of beta testers.\nOnce we open the beta to the public, it'll then be possible for anyone to test\nit out on their own and swap cryptocurrencies with others.\n\nHowever, there are a few requirements for this to happen. First, BasicSwap's\ninitial user interface has to be completed. That's because the current version\nof BasicSwap is mostly dedicated to advanced users and may be difficult to\nnavigate through for some users. Secondly, there are still a few backend\nimprovements, including the setup process, that are in the works to make the\nplatform more user-friendly and stable. \n\nThese requirements are necessary to make BasicSwap more accessible and reduce\nthe time cost of troubleshooting issues with beta testers. In other words, it\nmakes public testing of the DEX more efficient. Once these are complete, we'll\nbe ready to launch the open beta phase of BasicSwap. \n\nDon't worry, we'll announce it in advance so that you can tell other people to\ncome to try it out!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe thank you all for your passion, dedication, and valuable contributions to the\nParticl project; you are what makes Particl possible!\n\nWhether you actively work on expanding the ecosystem or simply use the\nmarketplace and send your feedback to the team, every bit helps shaping the\nfuture of de-commerce (decentralized e-commerce) and easing its adoption!\n\nWe wish you a great weekend and we'll see you, like always, back on Monday ?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
