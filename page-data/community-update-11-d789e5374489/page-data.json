Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\nWhen is the RingCT and governance hardfork is going to happen?\nThere is no official date set for it yet, and the plan to combine RingCT and\ngovernance into the same hardfork hasn’t changed since we last spoke about it.\nTecnovert is still working on some RingCT improvements on stability,\nperformance, and security, and wants to complete those before releasing it on\nmainnet. He did start to officially work on the Bulletproofs implementation and\nso it is likely that it will hit mainnet WITH bulletproofs included.\n\nDoes the Particl team plans on integrating a lock-up time for PART coins when\nthey are unlocked for staking so that coins are locked for a longer time and\ncan’t be moved/staked/sold before your node finds a block?\nIn short, it is not an immediate issue we are targeting. While this might be a\ngood idea, in theory, to make it more difficult for people to accumulate coins\nand then misuse them to attack the project by abusing the Proof-of-Stake\nprotocol, such as measure would likely severely handicap Particl as a currency.\nThis isn’t to say that a similar measure won’t ever be considered or\nimplemented, after all, Particl is all about security, but right now the focus\nis mostly on Particl Marketplace and Particl Desktop. It’s important to note\nthat we have a Research & Development team constantly putting up to test,\nresearching, and evaluating the many solutions popping up all over the industry,\nmeaning that our team is pro-actively putting your security at the highest\npriority.\n\nOne interesting dynamics related to this question specifically is how Particl\nMarketplace’s escrow mechanism, which is based on the MAD game-theory and\nrequires double security deposits from both vendors and buyers, will actually\nlock some of the supply out of circulation. In fact, both vendors and buyers\nneed to deposit funds into an escrow smart-contract to ensure both parties’\nhonesty. This, in turn, results in a portion of the supply being locked.\nContrary to the proposed solution in this question, having some of the supply\nlocked through the marketplace’s escrow is much more organic and less intrusive,\nas everyone who’s going to contribute to this “lock up” will do so in a\nperfectly voluntary basis, as opposed to being “forced” to lock some coins up\nfor an extended period of time by the protocol. This is a scenario we believe to\nbe more fair to the users and less handicapping. Additionally, in the future,\nmore Dapps could make use of Particl’s decentralized escrow mechanism and lock\neven more supply out of circulation, especially once we release the developed\nSDK toolkit. This will make it considerably harder for attackers to acquire\nlarge sums of coins and misuse them against the network (although that behavior\nis akin to an “economic suicide” from the attacker’s standpoint).\n\nLooking at recent events with Charlie Shrem, does he have access to any\ndocumentation or internal chats?\nNo, none of our advisors have any access to internal chats and documents, except\nfor Joe Fisher which has been heavily involved with Particl Marketplace lately\n(as per his experience as a career product inventor and online seller). All of\nCharlie’s communication with the team has been done through private messages.\nLike any other company that would have one of its advisors accused of some\nmisbehavior, we’re adopting a wait and see approach to the situation, instead\ndeciding to keep a close eye on the situation rather than proceed to hasty\nconclusions. Should Charlie Shrem be recognized guilty of the allegations made\nagainst him, we will have no choice but to distance ourselves from him and his\nbrand. Until that point, we’re staying alert to the situation.\n\nWill Particl hire a market maker and make deals with bigger exchanges\nlike Binance?\nIt seems that some representative from Binance may be hanging in our community\nand chatrooms as we get some pretty pointed questions from them from times to\ntimes regarding happenings, updates, and news we publish. While in reality, this\nmay not mean anything, it is definitely a good thing for the industry in general\nthat this exchange is keeping itself super diligent. Some of their questions are\nactually pretty good and shows they really are keeping a close eye on what’s\nhappening surrounding the project.\n\nRight now, we’re mostly focused on larger exchanges such as, of course, Binance,\nbut also Coinbase, Circle, Poloniex, Bitfinex, and other similarly large\nexchanges. We do not focus on smaller exchanges that are asking for a listing\nfee and that we believe wouldn’t yield us some return (in terms of community\ngrowth) on our investment. This is directly in line with our responsible fund\nmanagement strategy and part of the reason why we are guaranteed to have funds\nfor development for at least until the end of Q1 2019 (after which an additional\nfunding round will be in sight).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nStatus Report\nParticl.io * Privacy-focused Decentralized Applications\n[http://particl.io/status-report/]\nParticl provides a decentralized privacy platform with a suite of tools to\nenhance your online privacy * Private… [http://particl.io/status-report/]\nparticl.io [http://particl.io/status-report/]\n\nAs always, a new Status Report was published at the same time we did our last\nlivestream. This report indicates a couple of items to be completed, such as \nuniformed height of listing items, drag’n’drop capability added when adding\nlistings, and proposals/votes to be based on time instead of blocks. Newly added\nto the In Development section are the governance system coin weight system, \nprivate markets, and proposal enhancements. As always, Tecnovert is still\nworking on improving the RingCT implementation with enhancements and \nBulletproofs. The current team meeting in South Africa is likely to shape future\nStatus Report and further the internal roadmap.\n\nConferences & Meetups\n> \nAs we have been saying lately, our intention is to start getting a more direct\nexposure by directly reaching out to the most passionate individuals of the\ncrypto scene by getting a better exposure at various crypto events. Nothing\nbeats the human interaction of discussing in-person the subject we are all\npassionate about!\n\n> \nOur newest team member, Lina Seiche, was specifically hired with this in mind\nand has already started integrating Particl into the blockchain presentations\nshe had already scheduled. Because she is seemingly falling in love with\nParticl, and also because of her own company, block-chats\n[https://block-chats.com/], it is to be expected that Particl will now be\nintegrated into most of their events, in some way or the other, in addition to\nthe Particl-themed events she’ll be organizing.\n\nAs such, she’s started planning the first of many future Particl-themed events.\nIn fact, on the 14th of December, Particl is going to hold its first official\nevent in Manilla, Philippines. This Christmas-themed Particl event will not only\nfocus on Particl but will also hold a panel of experts and well-known blockchain\npublic figures in that region. The panel will focus on eCommerce and why it is\nin dire need of decentralization and will be composed of leaders in the\nPhilippines blockchain industry such as:\n\n * Miguel Cuneta — Co-Founder of SCI [https://sci.ph/] & Particl Advisor\n * Mark Vernon — Founder of TagCash [https://tagcash.com/], a large\n   Philippines-based crypto company and very well-known within the Asian\n   community\n * Chris Verceles — Blockchain developer at Consensys [https://consensys.net/]\n * Colin Goltra — Head of Cryptocurrency Program at Coin.ph [https://coins.ph/]\n * Gerb Inajada — Head of Blockchain Technology at UnionBank\n   [https://www.unionbank.com/]\n * Alenna Dawn Magpantay — Philippines Ambassador for Coding Girls\n   [https://www.coding-girls.com/]\n\nFor more information about this event, please follow these links: \nhttps://block-chats.com/christmas-fair-2018/ & \nhttps://www.meetup.com/BlockChatsPhilippines/events/256492831/\n\nWe’ve also have been reaching out to our key contacts within the French\ncommunity and are planning a meetup/conference in Paris shortly. We will give\nmore information about this one at a future time.\n\nParticl Chosen to Present at the Toronto CryptoCamp Blockchain Unconference\nHome [https://www.cryptocamp.community/]\nToronto | 29.11.18 Crypto camp Get your tickets!\n[https://www.cryptocamp.community/]www.cryptocamp.community\n[https://www.cryptocamp.community/]\n\nParticl has been chosen among 80 applications to present its Particl Marketplace\nproduct at the Blockchain Unconference in Toronto on the 29th of November.\n\n> CryptoCamp is Toronto’s first-ever blockchain unconference. This\n100%-volunteer-led event aims to bring the entire blockchain community together,\nshowcase some of the most interesting products and projects, and pay it forward\nby offering Blockchain Bootcamp workshops. Organized by the community for the\ncommunity, CryptoCamp aims to grow, connect, and diversify the ecosystem. Come\nto meet other crypto-curious and crypto-scaredies, and connect with\nprofessionals working in this space. This event is for you.\nThis conference is mainly focused on two things: education, and the presentation\nof actual products making use of the blockchain technology. This event will be\nhosted at the Deloitte Office in Toronto and will take place over two entire\nfloors.\n\nThe first part of the day will be dedicated to education. In fact, many speakers\nwill give educational talks about crypto and blockchain technology in general to\na wide audience of crypto enthusiasts. The second part of the day, which is when\nwe are scheduled to present Particl Marketplace to the crowd, is focused on\nshowcasing actual blockchain products. In fact, a series of speakers will each\nbe demonstrating their blockchain products in front of experts in the field and\nexplain how they foresee it making an impact on the industry they’re each\ntargeting. With around 80 submitted applications or so, the event has chosen\nParticl as one of the projects it wants to see presented!\n\nTickets for the entire event are available at this link\n[https://www.eventbrite.com/e/crypto-camp-at-deloitte-tickets-51716842468#tickets]\n, and we hope to have the chance to meet some of you who live close to Toronto.\nThis event is organized in part by CryptoChicks, a rather well-known blockchain\ngroup in Canada, and has partnered with several key sponsors such as Deloitte,\nShyft, BlockGeeks, TWG, and many more to make it a memorable moment. If you’re\naround the area and would like to come, let us know in advance so that we can\nmeet up at some point!\n\nSee the full list of speakers here: https://www.cryptocamp.community/speakers/\n\nDevelopment Team Meeting in South Africa\nThe team is currently meeting near Elizabeth Port in South Africa for its\nquarterly meeting.

This isn’t to say that a similar measure won’t ever be considered or implemented, after all, Particl is all about security, but right now the focus is mostly on Particl Marketplace and Particl Desktop. It’s important to note that we have a Research &#x26; Development team constantly putting up to test, researching, and evaluating the many solutions popping up all over the industry, meaning that our team is pro-actively putting your security at the highest priority.</p><p>One interesting dynamics related to this question specifically is how Particl Marketplace’s escrow mechanism, which is based on the MAD game-theory and requires double security deposits from both vendors and buyers, will actually lock some of the supply out of circulation. In fact, both vendors and buyers need to deposit funds into an escrow smart-contract to ensure both parties’ honesty. This, in turn, results in a portion of the supply being locked. Contrary to the proposed solution in this question, having some of the supply locked through the marketplace’s escrow is much more organic and less intrusive, as everyone who’s going to contribute to this “lock up” will do so in a perfectly voluntary basis, as opposed to being “forced” to lock some coins up for an extended period of time by the protocol. This is a scenario we believe to be more fair to the users and less handicapping. Additionally, in the future, more Dapps could make use of Particl’s decentralized escrow mechanism and lock even more supply out of circulation, especially once we release the developed SDK toolkit. This will make it considerably harder for attackers to acquire large sums of coins and misuse them against the network (although that behavior is akin to an “economic suicide” from the attacker’s standpoint).</p><h3 id=\"looking-at-recent-events-with-charlie-shrem-does-he-have-access-to-any-documentation-or-internal-chats\">Looking at recent events with Charlie Shrem, does he have access to any documentation or internal chats?</h3><p>No, none of our advisors have any access to internal chats and documents, except for Joe Fisher which has been heavily involved with Particl Marketplace lately (as per his experience as a career product inventor and online seller). All of Charlie’s communication with the team has been done through private messages. Like any other company that would have one of its advisors accused of some misbehavior, we’re adopting a wait and see approach to the situation, instead deciding to keep a close eye on the situation rather than proceed to hasty conclusions. Should Charlie Shrem be recognized guilty of the allegations made against him, we will have no choice but to distance ourselves from him and his brand. Until that point, we’re staying alert to the situation.</p><h3 id=\"will-particl-hire-a-market-maker-and-make-deals-with-bigger-exchanges-like-binance\">Will Particl hire a market maker and make deals with bigger exchanges like Binance?</h3><p>It seems that some representative from Binance may be hanging in our community and chatrooms as we get some pretty pointed questions from them from times to times regarding happenings, updates, and news we publish. While in reality, this may not mean anything, it is definitely a good thing for the industry in general that this exchange is keeping itself super diligent. Some of their questions are actually pretty good and shows they really are keeping a close eye on what’s happening surrounding the project.</p><p>Right now, we’re mostly focused on larger exchanges such as, of course, Binance, but also Coinbase, Circle, Poloniex, Bitfinex, and other similarly large exchanges. We do not focus on smaller exchanges that are asking for a listing fee and that we believe wouldn’t yield us some return (in terms of community growth) on our investment. This is directly in line with our responsible fund management strategy and part of the reason why we are guaranteed to have funds for development for at least until the end of Q1 2019 (after which an additional funding round will be in sight).</p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &#x26; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"status-report\">Status Report</h3><p><a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\"><strong>Particl.io * Privacy-focused Decentralized Applications</strong></a><br><a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\"><em>Particl provides a decentralized privacy platform with a suite of tools to enhance your online privacy * Private…</em></a><a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\">particl.io</a></p><p>As always, a new <strong>Status Report</strong> was published at the same time we did our last livestream.

Her entrance into the blockchain industry came through her\nposition as the PR Manager and Evangelist for a Tokyo-founded cryptocurrency\nhedge fund platform where she would break down language barriers launching\nglobal roadshows and marketing activities.\nThe founder of BlockChats [https://block-chats.com/], an event, and lifestyle\ncommunity focused on education, inspiration, and international connection in and\naround the blockchain space, Lina aims to deliver unusual concepts to the\ngrowing communities around the world in order to shine a light on the\nopportunities in the industry.\nTrue to the spirit of the blockchain universe, she is a constant traveler in\nbetween countries and blockchain destinations, placing a special focus on\nemerging markets and the collaboration between communities all over the world.\nShe will still sing for you if you ask nicely, or if there’s a karaoke\nhappening.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLina’s going to be touching on a lot of stuff and be a great asset for the\nproject. Whether it be organizing events or talking at conferences, building\n“boots on the ground” communities, producing videos, helping with social media,\nor writing articles, her experience in the blockchain and business industries is\ngoing to be a game-changer for the project.\n\nLina already has a good following and community through her BlockChats\n[https://block-chats.com/] meetups (focused on blockchain education), her \nSatoshi Citadel Industries [https://sci.ph/] connections (both SCI’s founders,\nMiguel and John, are part of Particl’s advisory team), and from her continued\npresence at various blockchain events. In fact, anything event-related is going\nto be one of Lina’s core role within the team.\n\nAs such, for the month of November, she’s already scheduled to present an\neducative talk at BlockLab\n[https://block-chats.com/events/manila/blocklab-dish-edition/] on the 10th of\nNovember as well as give speeches at the DISH2018 [https://dish2018.com/] \nhackathon on the 24th and 25th of November.

There are also\na few other events we are looking for in the month of November, although none of\nthem are currently confirmed. Don’t worry, we’ll communicate any event we’ll\nhave a presence at, so stay tuned!\n\nGetting a physical presence at various blockchain events (Particl-related or\nnot) is going to go a long way in forming solid relationships with key people\nand growing our local communities. In that sense, Lina’s arrival to the team\ncouldn’t happen at a better time!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe’re really happy to see Lina join the team as well as the community, and we’re\npretty excited about what unique touch she’s going to bring to the project.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult.

In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from 6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will increase from 3% to 3.5<strong>%</strong> for the next year.
