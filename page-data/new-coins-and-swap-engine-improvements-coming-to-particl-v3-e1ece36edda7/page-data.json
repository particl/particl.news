Check out the link below to know everything about the massive\nParticl V3.0 update.\n\nStepping Things Up Again With Particl Desktop 3.0\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\nA New Breakthrough for Privacy and eCommerce ?particl.news\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nImproved Swap Engine Coming on V3 Release\nOne of the main components that’s getting a big makeover with the Particl V3\nrelease is the in-app swap engine. This module, which is available right inside\nthe Particl Desktop application, lets you easily swap other cryptocurrencies for\nPART so that you can anonymously buy or sell anything on the marketplace. This\ncan be done, without ever leaving the Particl Desktop client, by using the\nstandalone swap module which is currently being powered by partners such as \nStealthEX [https://stealthex.io] and SimpleSwap [https://simpleswap.io/].\n\nImprovements Through Better Bot Management Support\nTo explain more precisely what improvements Particl V3 will bring to the swap\nengine, Particl developer Arnold Bansemer takes the time to elaborate on the\ntopic.\n\n“The biggest part of the in-app swap engine changes is better bot management.\nBots will increasingly drive traffic onto the network and will end up playing a\nnon-trivial role in getting some external functionality into the Particl\necosystem.\n\nWhat we’re aiming to do with the ongoing changes being made to the swap engine\nis to create a set of defined functionalities and requirements for how bot info\nis received and processed which will push towards a standardized way of creating\n“legitimate” bots.\n\nUsing these requirements, the bot manager in PD will then effectively act as a\n“processing plant” for bots. The bot manager UI in the desktop will provide the\nuser with a way to manage different bots (add/remove/view details/etc). Other\napps (i.e. the marketplace) wanting to use a bot of a certain type, or provide\nbot management for a particular bot type, will interact directly with the bot\nmanager to obtain those details.”\n\nMore Robust Framework\nParticl developer Arnold Bansemer continues: “The bot manager will help ensure\nthat only those bots meeting a particular standard set of functionality are\navailable. For example, in the case of Particl’s swap module, it would only\ninquire about EXCHANGE type of bots and display the relevant information based\non context.\n\nWhen receiving a message on the bot listener address, the bot manager probes the\nbot to find out its commands, and argument types, etc. Once this is known\n(assuming we get valid data back), Particl apps (i.e. the marketplace) can start\ndoing all sorts of things like show upgrade changes, allow apps to use specific\nversions of bots, receive specific requests or data, and etc.”\n\nList of Swap Engine Improvements\nIn addition to the back-end changes being made to the bot manager, a few\nadditional improvements and goodies are being added to the swap engine itself.\n\nThe main improvements it’s receiving with the V3 release are as follow:\n\n * More coins being made available to swap\n * Completely new user interface\n * More dynamic and responsive process\n * More built-in security measures\n * Aggregated display of available offers\n\nThe sum of all these changes makes Particl’s in-app swap engine as smooth to use\nas ever. A special mention is worth giving to whoever pushed a prediction market\nSMSG bot onto the network a few weeks ago, prompting the Particl team to develop\na more robust and efficient framework for community bot management and\ndeployment.\n\nNew Coins Getting Listed on V3 Release\nParticl’s in-app swap engine (WIP and subject to change before release)To\nsupport the mainnet launch of Particl V3 along with its improved in-app swap\nengine, new coins will be added and ready to swap on the day of the release.\n\n * Monero [https://www.getmonero.org/] (XMR)\n * DAI [https://makerdao.com/en/] (MakerDAO’s stablecoin)\n * NIX [https://nixplatform.io/] (Flare Wallet)\n * USDt [https://tether.to/] (Tether stablecoin)\n * USDC [https://www.centre.io/usdc] (Circle & Coinbase stablecoin)\n\nThese coins not only make Particl as accessible as before by extending the\nnumber of cryptocurrencies that can be used on the platform, but they also\nprovide new valuable functionalities by either adding an additional privacy\nlayer (i.e. Monero) to the mix or by allowing stablecoin payments to be made\n(i.e. DAI).\n\nKeep an Eye Out for More Coins to Come\nThis is only a beginning. Following the Particl V3 mainnet release, new coins\nwill start getting added more regularly to the improved in-app swap module. This\nwill create a cascading effect of added utility, network effect, as well as\nincrease the pool of potential marketplace shoppers and sellers.\n\nThis will create a perfect storm scenario — the combination of (1) all the new\ncoins getting added to Particl, (2) the improved in-app swapping experience, and\n(3) the major impact on the overall user experience caused by the V3 release\nwill make it as easy as ever to get new people to try on Particl.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIs there any coin you’d like to see added on Particl?

Most of the screenshots are not in their\nfinal version and will be tweaked/polished before going live.\nRecently Completed and Released Items\nParticl Desktop 2.3.4\nThe Particl team released Particl Desktop 2.3.4\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.4]. This update\nadded new coin icons for use with the current in-app swap engine implementation.\nThis kind of update won’t be required with the new swap engine implementation\ncoming for Particl Desktop V3.0.\n\nParticl Desktop 2.3.5\nParticl Desktop 2.3.5The Particl team released Particl Desktop 2.3.5\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.5]. This update\nprovides a new validation to ensure that the SMSG local address used in the\nmarketplace is still registered in core. This fixes the issue where some users\ncouldn’t decrypt SMSG messages addressed to them anymore, making it impossible\nto progress in escrow without manual commands being entered in the debug window.\n\nThis update also included a visual indicator in the menu bar of the ‘market’\nwallet notifying the user that bid messages (new orders, escrow progression,\netc) cannot be processed while the wallet is locked (clicking on the indicator\nprompts for the wallet to be unlocked).\n\nImproved Discord Tipbot\nParticl developer Ludx worked on an improved Discord tipbot built from scratch.\nThis improves on the previous bot’s performance and adds features such as user\nand pool accounts, user authorization, commands to check balances, deposit and\nwithdraw, tip, giveaway, and rain. The tipbot is currently enabled on Discord.\nJust join Particl’s server [http://discord.me/particl] and type %help to get\nstarted.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProgress Report\nSell Section Layout Update (In Progress)\nIn the previous update, we mentioned that we had to make changes around how in\nthe ‘sell’ section the publishing of listings to single and multiple markets\nneeded some modifications. A rework of the layout was done for us to make the\nflow on the GUI feel seamless, where the backend needed to distinguish between\nBase templates and Market specific templates. This ensures that one could edit a\nmarket template specific to a market and save the details to be posted at a\nlater stage. The implementation of the re-worked layout is in progress.\n\nPull to Push Websocket Connection (Complete)\nIn order to improve the performance of the new 3.0 desktop application, a\nwebsocket connection to the marketplace engine allows for the Particl Desktop to\nreceive various push event notifications rather than polling for updates every\nfew seconds.\n\nMarket User Dashboard Improvements (Mostly Complete)\nMarket User Dashboard Preview (WIP)The Overview page of the market module has been recently improved on, ensuring\nall wallet info is displayed correctly. As the Sell and Buy sections of the\ndesktop application are completed, their respected section will be added to the\nOverview page. These include information like Sell and Buy page filters, new\nquestions on listings, funds locked in escrow, and various visual badges\nindicated your attention is needed somewhere.\n\nLink Listings to User Identity Instead of User Profile (Complete)\nWhile working on the Cart and Checkout integration we did pick up an issue where\nthe listings displayed in the cart were being identified at the profile level\nand this needed to be changed to the Identity level.\n\nWith the Profile as listing identifier, listings added to the cart from all\nsubscribed markets across all Identities would be displayed. This would mean\nthat continuing with the checkout, a buyer would need to pay for all items and\nmultiple wallets would need to be unlocked at a single time. For example, if the\nbuyer is browsing with Identity “A”, we ideally would want to only display\nlistings linked to that identity’s markets. This has been successfully changed\nand completed.\n\nListing Browser (In Progress)\nListings are now being created and displayed correctly with the correct\nCategories and Markets linked to them. All filtering and processing around the\nlistings are working as expected. There is still some integration left to be\ndone as other components get completed.\n\nNew Shipping Profiles section (Complete)\nEdit Shipping Profiles Page Preview (WIP)A new Shipping Profiles section for the\nmanaging of shipping addresses outside of the cart/checkout process has been\nadded to the new desktop application. This item is now complete.\n\nRefactored Market Functionalities (Complete)\nMarket Browser Preview (WIP)A bunch of core market functionalities have been\nrefactored and successfully integrated into the new desktop application. This\nincludes the display of listings, the flagging and voting of listing items,\nadding items to the cart and the checkout process, the favoriting of items, and\nthe managing of shipping profiles. These have all been marked as complete.\n\nNew Updated Place Bid Modal (Complete)\nIn the Cart section of the desktop application, the Place Bid modal has been\nredesigned to provide more information to the user and fit with the updated look\nof Particl Desktop.\n\nBug Fixes and General Improvements (Constantly in progress)\nWallet Encryption Modal Preview (WIP)A significant number of bug fixes and improvements to functionalities across the\nGUI implementation of the marketplace has been made. This, of course, is an\nongoing process and is always something on which the Particl developers are\nworking on at every release.\n\nUser Interface and User Experience Improvements (Constantly in progress)\nNew Batch Listing Modal Preview (WIP)As development goes on, numerous changes are being made to the design and layout \nof the desktop application to ensure the user has the best possible flow and\ninteraction within the GUI. This is an ongoing process and is always being\nworked on at every release.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNew Changes to the Market Codebase\nSince the last Development Update, a lot of changes have been successfully\nimplemented into the new market codebase (the underlying “backend” code of the\nmarketplace).\n\nHere’s a detailed list of all the recent changes:\n\n * Changes in ListingItemTemplates with market specific ListingItemTemplate and\n   versioning support.\n * Added additional validations for all marketplace messages.\n * All search commands refactored, added more validations.\n * Changes in ListingItemAdd/Vote message signing.\n * ShoppingCart linked to Identity rather than Profile.\n * Identity Vote calculations fixed.\n * Added push notifications for new Proposals.\n * Market specific ItemCategory support.\n * Market specific Proposals.\n * Bug fixes related to ListingItem/Image message separation.\n * Added Default Market and Profile commands.\n * OMP Library changes/bug fixes.\n * Smaller and larger API changes in ~45 of ~115 RPC commands.\n * Fixed some issues running the market with node v12.\n * Fixed/changed/added around 900 automated and integration test cases.\n * A number of changes all around as a result of the test case results.\n * Marketplace 0.2.10 bugfix release.\n\n> Note: Automating the build/upload into a more regular process is planned to be\nlooked into again soon after the v3.0 release.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDirect Buyer/Seller Communications Coming to V3.0\nA new and highly anticipated functionality is making its way onto Particl\nDesktop 3.0 — buyer and seller communications.\n\nNew Buyer/Seller Communications Section Preview (WIP)Whether you are a seller or\na buyer, this major improvement to the Question and Answer feature will let you\ncommunicate with the party you’re transacting with in case there is a need for\nit. It uses the same system as the Question and Answer section and is integrated\ndirectly as part of the escrow process.\n\nCommunication is vital for any mistake or issue to be resolved. But it also\nopens up the door to fraud, blackmail, and scam. For this reason, all messages\nsent between the two parties are publicly recorded directly in the Question and\nAnswer section. The system is directly linked to the user market dashboard and\nnotifies you whenever you receive a question or answer.\n\n> Note: This communication module is different than the encrypted instant\nmessaging app being worked on by DeMarkets.io. Keep reading for more details on\nit.\nThis completely transparent solution is to keep both parties in check and ensure\nthat they do not use this communications module to blackmail or threaten the\nother party which would then weaken the game-theory behind Particl’s two-party\nescrow system. Of course, it doesn’t prevent two users from exchanging contact\ninformation (i.e. sharing their Particl chat keys with each other or using a\nthird-party messaging app like Telegram), but it provides a great level of\ntransparency that can be used for vendors to build a reputation for themselves.\nBut more importantly than anything, it simply provides the ability for two\ntransacting users to touch base and resolve issues.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdates From DeMarkets.io\nDeMarkets.ioOver the last few weeks, the DeMarkets.io [http://DeMarkets.io] developers have\nbeen quite active. If you don’t know about DeMarkets.io already, a web browser\nfor decentralized marketplaces with additional features to come and have been\ncontributing to the Particl project for the last several months. Their website\ncurrently displays Particl Marketplace statistics and provides a listing browser\nthat lets you see marketplace listings from the web, without having to download\nParticl Desktop.\n\nDeMarkets.io has recently been working on two items that will be major\ncontributors to the Particl ecosystem. Here’s an update on each of them.\n\nNew DeMarkets.io Website\nThe DeMarkets team has been working on a major update to its website that\nchanges most of it. This update is planned to be released shortly and adds the\nability to view and share individual listings. It also lets you create shops on\nthe website so that you can aggregate and easily showcase your listings as a\nvendor. DeMarkets estimates the update will go live within the next 1 to 2 weeks\n.\n\nEncrypted Instant Messaging App (Particl Desktop)\nTheir team has also been working on an encrypted instant messaging application\nthat will be integrated as a new Particl Desktop module. The app is powered by\nSMSG and lets users safely communicate without worrying about any third-party\nbeing able to intercept and read messages.\n\nThe encrypted instant messaging app is still under development and has taken a\nsecond priority, behind the release of DeMarkets.io’s new website. It is\ncurrently scheduled to go live shortly after Particl V3.0.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt’s All Coming Together Nicely\nAs you can see, the Particl developers have been putting the pedal to the metal\nfor the last few weeks so that they can complete the remaining items required\nfor launching Particl V3.0 as fast as possible.\n\nThe great majority of the core components required for it to be ready are now\ncomplete or are well on their way to being ready. This leaves fewer and fewer\nitems left to integrate into the new desktop application and brings us closer to\nthe release every day.\n\nKeep in mind, Particl V3.0 is Particl’s biggest update to date. It not only\nsignificantly changes the marketplace codebase but also the desktop application\nas a whole. For this reason, this particular update has taken much longer to be\nready than other past releases, but the difference in user experience will\nabsolutely speak for itself.\n\nParticl V3 is going to be much faster, lightweight, easier to use, and\nfeature-complete than it has ever been.","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Development-Update--10-08-2020-/1-sHXTBG2Awq9mmhexu0LdzA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"particl-v3-0-updates-and-more\">Particl V3.0 Updates and More</h3><p>In the past few weeks, the development of Particl V3.0 has been going particularly smoothly which has allowed the Particl developers to make a lot of progress on every front.</p><p>Here is the latest development progress report from Particl’s Development Manager Henk Swardt.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> All screenshots included in this update are work-in-progress and subject to change before the mainnet release.

If you don’t know about DeMarkets.io already, a web browser for decentralized marketplaces with additional features to come and have been contributing to the Particl project for the last several months. Their website currently displays Particl Marketplace statistics and provides a listing browser that lets you see marketplace listings from the web, without having to download Particl Desktop.</p><p>DeMarkets.io has recently been working on two items that will be major contributors to the Particl ecosystem. Here’s an update on each of them.</p><h3 id=\"new-demarkets-io-website\">New DeMarkets.io Website</h3><p>The DeMarkets team has been working on a major update to its website that changes most of it. This update is planned to be released shortly and <strong>adds the ability to view and share individual listings</strong>. It also lets you <strong>create shops on the website </strong>so that you can aggregate and easily showcase your listings as a vendor.

This leaves fewer and fewer items left to integrate into the new desktop application and brings us closer to the release every day.</p><p>Keep in mind, <strong>Particl V3.0 is Particl’s biggest update to date</strong>. It not only significantly changes the marketplace codebase but also the desktop application as a whole.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
