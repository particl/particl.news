During this time, the team and community\ntesters have been hard at work identifying & fixing the last of the small issues\nstill present in the latest testnet builds.\n\nWith a stable build nearing completion, it is imperative to prepare our main\nParticl Network blockchain for the addition of a privacy-focused decentralized\nmarketplace. The first step is a code update that will allow decentralized\ngovernance to work properly (with coin weight) and requires hardfork. Ahead of\nthis, and a non-event for most users, will be a hardfork of our Particl test\nnetwork as well.\n\nHere are the things you need to know.\n\nPlanned Hardfork Schedule\nTestnet Fork (Particl Core 0.18)\n⭐️ 2019.02.16 —12:00:00 UTC\n\n * VARIABLE SMSG FEE\n * MULTISIG COLDSTAKING\n * BULLETPROOFS\n\nMainnet Fork (Particl Core 0.17)\n⭐️ 2019.03.01 —12:00:00 UTC\n\n * PAID SMSG\n * MULTISIG COLDSTAKING\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTestnet Hardfork (16th of February)\n> 2019.02.16–12:00:00 UTC\nIn 4 days, on the 16th of February, we’re going to fork Particl’s test network\n(testnet) to merge a couple of features that have been sitting in RegTest\n(internal pre-testnet network) for some time now. This hardfork doesn’t require\nyou to do anything but, of course, it will allow you to test these new features\non our public testnet.\n\nBulletproofs\nThis testnet hardfork is going to include Bulletproofs, the Confidential\nTransactions protocol improvement that will reduce the size of CT/RingCT\ntransactions by ~70%. Bulletproofs is an important brick in Particl’s wall of\nprivacy as it will allow RingCT and CT transactions to be executed without\nbloating the blockchain and bringing its size to absurd levels. We believe\nprivacy and scalability can and should go hand in hand.\n\nWhy make compromises when you can have the best of both worlds?\n\nMulti-Signature Cold Staking\nAs some of you already know, we are already working on a major new feature to\nour mobile app, Particl Copay; Cold staking capabilities! This testnet hardfork\nwill add multi-signature cold staking support, meaning it will now be possible\nto cold stake funds held collectively by multiple devices.\n\nThis will give you access to the utmost level of privacy Proof-of-Stake can\noffer.\n\nIn fact, cold staking from multi-signature addresses means you will need to have\naccess to more than one device to move funds around. This constitutes a solid\nbarrier to anyone looking into stealing your coins as they would be required to\nget a hold of all of your signing devices.\n\n> Note: Ledger Nano devices won’t initially be compatible with multi-signature\ncold staking, however we’ve already identified that, and with the help of a\ncustom script, it could be possible to make the hardware devices compatible.\nThis may not come immediately, but is good to know for future endeavors!\nVariable SMSG Fee\nThis feature is probably not an exciting one at first sight but will be very\nimportant when it comes to implementing advanced escrow features. This protocol\nimprovement allows SMSG messages to have various fees, allowing, for example,\ncustom escrow security deposit ratios (agree with the other party to put any %\nof the item’s value as security deposit instead of 100% every time). You won’t\nreally be able to test variable SMSG in a practical way until this feature is\nintegrated into the escrow system. But, it’s nonetheless an important feature\nmaking its way onto testnet.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMainnet Hardfork\n> 2019.03.01–12:00:00 UTC\nIn order for the Open Marketplace to go live a couple things need to happen; the\ntrustless escrow system needs to be adapted to our OMP-library for blinded\nescrow (privacy), and Paid SMSG needs to be onboarded to mainnet. The latter\nrequires a planned hardfork which will happen on March 1st 2019, at 12:00 am GMT\n.\n\nHardforking is a pretty big deal, especially as it requires the greater majority\nof nodes to update in a timely manner. This requirement also applies to\nthird-parties and exchanges to ensure that they do not run an outdated fork of\nthe project. For this reason, we’ve already started contacting third-parties\nlast week to let them know the improvements coming to the Particl Network and be\nleaders in the shift to the new chain.\n\n> Note: for users of Particl Desktop and Particl Copay mobile apps, the clients\nwill automatically upgrade and sync with the correct chain seamlessly in the\nbackground. For most users both planned hardforks will be non-events but we\nwanted to responsibly let you know what is coming on March 1st.\nPaid SMSG Messages\nThis feature is necessary in order for the governance system to function\nproperly on mainnet. This is the missing piece that needs to be added onto\nmainnet (it already works flawlessly on testnet) so that governance votes (both\nproposals and listing flags) can be properly registered with coin weight.\n\nWe cannot release the marketplace on mainnet without this critical feature.\n\nMulti-Signature Cold Staking\nAs mentioned above, we’ll be hardforking multi-signature cold staking\ncapabilities onto testnet on the 16th of February. This will give 2 weeks for\ntesting properly this protocol enhancement after which we’ll merge onto mainnet\nat the same time as the paid SMSG message hardfork. This should reduce the risks\nassociated with executing hardforks by combining both these items into the same\nhardfork.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe’d also like to thank everybody that has helped us test the latest testnet\nversion of the marketplace. We are still working on preparing the groundwork for\nthe Open Marketplace’s mainnet launch, and wanted to relay parts of the critical\npath in an easy, step-by-step manner so everyone on the same page.\n\nIn the meantime, you can relax and watch our latest AMA/FAQ Session\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoB1_rNWvEM], Paul’s latest interview with\nCryptoTradingFR (part 1 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN1bEatbNrQ], part 2\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DI-lG14WktE&t=1s]), or just launch and play\nwith the latest testnet builds\n[https://particl.news/new-open-marketplace-testnet-builds-a45fbc699fc5] of\nParticl’s Open Marketplace!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Development-Update---Planned-Hardfork-Schedule/1-kh3WLAKAS__ioHCNfdYKxg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"preparing-mainnet-for-a-private-decentralized-marketplace\">Preparing Mainnet for a Private, Decentralized Marketplace</h3><p>Over the past few weeks we’ve started preparing the groundwork for Particl’s Open Marketplace first mainnet release.

During this time, the team and\ncommunity testers have been hard at work identifying & fixing the last of the\nsmall issues still present in the latest testnet builds.\n\nWith a stable build nearing completion, it is imperative that Particl’s main\nnetwork is prepared for the addition of a privacy-focused decentralized\nmarketplace. The first step is a code update that will allow decentralized\ngovernance to work properly (with coin weight). Ahead of this, and a non-event\nfor most users, will be a hardfork of our Particl test network as well.\n\nHere are the things you need to know.\n\nPlanned Hardfork Schedule\nTestnet Fork (Particl Core 0.18)\n⭐️ 2019.02.16–12:00:00\n\n * VARIABLE SMSG FEE\n * MULTISIG COLDSTAKING\n * BULLETPROOFS\n\nMainnet Fork (Particl Core 0.17)\n⭐️ 2019.03.01–12:00:00\n\n * PAID SMSG\n * MULTISIG COLDSTAKING\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTestnet Hardfork (16th of February)\n> 2019.02.16–12:00:00\nIn 4 days, on the 16th of February, Particl’s test network (testnet) is going to\nfork in order to merge a couple of features that have been sitting in RegTest\n(internal pre-testnet network) for some time now. If you are a Particl holder,\nthis hardfork doesn’t require you to do anything but, of course, it will allow\nyou to test these new features on our public testnet.\n\nBulletproofs\nThis testnet hardfork is going to include Bulletproofs, the Confidential\nTransactions protocol improvement that will reduce the size of CT/RingCT\ntransactions by ~70%. Bulletproofs is an important brick in Particl’s wall of\nprivacy as it will allow RingCT and CT transactions to be executed without\nbloating the blockchain and bringing its size to absurd levels. Privacy and\nscalability can and should go hand in hand.\n\nWhy make compromises when you can have the best of both worlds?\n\nMulti-Signature Cold Staking\nParticl has been working on a major new feature to its mobile app, Particl\nCopay; Cold staking capabilities! This testnet hardfork will add multi-signature\ncold staking support, meaning it will now be possible to cold stake funds held\ncollectively by multiple devices.\n\nThis will give users access to the utmost level of privacy Proof-of-Stake can\noffer.\n\nIn fact, cold staking from multi-signature addresses means users will need to\nhave access to more than one device to move funds around. This constitutes a\nsolid barrier to anyone looking into stealing coins as they would be required to\nget a hold of all of the signing devices.\n\n> Note: Ledger Nano devices won’t initially be compatible with multi-signature\ncold staking, however, Particl has already identified that, and with the help of\na custom script, it could be possible to make the hardware devices compatible.\nThis may not come immediately, but is good to know for future endeavors!\nVariable SMSG Fee\nThis feature is probably not an exciting one at first sight but will be very\nimportant when it comes to implementing advanced escrow features. This protocol\nimprovement allows SMSG messages to have various fees, allowing, for example,\ncustom escrow security deposit ratios (agree with the other party to put any %\nof the item’s value as security deposit instead of 100% every time). It won’t\nreally be possible to test variable SMSG in a practical way until this feature\nis integrated into the escrow system. But, it’s nonetheless an important feature\nmaking its way onto testnet.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMainnet Hardfork\n> 2019.03.01–12:00:00\nIn order for the Open Marketplace to go live a couple things need to happen; the\ntrustless escrow system needs to be adapted to our OMP-library for blinded\nescrow (privacy), and Paid SMSG needs to be onboarded to mainnet. The latter\nrequires a planned hardfork which will happen on March 1st 2019, at 12:00 am GMT\n.\n\nHardforking is a pretty big deal, especially as it requires the greater majority\nof nodes to update in a timely manner. This requirement also applies to\nthird-parties and exchanges to ensure that they do not run an outdated fork of\nthe project. For this reason, Particl has already started contacting\nthird-parties last week to let them know the improvements coming to the Particl\nNetwork and be leaders in the shift to the new chain.\n\n> Note: for users of Particl Desktop and Particl Copay mobile apps, the clients\nwill automatically upgrade and sync with the correct chain seamlessly in the\nbackground. For most users both planned hardforks will be non-events but we\nwanted to responsibly let you know what is coming on March 1st.\nPaid SMSG Messages\nThis feature is necessary in order for the governance system to function\nproperly on mainnet. This is the missing piece that needs to be added onto\nmainnet (it already works flawlessly on testnet) so that governance votes (both\nproposals and listing flags) can be properly registered with coin weight.\n\nThe marketplace cannot release on mainnet without this critical feature.\n\nMulti-Signature Cold Staking\nAs mentioned above, Particl will be hardforking multi-signature cold staking\ncapabilities onto testnet on the 16th of February. This will give 2 weeks for\ntesting properly this protocol enhancement after which it’ll merge onto mainnet\nat the same time as the paid SMSG message hardfork. This should reduce the risks\nassociated with executing hardforks by combining both these items into the same\nhardfork.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Particl team would also like to thank everybody that has helped them test\nthe latest testnet version of the marketplace. We are still working on preparing\nthe groundwork for the Open Marketplace’s mainnet launch, and wanted to relay\nparts of the critical path in an easy, step-by-step manner so everyone on the\nsame page.\n\nIn the meantime, you can relax and watch our latest AMA/FAQ Session\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoB1_rNWvEM], Paul’s latest interview with\nCryptoTradingFR (part 1 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN1bEatbNrQ], part 2\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DI-lG14WktE&t=1s]), or just launch and play\nwith the latest testnet builds\n[https://particl.news/new-open-marketplace-testnet-builds-a45fbc699fc5] of\nParticl’s Open Marketplace!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Upcoming-Hardforks/1-kh3WLAKAS__ioHCNfdYKxg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"preparing-mainnet-for-a-private-decentralized-marketplace\">Preparing Mainnet for a Private, Decentralized Marketplace</h3><p>Over the past few weeks, Particl has started preparing the groundwork for Particl’s Open Marketplace first mainnet release.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
