First conceptualized in 2013 by TierNolan on the\nBitcointalk forums\n[https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=193281.msg2003765#msg2003765], this\nfirst iteration of the concept, involving HTLCs (Hashed Time Lock Contracts),\nwould need four more years to finally see the light of day.\n\nAtomic swaps must involve two parties - as such, no third party or outside\nmiddleman can interrupt or interfere with the transaction. This characteristic\nmeans they are decentralized by nature and effectively immune to censorship, and\nas such are used in several decentralized exchanges, such as BasicSwap DEX and\nothers.\n\nIn the BasicSwap application, nearly all of the steps involved in both types of\nswaps happen seamlessly, at the back-end level. Furthermore, the initial\nagreement on the amounts and assets involved in any given swap between two\nparties is handled by its entirely distributed order book, powered by Particl's\nown encrypted mixnet, the SMSG network\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/].\n\nThe Original: Hashed Time Lock Contract (“Secret Hash”) Atomic Swaps\nThe first successful implementation of atomic swaps came from the Decred project\n[https://github.com/decred/atomicswap], leveraging \"hashlocks\" and \"timelocks\",\nwith the help of on-chain scripts (or smart contracts), to accomplish the atomic\nswap conceptualized by TierNolan years earlier. We refer to this type of swap as\na \"secret hash\" swap, or HTLC swap.\n\nTechnically speaking, the HTLC feature allows two users to conduct time-bound\ncryptocurrency transactions. This is highly relevant to this first\nimplementation of atomic swap technology, as the recipient must submit a\ncryptographic proof (the “secret”) to the contract within a set timeframe \n(established in number of blocks, or block height), or else the funds will be\nreturned to the sender. If the recipient acknowledges the payment, the\ntransaction is successful. This, as it happens, requires both participating\nblockchains to have both Hashlock and Timelock capabilities - a condition that\nleaves out certain blockchains, such as the notoriously rigid and hyper-private\nMonero blockchain.\n\nThese two key concepts may be summarized in the following way:\n\nA hashlock is a function of certain blockchains that restricts the spending of\nfunds until a certain piece of data is publicly disclosed (such as a\ncryptographic proof, in the form of a hash\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function]).\n\n\nA timelock is a function that restricts the spending of funds until a specific\ntime (or block height) in the future. This ensures that the transaction occurs\nwithin a given timeframe, and returns funds to the depositor if it is not\ncompleted, without a need for a third party adjudicator.\n\nThe graph below, sourced from Decred's implementation of atomic swaps, provides\na visual representation of the steps and necessary transfers of data that each\nparty performs:\n\n\n\nA HTLC (or \"secret hash\") atomic swap.\n\nIn other words, HTLC-based atomic swaps work as follows: \n\nAlice and Bob must first agree on the amounts and assets (e.g. Bitcoin and\nEther) to exchange. Alice then generates a random secret, s, and uses a\ncryptographic hash function to generate hash, h. She then creates an HTLC\ncontract using h, which locks up the Bitcoin. These coins can either be redeemed\n(spent) using the secret s, or they will be returned to her after a certain\namount of time, t, has passed. Bob does the same thing with his Ether on the\nother chain, locking it up in an HTLC using the same hash, h. Since Alice knows\nthe original secret, s, which was used to produce the hash, h, she can redeem\nthe Ether from Bob's HTLC. By doing so she reveals the secret s to Bob, who can\nthen take the Bitcoin and complete the swap.\n\nWithout diving too deep into the back-end inputs necessary to achieve a\nsuccessful HTLC swap as described in the graph above, the \"secret hash\" involved\nin them is the reason why HTLC swaps are sometimes referred to as \"Secret Hash\nswaps\". For the curious, more extensive documentation on the scripts involved in\nsecret hash swaps is available on the Decred atomic swap github page\n[https://github.com/decred/atomicswap].\n\nSome Shortcomings of Secret Hash Atomic Swaps\nAlthough they are a remarkable breakthrough in the space of decentralized \nexchange technologies, \"secret hash\" atomic swaps are not perfect: these atomic\nswap transactions, and thus, their associated data as well, take place on-chain,\nwhich has privacy implications that are particularly relevant to BasicSwap.\n\nWhenever a swap occurs, an identical hashed value will appear on both\nblockchains within a few blocks of each other — meaning that any moderately\nsophisticated passive observer of the two chains can easily link the coins\ninvolved in the swap, by finding identical hashes in blocks close to each other,\ntimestamp-wise. When the coins are tracked across chains, the provenance is\neasily established. Although there is no associated identity data revealed from\nsuch an analysis, it can potentially be trivial for third-parties to infer the\nidentity of the participants involved.\n\nThe Latest: Adaptor Signature (“Scriptless”) Atomic Swaps\nThe second type of atomic swap available on BasicSwap, dubbed \"adaptor sig\"\nswaps, is based on the work of Monero developer Joël \"h4sh3d\" Gugger, in a Sept.\n2020 paper titled \"Bitcoin–Monero Cross-chain Atomic Swap\"\n[https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126]. H4sh3d’s work can be said to be an\nimplementation of Lloyd Fournier’s work\n[https://github.com/LLFourn/one-time-VES/blob/master/main.pdf] on One-Time\nVerifiably Encrypted Signatures, A.K.A. Adaptor Signatures.\n\nThis type of swap is by necessity fundamentally different from HTLCs, because it\nis impossible for an XMR output to have an associated script. Therefore, a\ndifferent method, which relies in part on necessary prerequisites provided by\nthe non-XMR party, needs to be used to create the lock transaction. Note that\nthese prerequisites are such that the initiating party of the “adaptor sig” swap\nprotocol is only compatible with cryptocurrencies which use a bitcoin-style\ndecentralized UTXO model\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspent_transaction_output], and that have Segwit\nor a Segwit-equivalent malleability fix\n[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_malleability], such as Litecoin.\n\nThose \"scriptless\" swaps rely on a cryptographic technology known as an \"adaptor\nsignature\". In essence, without going too deep into the origins and underlying\nmath behind the technology, an adaptor signature is an additional signature that\nis combined with an initial signature to reveal a secret piece of data. Adaptor\nsignatures enable two parties to reveal two pieces of data to each other\nsimultaneously, and are the key building block of the kind of scriptless\nprotocols that render XMR atomic swap pairs possible.\n\nHow Does It Work?\nThis part of the article is particularly technical, but can shed some light on\nthe privacy distinctions between both swaps.\n\nThe graph below provides a visual representation of the steps and necessary\ntransfers of data that each party performs in an adaptor signature-based swap on\nBSX, from the offerer’s perspective. The green communication layer, in the case\nof BasicSwap, is handled by the SMSG network:\n\nAn \"adaptor sig\" atomic swap, from the Offerer's perspective.In other words,\nadaptor signature-based atomic swaps work as follows:\n\nAlice and Bob must first agree on the amounts and assets (e.g. BTC and XMR) to\nexchange. Just like in the case of “secret hash” swaps, this is achieved in a\nprivate and decentralized way in BasicSwap via its distributed order book.\n\nNote that a property of Monero is that the sum of public keys will match the\npublic key for the sum of private keys. By sending XMR to the sum of the public\nkeys they chose, Alice and Bob can create a lock tx similar to those used in the\nHLTC protocol.\n\nThe basic idea is:\n\nAlice and Bob each pick two secret (ECC) private keys (BTC and XMR), and swap\none set of public keys with each other. Here, three different keys are involved\nfor each side.\n\nAlice sends a BTC transaction with an output to a multisig output, which\nrequires a signature from both Alice and Bob in order to spend it. Once that\noccurs, Bob sees the BTC tx and sends the XMR tx to the XMR public key sum, as\nmentioned above.\n\nAlice signs for her private key and encumbers that signature with Bob's\nxmr_public_key.\n\nShe sends that adaptor signature to Bob. This adaptor signature is not a\ntransaction signature, so the transaction cannot be spent yet, but it does\ncommit to a secret value (Alice’s private key).\n\nBob then decodes the adaptor signature with his xmr_private key and then signs\nfor the BTC lock tx with his btc_private key.\n\nAs Bob now has a valid signature from Alice and himself, he can now spend from\nthe locked BTC tx.\n\nAlice watches the BTC chain for the tx that spends the lock tx. With Bob's\nsignature, which is broadcast publicly on the Bitcoin side once the Bitcoin\nlocked transaction is redeemed, she can recover Bob's xmr_private key.\n\nAlice, now endowed with both her and Bob's xmr_private keys, can spend from the\nXMR lock transaction, concluding the exchange.\n\n“****in’ VOILA” - Dr. Danny Duberstein accomplishing a BTC->XMR adaptor sig\natomic swap for the first time (allegedly)Some Advantages of Adaptor Signature\nSwaps\nAtomic swaps using adaptor signatures have several advantages over traditional\natomic swaps involving HTLCs.\n\nThe first thing to understand is that the adaptor signature swap scheme replaces\nthe on-chain scripts, involving timelocks and hashlocks, on which “secret hash”\nswaps rely on. In other words, the secret and secret-hash in a HTLC swap (as\ndetailed in the first graph) have no immediate parallel in adaptor sig swaps.\nThis particularity of adaptor signature technology is why their implementations\nare sometimes referred to as “scriptless scripts” within the Bitcoin research\ncommunity.\n\nSince no such script is involved, the on-chain footprint is reduced, which has\nthe non-negligible advantage of making the atomic swap more lightweight, and\ntherefore cheaper.\n\nFurthermore, contrary to HTLCs where the same hash has to be used on each chain,\ntransactions involved in an atomic swap using adaptor signatures cannot be\nlinked. This, again, is particularly relevant to BasicSwap’s privacy\nconsiderations [https://particl.news/privacy-and-liquidity-in-basicswap/],\ngranted that at least one of the two coins involved in the cross-chain swaps\nfulfills the prerequisites mentioned in the second paragraph of this article.\n\nThe Path Ahead for BSX: Two-Way Adaptor Signature Setup\nBecause scripts are not possible on blockchains like XMR, there are currently\nconstraints on which coin can initiate a swap on BSX. To trade Monero for\nBitcoin, for example, only the BTC-owning side can *initiate* a transaction. \n\nYet, because advance planning can be done consistent with atomic swapping, it is\nconceptually possible for both sides to effectively originate a swap:\n\nIf I have XMR and want, say, BTC, one could simply post a desire to do a trade \nas their offer. The BTC owner could then initiate the current, more formal\nprocess, still risk free. This process can be automated and be all but invisible\nto the front-end user experience, and is a major and very exciting upcoming item\non the BSX roadmap [https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap].\n\nTo Conclude…\nThe objective of this article is to provide a moderate but somewhat accessible\nunderstanding of why adaptor signature swaps can said to be a more private\nalternative to HTLC swaps, and how it protects swappers from any sort of\nmalicious passive observance by achieving the necessary smart contract logic for\nan atomic swap, without the use of on-chain script or hashed secrets. \n\nAs always, if you care about privacy as we do, we invite you to spread the word\nabout BasicSwap\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-dex/basicswap_explained.html]’s\nongoing open beta.

In other words, the secret and secret-hash in a HTLC swap (as detailed in the first graph) <strong>have no immediate parallel</strong> in adaptor sig swaps. This particularity of adaptor signature technology is why their implementations are sometimes referred to as “<strong>scriptless scripts</strong>” within the Bitcoin research community.</p><p>Since no such script is involved, the <strong>on-chain footprint is reduced,</strong> which has the non-negligible advantage of making the atomic swap more lightweight, and therefore cheaper.</p><p>Furthermore, contrary to HTLCs where the same hash has to be used on each chain, transactions involved in an atomic swap using adaptor signatures <strong>cannot be linked</strong>. This, again, is particularly relevant to <a href=\"https://particl.news/privacy-and-liquidity-in-basicswap/\">BasicSwap’s privacy considerations</a>, granted that<strong> at least one of the two coins involved in the cross-chain swaps fulfills the prerequisites mentioned in the second paragraph of this article</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"the-path-ahead-for-bsx-two-way-adaptor-signature-setup\">The Path Ahead for BSX: Two-Way Adaptor Signature Setup</h3><p>Because scripts are not possible on blockchains like XMR, there are currently constraints on which coin can initiate a swap on BSX.

First conceptualized in 2013 by <a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=193281.msg2003765#msg2003765\">TierNolan on the Bitcointalk forums</a>, this first iteration of the concept, involving HTLCs (Hashed Time Lock Contracts), would need four more years to finally see the light of day.</p><p>Atomic swaps must involve two parties - as such, no third party or outside middleman can interrupt or interfere with the transaction. This characteristic means they are decentralized by nature and effectively immune to censorship, and as such are used in several decentralized exchanges, such as BasicSwap DEX and others.</p><p>In the BasicSwap application, nearly all of the steps involved in both types of swaps happen seamlessly, at the back-end level. Furthermore, the initial agreement on the amounts and assets involved in any given swap between two parties is handled by its entirely distributed order book, powered by Particl's own encrypted mixnet, the <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\">SMSG network</a>.</p><h2 id=\"the-original-hashed-time-lock-contract-secret-hash-atomic-swaps\">The Original: Hashed Time Lock Contract (“Secret Hash”) Atomic Swaps</h2><p>The first successful implementation of atomic swaps came <a href=\"https://github.com/decred/atomicswap\">from the Decred project</a>, leveraging \"hashlocks\" and \"timelocks\", with the help of on-chain scripts (or smart contracts), to accomplish the atomic swap conceptualized by TierNolan years earlier. We refer to this type of swap as a \"secret hash\" swap, or HTLC swap.</p><p>Technically speaking, the HTLC feature allows two users to conduct time-bound cryptocurrency transactions. This is highly relevant to this first implementation of atomic swap technology, as the recipient must submit a cryptographic proof (the “secret”) to the contract <strong>within a set timeframe</strong> (established in number of blocks, or block height), or else the funds will be returned to the sender. If the recipient acknowledges the payment, the transaction is successful. This, as it happens, requires both participating blockchains to have both <strong>Hashlock </strong>and <strong>Timelock </strong>capabilities - a condition that leaves out certain blockchains, such as the notoriously rigid and hyper-private Monero blockchain.</p><p>These two key concepts may be summarized in the following way:</p><p>A <strong>hashlock </strong>is a function of certain blockchains that restricts the spending of funds until a certain piece of data is publicly disclosed (such as a cryptographic proof, in the form of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function\">hash</a>).<br></p><p>A <strong>timelock </strong>is a function that restricts the spending of funds until a specific time (or block height) in the future. This ensures that the transaction occurs within a given timeframe, and returns funds to the depositor if it is not completed, without a need for a third party adjudicator.</p><p>The graph below, sourced from Decred's implementation of atomic swaps, provides a visual representation of the steps and necessary transfers of data that each party performs:</p><p></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2023/02/b8cfa1a1-d7ea-4f45-b79f-0609cff5889a.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2023/02/b8cfa1a1-d7ea-4f45-b79f-0609cff5889a.png 600w, /glink/2023/02/b8cfa1a1-d7ea-4f45-b79f-0609cff5889a.png 739w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>A HTLC (or \"secret hash\") atomic swap.</figcaption></figure><p></p><p>In other words, HTLC-based atomic swaps work as follows: </p><p>Alice and Bob must first agree on the amounts and assets (e.g. Bitcoin and Ether) to exchange. Alice then generates a random secret, s, and uses a cryptographic hash function to generate hash, <em>h</em>. She then creates an HTLC contract using <em>h</em>, which locks up the Bitcoin. These coins can either be redeemed (spent) using the secret <em>s</em>, or they will be returned to her after a certain amount of time, <em>t</em>, has passed. Bob does the same thing with his Ether on the other chain, locking it up in an HTLC using the same hash, <em>h</em>. Since Alice knows the original secret, <em>s</em>, which was used to produce the hash, <em>h</em>, she can redeem the Ether from Bob's HTLC. By doing so she reveals the secret <em>s</em> to Bob, who can then take the Bitcoin and complete the swap.</p><p>Without diving too deep into the back-end inputs necessary to achieve a successful HTLC swap as described in the graph above,<strong> the \"secret hash\" involved in them is the reason why HTLC swaps are sometimes referred to as \"Secret Hash swaps\"</strong>. For the curious, more extensive documentation on the scripts involved in secret hash swaps is available on the <a href=\"https://github.com/decred/atomicswap\">Decred atomic swap github page</a>.</p><h3 id=\"some-shortcomings-of-secret-hash-atomic-swaps\">Some Shortcomings of Secret Hash Atomic Swaps</h3><p>Although they are a remarkable breakthrough in the space of <strong>decentralized</strong> exchange technologies, \"secret hash\" atomic swaps are not perfect: these atomic swap transactions, and thus, their associated data as well, take place <strong>on-chain</strong>, which has privacy implications that are particularly relevant to BasicSwap.</p><p>Whenever a swap occurs, an identical hashed value will appear on both blockchains within a few blocks of each other — meaning that any moderately sophisticated passive observer of the two chains can easily link the coins involved in the swap, by finding identical hashes in blocks close to each other, timestamp-wise. When the coins are tracked across chains, the provenance is easily established. Although there is no associated identity data revealed from such an analysis, <strong>it can potentially be trivial for third-parties to infer the identity of the participants involved</strong>.</p><h2 id=\"the-latest-adaptor-signature-scriptless-atomic-swaps\">The Latest: Adaptor Signature (“Scriptless”) Atomic Swaps</h2><p>The second type of atomic swap available on BasicSwap, dubbed \"adaptor sig\" swaps, is based on the work of Monero developer Joël \"h4sh3d\" Gugger, in a Sept. 2020 paper titled <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126\">\"Bitcoin–Monero Cross-chain Atomic Swap\"</a>. H4sh3d’s work can be said to be an implementation of <a href=\"https://github.com/LLFourn/one-time-VES/blob/master/main.pdf\">Lloyd Fournier’s work</a> on One-Time Verifiably Encrypted Signatures, A.K.A. <strong>Adaptor Signatures</strong>.</p><p>This type of swap is by necessity fundamentally different from HTLCs, because it is impossible for an XMR output to have an associated script. Therefore, a different method, which relies in part on necessary prerequisites provided by the non-XMR party, needs to be used to create the lock transaction. Note that these prerequisites are such that the initiating party of the “adaptor sig” swap protocol is only compatible with cryptocurrencies which use a bitcoin-style decentralized <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspent_transaction_output\">UTXO model</a>, and that have Segwit or a Segwit-equivalent <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_malleability\">malleability fix</a>, such as Litecoin.</p><p>Those \"scriptless\" swaps rely on a cryptographic technology known as an \"adaptor signature\". In essence, without going too deep into the origins and underlying math behind the technology, an adaptor signature is an <strong>additional </strong>signature that is combined with an initial signature to reveal a secret piece of data. Adaptor signatures enable two parties to reveal <strong>two pieces of data</strong> to each other simultaneously, and are the key building block of the kind of scriptless protocols that render XMR atomic swap pairs possible.</p><h3 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How Does It Work?</h3><p>This part of the article is particularly technical, but can shed some light on the privacy distinctions between both swaps.</p><p>The graph below provides a visual representation of the steps and necessary transfers of data that each party performs in an adaptor signature-based swap on BSX, from the offerer’s perspective. The green communication layer, in the case of BasicSwap, is handled by the SMSG network:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-container\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-row\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"/glink/2023/02/dabb556d-c1d9-452b-b077-9e7b8de69c04.png\" width=\"935\" height=\"1405\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2023/02/dabb556d-c1d9-452b-b077-9e7b8de69c04.png 600w, /glink/2023/02/dabb556d-c1d9-452b-b077-9e7b8de69c04.png 935w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></div></div></div><figcaption>An \"adaptor sig\" atomic swap, from the Offerer's perspective.</figcaption></figure><p>In other words, adaptor signature-based atomic swaps work as follows:</p><p>Alice and Bob must first agree on the amounts and assets (e.g. BTC and XMR) to exchange.

Notably, this new\ncycle will bring forth groundbreaking advancements to the Particl Marketplace,\nmaking it more attainable and user-friendly than ever before.\n\nParticl’s Next Evolutionary Leap ForwardLearn about the team’s new major\ndevelopment cycle and discover Particl’s upcoming open-source foundation for\nthe\ndevelopment and deployment of privacy-first dApps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/]This blog post\nwill provide an overview of the Marketplace's short-to-medium-term roadmap, as\nwell as a clear breakdown of the early development plans that will shape Particl\ninto an open, connected, and modular ecosystem.\n\nAfter reading, you will have a clear understanding of the progress and\nmilestones that Particl will reach in 2023 and beyond — be sure to give it your\nfull attention!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTables of Contents\n * A New Journey Begins\n * New DeCommerce Apps Coming Up\n * Seller App Explained\n * Buyer App Explained\n * Liquidity Solutions\n * The Evolution of DeCommerce\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA New Journey Begins\nParticl Desktop 3.3 has recently been released on mainnet, and with it\nofficially begins the new development cycle that will transform Particl into a\nmodular, open, and highly efficient ecosystem for privacy-first and pro-liberty\ndApps.\n\nWhile Particl Desktop 3.3 made early strides towards that vision by decoupling\nParticl Core from the desktop client, the vision for Particl’s improved\narchitecture goes way beyond the confines of Particl Desktop.\n\nIndeed, one of the most prominent benefits of this new phase will be the\nintroduction of massive improvements to the functionality and accessibility of\nthe Particl Marketplace, a dApp that we believe is essential to our mission to\ncreate a parallel, independent economy.\n\nMajor Marketplace dApp Improvements Underway\nIn its current form, the Particl Marketplace is more a set of Particl Desktop\nfeatures than a standalone entity. This poses certain limitations that can only\nbe rectified by turning it into a proper standalone, flexible, and\nhyper-connected client.\n\nSince the Marketplace’s debut and over the course of its various iterations,\nwe've gathered feedback from our user base, including buyers and sellers who\nhave utilized the dApp extensively. By doing so, we have been able to compile a\nconcise list of essential enhancements that must be implemented in order to\nensure the marketplace achieves widespread adoption.\n\nConsequently, the improvements we are introducing to the marketplace dApp, and\nto the ecosystem as a whole, seek to increase its adoption potential by actively\naddressing its primary shortcomings.\n\nThe following items represent the aspects of the Particl Marketplace dApp we\nwant to improve in the months to come.\n\nSimplicity and User Experience\nAs it stands, Particl Marketplace is not optimized to support widespread\nadoption: its complex and time-consuming setup process, its reliance on a\ndesktop application, and its intricate user flow all render it unsuitable to the\naverage user. This is particularly true for less tech-savvy users, or users\ncoming from outside of cryptocurrency-focused communities.\n\nFurthermore, it can be said that the desktop interface, which was created for\nboth sellers and customers, increases the complexity of the platform compared to\nconventional e-commerce sites, which typically provide specific portals for the\ntwo types of users.\n\nAccessibility\nThe currently limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace is also an\nimportant hindrance to adoption and growth; as of now, in order to use the\nmarketplace, users must first download, install, and sync the Particl Desktop\napplication.\n\nRight from the onset, it is a tough sell to persuade online sellers and buyers\nto download a program for their eCommerce needs when there are numerous\nweb-based marketplaces available. What’s more, the need to first create a\nwallet, wait for a complete blockchain and then a secondary P2P network to sync\nin full is an additional, cumulative deterrent to even give the Marketplace a\ntry in the first place.\n\nIt’s not difficult to see how the absence of a web gateway and third-party\nintegration within the Particl Marketplace has hindered its adoption progress,\nespecially as we see the wider blockchain industry moving towards a more\nweb-based approach (i.e., Defi). Addressing that shortcoming is a key element of\nthe current Particl Marketplace development roadmap.\n\nLiquidity and Agnosticism\nA further impediment to the wider adoption of the Particl Marketplace is the\nlimited liquidity of the PART coin, as well as the lack of support for other\ndigital currencies.\n\nOn one hand, by introducing the ability to accept multiple currencies on the\nmarketplace (while still maintaining PART as the privacy-preserving settlement\nlayer), the dApp could rapidly expand its user base and broaden its use cases.\n\nHowever, as PART is vital to this process, there must be sufficient liquidity\nfor other currencies to exchange in and out of PART, and do so rapidly, without\ncausing significant slippage.\n\nFurthermore, sellers who wish to carry out transactions exclusively with PART\nmust still find a way to convert a portion of their sales revenue to cover\noperational costs, inventory, and other associated expenses. This is currently a\nchallenge due to the limited liquidity, which also leads to slippage and\nfinancial unpredictability.\n\nThe integration of BasicSwap-powered services into the marketplace and the\nforthcoming seller app holds considerable importance for both liquidity and the\ninclusion of new coins into the Particl economy. Other solutions are also\nactively being considered to further bolster liquidity for merchants.\n\nScalability\nFinally, although not an immediate concern, it is our intention to improve the\nmarketplace’s scalability. This is due to the fact that the SMSG network, which\nserves as the foundation of a significant portion of the Marketplace dApp, is\nalso a main component of the BasicSwap DEX.\n\nConsequently, should either of these two dApp's achieve considerable usage and\ngenerate large amounts of activity on the SMSG network, it could negatively\naffect the performance of other SMSG-dependent dApps.\n\nIn light of this, we have decided to begin work on a new version of SMSG,\ntentatively named SMSG 2.0. This new version will facilitate message\ndistribution, allowing for a much more scalable ecosystem where high usage of\nindividual dApps will not affect the performance of other dApps also utilizing\nthe SMSG 2.0 network.\n\nNew DeCommerce Apps Coming Up\nIt can be said that the liquidity, agnosticism, and scalability of the ecosystem\nare reliant in parts on some of its other components (i.e., BasicSwap and SMSG\n2.0); however, the user experience, simplicity, and accessibility can be\ndirectly enhanced by optimizing the marketplace dApp itself, as well as its\ngateways.\n\nAs such, our strategy for the near and intermediate future regarding the Particl\nMarketplace is to introduce two separate applications: a seller app (seller\ndashboard) and a buyer-oriented web/mobile gateway.\n\nLet’s explore each of these applications in more detail, and examine how they\nwill work synergistically to significantly improve the Particl Marketplace.\n\nSeller Dashboard (Standalone App)\nThe first application scheduled for release is a standalone seller dashboard to\nassist vendors on Particl Marketplace to manage their listings and activities.\nThe dashboard is composed of three distinct sections:\n\nRemote Services Management: This suite of capabilities provides the means to\nmanage connections to external services, such as WooCommerce and other eCommerce\nplatforms (Shopify, Medusa, etc), inventory management systems, liquidity\nproviders, and more.\n\nThe Particl Seller App is designed to integrate external services, granting\nsellers access to an ever-expanding range of eCommerce technologies, platforms,\nand plugins, and allowing them to leverage their various benefits directly on\nParticl Marketplace.\n\nInventory and Listing Management: This category deals with anything inventory\nand listing related. This includes management of listing data, prices, and\npublishing methodology, among other functions.\n\nNotably, the app will enable sellers to automatically republish listings on\nParticl Marketplace after expiration and to adjust PART prices in accordance\nwith current coin value via the optional utilization of APIs. This will\nsignificantly improve the seller experience and minimize the time needed to\nmanage and maintain Particl listings, which has been a widely requested\nimprovement from Particl Marketplace sellers.\n\nMarketplace Activities: This category encompasses all activities related to the\nmarketplace, including order management, customer communication, escrow\nprogression, and more.\n\nIn the end, sellers will be able to carry out all their tasks and activities\nexclusively from the seller app, without the need for Particl Desktop.\n\nTypical Flow\nIn order to understand the full potential of what this application enables, let\nus examine a hypothetical example of how it might be used by a fictitious\nseller.\n\nAlice, a dropshipper, has an eCommerce store powered by WooCommerce and is\nlooking to expand her reach by utilizing the Particl Marketplace. She downloads\nthe seller application and, with the help of the remote service manager, is able\nto seamlessly connect her WooCommerce store and import her full inventory with\nthe press of a button. Additionally, due to a specific WooCommerce plugin she\nuses which dynamically updates her item prices based on supplier data, she opts\nto have her inventory on the seller app stay in sync with any changes made on\nWooCommerce.\n\nHaving imported her inventory, she now configures her Particl Marketplace\naccount preferences. She opts to peg her listing prices to a fixed US dollar\nvaluation, pushing the price update once daily and ensuring that her items stay\nlisted on the marketplace consistently. As a renowned seller in her community\nwith recurring buyers, she also decides to set her escrow rate at 0%. And then,\nto lock in the value of her sales, she opts to automatically swap PART to USDT\nwhen a sale is finalized; she proceeds to the remote services manager and\nenables a liquidity plugin for that purpose. Finally, she enables a function to\nautomatically accept bids from certain countries to expedite the service she\nprovides to her customers.\n\nThen, as she receives orders, she can manage them all via the app, including\ndispatching tracking numbers, messages, and more, all without having to undergo\nParticl Desktop's extensive setup process.\n\nSubsequent Improvements\nThe example described above illustrates a few of the advantages sellers will\ngain in terms of user experience, convenience, and added capabilities via\nexternal integrations. But this proposed seller app is merely the first phase of\nwhat is ultimately envisioned.\n\nIn later stages, we intend to integrate its range of features into a\ncomprehensive web dashboard, enabling sellers to benefit from its features\nwithout requiring a software download.\n\nWe also plan on building a ready-made WooCommerce plugin that provides sellers\nwith the same features of the app, but fed directly into their WooCommerce\ndashboard. This includes the ability to receive, accept, and manage Particl\nMarketplace orders inside WooCommerce’s regular dashboard, in addition to\nsending and receiving messages and other supplementary features. When complete,\nthis will offer sellers the ability to list their inventory on Particl\nMarketplace with minimal disruption to their regular workflow, a considerable\nstep towards simplifying the acquisition of new sellers.\n\nThis is earmarked as a subsequent stage of the seller app, and requires further\nexploration. Nevertheless, this should give you a good understanding of the\npotential that Particl's open, modular, and highly-interconnected architecture\nprovides.\n\nUltimately, our goal is to incorporate a lot of these features into the desktop\nversion of Particl Marketplace — which will remain the best solution for those\nlooking for the maximum amount of decentralization and privacy — but first\ndeploying them within a standalone application is a quicker path towards\nproviding sellers with those much-needed improvements.\n\nMarketplace dApp Designed for Buyers\nEven with the wide range of features and enhancements to the seller experience,\nwe must not forget that Particl Marketplace is a two-way street. Without buyers,\nsellers cannot exist, and our plans for improvement would be incomplete without\nconsidering both sides of the equation.\n\nThat is why, subsequent to releasing the initial iterations of the seller app,\nthe next step will be to develop a mobile and/or web edition of the marketplace,\nfeaturing an entirely redesigned user experience tailored to buyers.\n\nThis will give online purchasers a more straightforward user experience, ridding\nthem of all superfluous vendor-related and technical features they don't need or\ncare about, and making Particl Marketplace more akin to what one would generally\nexpect from an online marketplace, while still benefiting from the advantages\nassociated with its decentralized and privacy-first nature.\n\nAlthough the exact features and functions of this app are yet to be determined,\nwe can confidently say that our goal is to provide a buyer experience that is as\nstreamlined and accessible as possible. To that end, we plan to focus on\nuser-friendliness and the intuitiveness of its user interface, wider\naccessibility through either web browsers or a mobile application (or both), and\nproviding a tailored experience that meets the specific needs of buyers.\n\nUpon completion of both the buyer and seller applications, Particl's DeCommerce\necosystem will be able to provide privacy, decentralization, and freedom, while\nminimizing the usual drawbacks associated with those terms. In essence, by\nsimplifying the use of Particl's DeCommerce products, the adoption potential of\nParticl Marketplace will inevitably be increased, bringing its benefits to as\nmany people as ever.\n\nLiquidity Solutions\nHaving great products is one thing — however, when it comes to Particl and\nDeCommerce, the liquidity of the underlying assets (in this case, PART pairs) is\nof equal importance.\n\nThis is why we are adding a remote services connector to the seller app, to work\nin tandem with BasicSwap DEX. With a modular and open approach to Particl, we\ncan integrate different liquidity services, such as instant-fill orders on BSX,\nas well as third-party liquidity services for the marketplace, to facilitate the\npurchasing and selling of PART for DeCommerce purposes.\n\nThe incorporation of these systems offers market makers the chance to benefit\nfrom the emergence of DeCommerce and generate income from Particl Marketplace\nsales, by providing the essential liquidity users will inevitably need to tap\ninto.\n\nAs we progress with the development of the aforementioned applications, we are\nalso researching various liquidity plugin concepts. We believe those will\nsignificantly enhance the user experience of the marketplace and enable Particl\nto be a successful, autonomous economy that keeps its no-compromise approach to\nprivacy and freedom.\n\nThe Evolution of DeCommerce\nWe hope that, by now, you have acquired an understanding of our\nshort-to-medium-term plans for the Particl Marketplace and the substantial\nadvantages of adapting Particl into a more open, connected, and modular system.\n\nAs we strive to enhance Particl Marketplace, please bear in mind that this is\nonly one element of our broader vision for Particl to become a privacy-first and\npro-liberty economy. We seek to build usable, accessible, and easy to use\napplications that bring the benefits of privacy and uncompromising\ndecentralization to as many people as possible, and we make important progress\ntowards that goal every day.\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nRemaining mindful of our open-source origins, we strongly urge you to stay\nup-to-date with the progress being made concerning the platform's modularity.\nThis will enable you to take advantage of a wealth of possibilities to create\nplugins, services, apps, and integrations that can optimize and expand the\noverall Particl ecosystem.\n\nAlso, if you’re not a developer and just have a great idea, you can also make a\nproposal to the community [https://ccs.particl.io/]! Who knows, maybe a great\nconcept that ends up revolutionizing the deCommerce game is really just one\nproposal away :^)\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

With a modular and open approach to Particl, we can integrate different liquidity services, such as instant-fill orders on BSX, as well as third-party liquidity services for the marketplace, to facilitate the purchasing and selling of PART for DeCommerce purposes.</p><p>The incorporation of these systems offers market makers the chance to benefit from the emergence of DeCommerce and generate income from Particl Marketplace sales, by providing the essential liquidity users will inevitably need to tap into.</p><p>As we progress with the development of the aforementioned applications, we are also researching various liquidity plugin concepts. We believe those will significantly enhance the user experience of the marketplace and enable Particl to be a successful, autonomous economy that keeps its no-compromise approach to privacy and freedom.</p><h1 id=\"the-evolution-of-decommerce\">The Evolution of DeCommerce</h1><p>We hope that, by now, you have acquired an understanding of our short-to-medium-term plans for the Particl Marketplace and the substantial advantages of adapting Particl into a more open, connected, and modular system.</p><p>As we strive to enhance Particl Marketplace, please bear in mind that this is only one element of our broader vision for Particl to become a privacy-first and pro-liberty economy.

This poses certain limitations that can only be rectified by turning it into a proper standalone, flexible, and hyper-connected client.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"/glink/2023/02/mp.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2023/02/mp.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2023/02/mp.png 1000w, /glink/2023/02/mp.png 1397w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"></figure><p>Since the Marketplace’s debut and over the course of its various iterations, we've gathered feedback from our user base, including buyers and sellers who have utilized the dApp extensively. By doing so, we have been able to compile a concise list of essential enhancements that must be implemented in order to ensure the marketplace achieves widespread adoption.</p><p>Consequently, the improvements we are introducing to the marketplace dApp, and to the ecosystem as a whole, seek to increase its adoption potential by actively addressing its primary shortcomings.</p><p>The following items represent the aspects of the Particl Marketplace dApp we want to improve in the months to come.</p><h3 id=\"simplicity-and-user-experience\">Simplicity and User Experience</h3><p>As it stands, Particl Marketplace is not optimized to support widespread adoption: its complex and time-consuming setup process, its reliance on a desktop application, and its intricate user flow all render it unsuitable to the average user. This is particularly true for less tech-savvy users, or users coming from outside of cryptocurrency-focused communities.</p><p>Furthermore, it can be said that the desktop interface, which was created for both sellers and customers, increases the complexity of the platform compared to conventional e-commerce sites, which typically provide specific portals for the two types of users.</p><h3 id=\"accessibility\">Accessibility</h3><p>The currently limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace is also an important hindrance to adoption and growth; as of now, in order to use the marketplace, users must first download, install, and sync the Particl Desktop application.</p><p>Right from the onset, it is a tough sell to persuade online sellers and buyers to download a program for their eCommerce needs when there are numerous web-based marketplaces available. What’s more, the need to first create a wallet, wait for a complete blockchain and then a secondary P2P network to sync in full is an additional, cumulative deterrent to even give the Marketplace a try in the first place.</p><p>It’s not difficult to see how the absence of a web gateway and third-party integration within the Particl Marketplace has hindered its adoption progress, especially as we see the wider blockchain industry moving towards a more web-based approach (i.e., Defi). Addressing that shortcoming is a key element of the current Particl Marketplace development roadmap.</p><h3 id=\"liquidity-and-agnosticism\">Liquidity and Agnosticism</h3><p>A further impediment to the wider adoption of the Particl Marketplace is the limited liquidity of the PART coin, as well as the lack of support for other digital currencies.</p><p>On one hand, by introducing the ability to accept multiple currencies on the marketplace (while still maintaining PART as the privacy-preserving settlement layer), the dApp could rapidly expand its user base and broaden its use cases.</p><p>However, as PART is vital to this process, there must be sufficient liquidity for other currencies to exchange in and out of PART, and do so rapidly, without causing significant slippage.</p><p>Furthermore, sellers who wish to carry out transactions exclusively with PART must still find a way to convert a portion of their sales revenue to cover operational costs, inventory, and other associated expenses. This is currently a challenge due to the limited liquidity, which also leads to slippage and financial unpredictability.</p><p>The integration of BasicSwap-powered services into the marketplace and the forthcoming seller app holds considerable importance for both liquidity and the inclusion of new coins into the Particl economy. Other solutions are also actively being considered to further bolster liquidity for merchants.</p><h3 id=\"scalability\">Scalability</h3><p>Finally, although not an immediate concern, it is our intention to improve the marketplace’s scalability. This is due to the fact that the SMSG network, which serves as the foundation of a significant portion of the Marketplace dApp, is also a main component of the BasicSwap DEX.</p><p>Consequently, should either of these two dApp's achieve considerable usage and generate large amounts of activity on the SMSG network, it could negatively affect the performance of other SMSG-dependent dApps.</p><p>In light of this, we have decided to begin work on a new version of SMSG, tentatively named SMSG 2.0. This new version will facilitate message distribution, allowing for a much more scalable ecosystem where high usage of individual dApps will not affect the performance of other dApps also utilizing the SMSG 2.0 network.</p><h1 id=\"new-decommerce-apps-coming-up\">New DeCommerce Apps Coming Up</h1><p>It can be said that the liquidity, agnosticism, and scalability of the ecosystem are reliant in parts on some of its other components (i.e., BasicSwap and SMSG 2.0); however, the user experience, simplicity, and accessibility can be directly enhanced by optimizing the marketplace dApp itself, as well as its gateways.</p><p>As such, our strategy for the near and intermediate future regarding the Particl Marketplace is to introduce two separate applications: a seller app (seller dashboard) and a buyer-oriented web/mobile gateway.</p><p>Let’s explore each of these applications in more detail, and examine how they will work synergistically to significantly improve the Particl Marketplace.</p><h2 id=\"seller-dashboard-standalone-app-\">Seller Dashboard (Standalone App)</h2><p>The first application scheduled for release is a standalone seller dashboard to assist vendors on Particl Marketplace to manage their listings and activities. The dashboard is composed of three distinct sections:</p><p><strong>Remote Services Management:</strong> This suite of capabilities provides the means to manage connections to external services, such as WooCommerce and other eCommerce platforms (Shopify, Medusa, etc), inventory management systems, liquidity providers, and more.</p><p>The Particl Seller App is designed to integrate external services, granting sellers access to an ever-expanding range of eCommerce technologies, platforms, and plugins, and allowing them to leverage their various benefits directly on Particl Marketplace.</p><p><strong>Inventory and Listing Management:</strong> This category deals with anything inventory and listing related. This includes management of listing data, prices, and publishing methodology, among other functions.</p><p>Notably, the app will enable sellers to automatically republish listings on Particl Marketplace after expiration and to adjust PART prices in accordance with current coin value via the optional utilization of APIs. This will significantly improve the seller experience and minimize the time needed to manage and maintain Particl listings, which has been a widely requested improvement from Particl Marketplace sellers.</p><p><strong>Marketplace Activities:</strong> This category encompasses all activities related to the marketplace, including order management, customer communication, escrow progression, and more.</p><p>In the end, sellers will be able to carry out all their tasks and activities exclusively from the seller app, without the need for Particl Desktop.</p><h3 id=\"typical-flow\">Typical Flow</h3><p>In order to understand the full potential of what this application enables, let us examine a hypothetical example of how it might be used by a fictitious seller.</p><p>Alice, a dropshipper, has an eCommerce store powered by WooCommerce and is looking to expand her reach by utilizing the Particl Marketplace. She downloads the seller application and, with the help of the remote service manager, is able to seamlessly connect her WooCommerce store and import her full inventory with the press of a button. Additionally, due to a specific WooCommerce plugin she uses which dynamically updates her item prices based on supplier data, she opts to have her inventory on the seller app stay in sync with any changes made on WooCommerce.</p><p>Having imported her inventory, she now configures her Particl Marketplace account preferences. She opts to peg her listing prices to a fixed US dollar valuation, pushing the price update once daily and ensuring that her items stay listed on the marketplace consistently. As a renowned seller in her community with recurring buyers, she also decides to set her escrow rate at 0%. And then, to lock in the value of her sales, she opts to automatically swap PART to USDT when a sale is finalized; she proceeds to the remote services manager and enables a liquidity plugin for that purpose. Finally, she enables a function to automatically accept bids from certain countries to expedite the service she provides to her customers.</p><p>Then, as she receives orders, she can manage them all via the app, including dispatching tracking numbers, messages, and more, all without having to undergo Particl Desktop's extensive setup process.</p><h3 id=\"subsequent-improvements\">Subsequent Improvements</h3><p>The example described above illustrates a few of the advantages sellers will gain in terms of user experience, convenience, and added capabilities via external integrations. But this proposed seller app is merely the first phase of what is ultimately envisioned.</p><p>In later stages, we intend to integrate its range of features into a comprehensive web dashboard, enabling sellers to benefit from its features without requiring a software download.</p><p>We also plan on building a ready-made WooCommerce plugin that provides sellers with the same features of the app, but fed directly into their WooCommerce dashboard. This includes the ability to receive, accept, and manage Particl Marketplace orders inside WooCommerce’s regular dashboard, in addition to sending and receiving messages and other supplementary features. When complete, this will offer sellers the ability to list their inventory on Particl Marketplace with minimal disruption to their regular workflow, a considerable step towards simplifying the acquisition of new sellers.</p><p>This is earmarked as a subsequent stage of the seller app, and requires further exploration. Nevertheless, this should give you a good understanding of the potential that Particl's open, modular, and highly-interconnected architecture provides.</p><p>Ultimately, our goal is to incorporate a lot of these features into the desktop version of Particl Marketplace — which will remain the best solution for those looking for the maximum amount of decentralization and privacy — but first deploying them within a standalone application is a quicker path towards providing sellers with those much-needed improvements.</p><h2 id=\"marketplace-dapp-designed-for-buyers\">Marketplace dApp Designed for Buyers</h2><p>Even with the wide range of features and enhancements to the seller experience, we must not forget that Particl Marketplace is a two-way street. Without buyers, sellers cannot exist, and our plans for improvement would be incomplete without considering both sides of the equation.</p><p>That is why, subsequent to releasing the initial iterations of the seller app, the next step will be to develop a mobile and/or web edition of the marketplace, featuring an entirely redesigned user experience tailored to buyers.</p><p>This will give online purchasers a more straightforward user experience, ridding them of all superfluous vendor-related and technical features they don't need or care about, and making Particl Marketplace more akin to what one would generally expect from an online marketplace, while still benefiting from the advantages associated with its decentralized and privacy-first nature.</p><p>Although the exact features and functions of this app are yet to be determined, we can confidently say that our goal is to provide a buyer experience that is as streamlined and accessible as possible. To that end, we plan to focus on user-friendliness and the intuitiveness of its user interface, wider accessibility through either web browsers or a mobile application (or both), and providing a tailored experience that meets the specific needs of buyers.</p><p>Upon completion of both the buyer and seller applications, Particl's DeCommerce ecosystem will be able to provide privacy, decentralization, and freedom, while minimizing the usual drawbacks associated with those terms. In essence, by simplifying the use of Particl's DeCommerce products, the adoption potential of Particl Marketplace will inevitably be increased, bringing its benefits to as many people as ever.</p><h2 id=\"liquidity-solutions\">Liquidity Solutions</h2><p>Having great products is one thing — however, when it comes to Particl and DeCommerce, the liquidity of the underlying assets (in this case, PART pairs) is of equal importance.</p><p>This is why we are adding a remote services connector to the seller app, to work in tandem with BasicSwap DEX.

You\ncan download and install it now and benefit from the most current and\nstreamlined Particl user experience available.\n\nThis is an important milestone for the desktop client and the project as a\nwhole, as it brings us one step closer to our goal of having a more modular and\nefficient ecosystem.\n\nWe'll delve deeper into this topic in this blog post, so let's get started!\n\n * Download Particl Desktop 3.3: \n   https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSeparation of Particl Core and Desktop ?\nThe major takeaway from this update is the decoupling of the Particl blockchain\nfrom the desktop client.\n\nFrom the outset, Particl Desktop v1.0 was entirely linked with Particl Core.\nThat's because, at the time of its launch, the desktop client lacked the\nmarketplace dApp component and was purely designed as a cryptocurrency wallet.\nTo be more precise, the marketplace itself wasn't initially designed as a\nstandalone dApp, but rather an added set of functionalities to the Particl\nwallet.\n\nAs the years progressed, Particl's vision developed into a more ambitious goal,\nnecessitating an extensive transformation of the desktop client's unified\narchitecture into a more adaptive and flexible design.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.3 makes significant strides towards establishing an\nindependent relationship between Particl Core and the desktop client by\nseparating them entirely, allowing them to coexist and operate harmoniously as\ndistinct pieces of software.\n\nFirst Steps Towards Modularity ⚙️\nThe reasoning behind separating Particl Core and Desktop is the first step\ntowards a more modular, open, and developer-friendly ecosystem. It signals the\nbeginning of the client's transformation from a \"cryptocurrency wallet with\nextra features\" into a fully-fledged sandbox for privacy-first dApps. \n\nThis development is expected to take place through a series of incremental\nchanges all throughout the new development cycle, each update working towards\nachieving our objective of modularity, openness, and enhanced efficiency.\n\nTo learn more about Particl's new (and now current) development cycle, please\nrefer to this extensive blog post\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/] on the topic.\n\nParticl’s Next Evolutionary Leap ForwardLearn about the team’s new major\ndevelopment cycle and discover Particl’s upcoming open-source foundation for\nthe\ndevelopment and deployment of privacy-first dApps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/]General Bug Fixes\nand Improvements ?\nAside from this significant leap forward, this new release introduces a wide\nvariety of improvements, both architecturally and to the user experience. It\nalso and a few bugs and issues. You'll find the full changelog at the bottom of\nthis article. \n\nSeller Companion App is Next ?\nNow that Particl Desktop 3.3 is live on mainnet, work on the seller companion\napp begins. \n\nFor those who may have not seen it yet, here's an excerpt from one of our recent\nweekly development progress reports which outlines its nature and the planned\nfeatures for it.\n\n> The app will serve as an external inventory and order management system tailored\nfor Particl's \"power sellers\". It will enable sellers to create, manage, and\npublish listings, but also set up escrow rates, and manage shipping, orders, and\nchats. We also plan to add plenty of automation into the system — such as the\nauto-relisting of items, automated pricing updates, and auto-acceptance of\norders within specified parameters — to make selling on the marketplace more\nefficient and effortless.\n\nThe application will also allow sellers to connect their Particl inventory to\nexternal platforms, such as WooCommerce, to benefit from its multitude of\nfunctionality and flexible plugins. This will drastically reduce the workload of\nmanually maintaining marketplace content, especially when combined with\nautomated processes, and will make it much easier for sellers already selling\nstuff online to integrate Particl Marketplace as part of the range of platforms\nthey do business on. And of course, we fully expect it to grow the number of\nlistings available on the marketplace!\n\nThe app is set to be rolled out in successive feature updates, a notable step in\nthe direction of making Particl Marketplace more open and accessible, especially\nwhen paired with a web gateway later on during the coming development cycle. \n\nIn reality, it encapsulates the flexibility and cross-platform compatibility of\nParticl's proposed modular architecture, allowing the marketplace to connect\nwith other platforms and reach broader audiences with greater ease.\n\nAlthough this is a small — but important — piece of our marketplace dApp vision,\nit is a great example of what becomes possible with Particl as we progress\nthrough this infrastructural evolutionary phase.\n\nWe aim to make the entire ecosystem more accessible in the near future by\nintegrating new gateways, such as web access, and further developing its\ncomponents into open modules. This will result in Particl dApps being highly\nconvenient, accessible, and much easier to use.\n * Source: Particl Development Progress Report (03-02-2023)\n   [https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-03-02-2023/]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started\n * Download Particl Desktop 3.3: \n   https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0\n\nRelease Particl Desktop v3.3.0 · particl/particl-desktopParticl Desktop\nv3.3.0RELEASE INFORMATION BUILDPARTICL CORE (MIN VERSION)MARKETPLACE\nVERSIONWALLET VERSION 3.3.023.0.30.3.121.8.0 CHANGELOG[overview] [Linux OS]\nApplication name ...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0]For those\nunfamiliar with Particl, we highly recommend exploring the Particl Academy as an\ninformative guide and resource for using Particl Desktop and the Particl\nMarketplace.\n\nOpen Particl Academy [https://academy.particl.io]\n\nNotes\n * Your wallet needs to be unlocked to process buy and sell orders on the\n   marketplace.\n * If you spot any issue, bug, or area of improvement, please report it directly\n   on the Github Issues [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] \n   page.\n\nAdvanced Start-up\nFor those interested, launching the application via the terminal offers\nreal-time log data.

It is not recommended to edit these by hand, but they can\n   be useful if something goes wrong and a setting is unavailable.\n * Completed a significant refactor to help move towards the goal of independent\n   apps/modules in the system (and/or independent blockchain networks).\n * Any attempt o download a new Particl Core binary or start a new binary now\n   occurs after the application has fully started, rather than blocking access\n   to the main application user interface until particl-core has been started.\n * Updated to use Particl Core v23\n\nParticl Core\n * Introduced a new module to allow for the configuration of when and how to\n   start the Particl Core binary/executable.\n * Particl Core will need to be correctly started and accessible in order to\n   access the apps/modules requiring Particl blockchain functionality.\n * Various Particl Core startup configuration options are presented in this\n   module, along with the ability to start or stop a Particl Core node (or\n   connect to an already running node).\n * Note that the settings per chain (mainnet/testnet/regtest) are stored\n   separately, and are updated whenever the chain being connected to is changed\n   (in the Startup menu option).\n * For advanced users, wanting to customize startup further: * the particl-core.json file in the settings directory/folder contains a\n      number of settings per chain (in addition to other settings).\n    * A params key can be placed into the JSON structure of the chain to be\n      configured; this params key should contain a value of an array/list of\n      strings, where each string is the CLI arg of the argument to pass to\n      particl core when starting it. These are not presented in the GUI, but\n      will be applied when attempting to start or connect to the configured\n      Particl chain.\n    * Any incorrect\n      values provided, or an invalid structure, or conflicting params can be\n      viewed in the appropriate log file.\n   \n   \n\nWallet Module\n * Updated after the refactor.\n * Includes minor bug fixes and improvements.\n * Added the ability to export the wallet History to a CSV file.\n * Updated the Settings page: removed the need to click a 'Save' button:\n   settings are now automatically saved once the input loses focus (if the value\n   provided is valid).\n * Added the ability to configure alternative external transaction and address\n   lookup URLs * these are configured according to the Particl chain currently\n      running.\n   \n   \n\nMarketplace dApp\n * Updated after the refactor.\n * Minor fixes and improvements made.\n * Added an indicator to the menu bar to indaicate when the current wallet is\n   locked and order updates may not be processed.\n * Updated the Settings page: removed the need to click a 'Save' button:\n   settings are now automatically saved once the input loses focus (if the value\n   provided is valid).\n * Added the ability to configure alternative external transaction URLs * these\n      are configured according to the Particl chain currently running.\n   \n   \n\nGovernance dApp\n * Updated after the refactor.\n * Minor fixes and improvements made.\n\nDesktop Settings\n * Added the ability to view the Terms and Conditions (not possible previously\n   once they had been accepted after first starting the application).\n * Added the option to toggle whether PD does its own update checks (the URL\n   where updates are queried can be configured in the appropriate settings JSON\n   file: the format of the response needs to be specific, but a script is\n   available to generate and host this file elsewhere if so desired).\n * Included the ability to configure external domains that Particl Desktop can\n   open in the browser. * IMPORTANT! Particl Desktop attempts to prevent unknown external domains\n      from being navigated to, unless they are included in a permitted/allowed\n      list. Some URLs. such as the local machine, the Particl block explorer,\n      and Github, are by default added to this allowed/permitted list. Thus, if\n      any of the transaction or address lookup URLs in the particl wallet or\n      particl market app/modules are changed/customized, ensure that the\n      configured URL (or the domain name at minimum) is also added to this\n      permitted list. Not including the custom domain in the permitted/allowed\n      list will present a prompt indicating that the URL cannot be navigated to.\n   \n   \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith Particl Desktop 3.3 now available on mainnet, we're thrilled to finally\nbegin this new and exciting development cycle poised to significantly improve\nParticl in almost every aspects.\n\nIf you haven't done so already, we, once again, highly recommend reading this\narticle [https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/] which\nextensively details our plans moving forward. \n\nWe are immensely grateful for all the enthusiasm, contributions, and support we\nhave received from the Particl community.

That's because, at the time of its launch, the desktop client lacked the marketplace dApp component and was purely designed as a cryptocurrency wallet. To be more precise, the marketplace itself wasn't initially designed as a standalone dApp, but rather an added set of functionalities to the Particl wallet.</p><p>As the years progressed, Particl's vision developed into a more ambitious goal, necessitating an extensive transformation of the desktop client's unified architecture into a more adaptive and flexible design.</p><p>Particl Desktop 3.3 makes significant strides towards establishing an independent relationship between Particl Core and the desktop client by separating them entirely, allowing them to coexist and operate harmoniously as distinct pieces of software.</p><h2 id=\"first-steps-towards-modularity-\">First Steps Towards Modularity ⚙️</h2><p>The reasoning behind separating Particl Core and Desktop is the first step towards a more modular, open, and developer-friendly ecosystem. It signals the beginning of the client's transformation from a \"cryptocurrency wallet with extra features\" into a fully-fledged sandbox for privacy-first dApps. </p><p>This development is expected to take place through a series of incremental changes all throughout the new development cycle, each update working towards achieving our objective of modularity, openness, and enhanced efficiency.</p><p><strong>To learn more about Particl's new (and now current) development cycle, please refer to <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/\">this extensive blog post</a> on the topic.</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Particl’s Next Evolutionary Leap Forward</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Learn about the team’s new major development cycle and discover Particl’s upcoming open-source foundation for the development and deployment of privacy-first dApps.</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://particl.news/icons/icon-512x512.png\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Particl News</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">cryptoguard</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://particl.news/static/ce0a0b9da50e8a06c5e5f552c168c510/Leap-Forward-Medium.jpg\"></div></a></figure><h2 id=\"general-bug-fixes-and-improvements-\">General Bug Fixes and Improvements ?</h2><p>Aside from this significant leap forward, this new release introduces a wide variety of improvements, both architecturally and to the user experience.

You'll find the full changelog at the bottom of this article. </p><h2 id=\"seller-companion-app-is-next-\">Seller Companion App is Next ?</h2><p>Now that Particl Desktop 3.3 is live on mainnet, work on the seller companion app begins. </p><p>For those who may have not seen it yet, here's an excerpt from one of our recent weekly development progress reports which outlines its nature and the planned features for it.</p><blockquote><em>The app will serve as an external inventory and order management system tailored for Particl's \"power sellers\". It will enable sellers to create, manage, and publish listings, but also set up escrow rates, and manage shipping, orders, and chats. We also plan to add plenty of automation into the system — such as the auto-relisting of items, automated pricing updates, and auto-acceptance of orders within specified parameters — to make selling on the marketplace more efficient and effortless.<br><br>The application will also allow sellers to connect their Particl inventory to external platforms, such as WooCommerce, to benefit from its multitude of functionality and flexible plugins. This will drastically reduce the workload of manually maintaining marketplace content, especially when combined with automated processes, and will make it much easier for sellers already selling stuff online to integrate Particl Marketplace as part of the range of platforms they do business on. And of course, we fully expect it to grow the number of listings available on the marketplace!<br><br>The app is set to be rolled out in successive feature updates, a notable step in the direction of making Particl Marketplace more open and accessible, <strong>especially when paired with a web gateway later on during the coming development cycle. </strong><br><br>In reality, it encapsulates the flexibility and cross-platform compatibility of Particl's proposed modular architecture, allowing the marketplace to connect with other platforms and reach broader audiences with greater ease.<br><br>Although this is a small — but important — piece of our marketplace dApp vision, it is a great example of what becomes possible with Particl as we progress through this infrastructural evolutionary phase.<br><br>We aim to make the entire ecosystem more accessible in the near future by integrating new gateways, such as web access, and further developing its components into open modules.

It also and a few bugs and issues. You'll find the full changelog at the bottom of this article. </p><h2 id=\"seller-companion-app-is-next-\">Seller Companion App is Next ?</h2><p>Now that Particl Desktop 3.3 is live on mainnet, work on the seller companion app begins. </p><p>For those who may have not seen it yet, here's an excerpt from one of our recent weekly development progress reports which outlines its nature and the planned features for it.</p><blockquote><em>The app will serve as an external inventory and order management system tailored for Particl's \"power sellers\". It will enable sellers to create, manage, and publish listings, but also set up escrow rates, and manage shipping, orders, and chats. We also plan to add plenty of automation into the system — such as the auto-relisting of items, automated pricing updates, and auto-acceptance of orders within specified parameters — to make selling on the marketplace more efficient and effortless.<br><br>The application will also allow sellers to connect their Particl inventory to external platforms, such as WooCommerce, to benefit from its multitude of functionality and flexible plugins. This will drastically reduce the workload of manually maintaining marketplace content, especially when combined with automated processes, and will make it much easier for sellers already selling stuff online to integrate Particl Marketplace as part of the range of platforms they do business on. And of course, we fully expect it to grow the number of listings available on the marketplace!<br><br>The app is set to be rolled out in successive feature updates, a notable step in the direction of making Particl Marketplace more open and accessible, <strong>especially when paired with a web gateway later on during the coming development cycle. </strong><br><br>In reality, it encapsulates the flexibility and cross-platform compatibility of Particl's proposed modular architecture, allowing the marketplace to connect with other platforms and reach broader audiences with greater ease.<br><br>Although this is a small — but important — piece of our marketplace dApp vision, it is a great example of what becomes possible with Particl as we progress through this infrastructural evolutionary phase.<br><br>We aim to make the entire ecosystem more accessible in the near future by integrating new gateways, such as web access, and further developing its components into open modules. This will result in Particl dApps being highly convenient, accessible, and much easier to use.</em></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-03-02-2023/\">Particl Development Progress Report (03-02-2023)</a></li></ul><hr><h1 id=\"get-started\">Get Started</h1><ul><li><strong>Download Particl Desktop 3.3: </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0\">https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0</a></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Release Particl Desktop v3.3.0 · particl/particl-desktop</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Particl Desktop v3.3.0RELEASE INFORMATION BUILDPARTICL CORE (MIN VERSION)MARKETPLACE VERSIONWALLET VERSION 3.3.023.0.30.3.121.8.0 CHANGELOG[overview] [Linux OS] Application name ...</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">GitHub</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">particl</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://opengraph.githubassets.com/87973da3f7073618e395ed124d0011477713ef14e46ab261769a4100db957c0d/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0\"></div></a></figure><p>For those unfamiliar with Particl, we highly recommend exploring the Particl Academy as an informative guide and resource for using Particl Desktop and the Particl Marketplace.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><a class=\"btn\" href=\"https://academy.particl.io\" target=\"_blank\">Open Particl Academy</a></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><h1 id=\"notes\"><strong>Notes</strong></h1><ul><li><strong>Your wallet needs to be unlocked to process buy and sell orders on the marketplace.</strong></li><li>If you spot any issue, bug, or area of improvement, please report it directly on the <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\">Github Issues</a> page.</li></ul><h1 id=\"advanced-start-up\"><strong>Advanced Start-up</strong></h1><p>For those interested, launching the application via the terminal offers real-time log data.

Due to changes in the data structure of\nBasicSwap-related SMSG messages, previous instances of the DEX are not\nforward-compatible with this new version. This means that offers posted from\nupdated instances will not appear on older instances. All users must update to\nmaintain full network connectivity.\nAfter 171 commits over 164 files changed coming from 6 different contributors\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/compare/v0.14.3...v0.14.4], we are\nexcited to announce the release of a significant BasicSwap update (v0.14.4)\nalong with an update to its user interface, now at version 3.2.1.\n\nThis substantial update represents weeks of dedicated effort, incorporating\nnumerous improvements, bug fixes, new features, and significant refactors of\ndifferent core components of the system. The changes stem from extensive testing\nby both contributors and community members, resulting in a significant step\nforward for user experience and platform stability.\n\nNoteworthy Updates ?\nWhile this update is massive in scope, many changes are backend changes to\nimprove efficiency, stability, and cross-compatibility. However, several\nsignificant user experience enhancements are worth highlighting.\n\nVarious Coin Core Updates ✅\nWe've made several updates to the various coins available on BasicSwap DEX.\nWhether these updates involve new core versions or integration improvements, we\nhighly recommend updating your node versions as soon as possible.\n\nSignificant UI Refactor ?️\nA major refactoring of the user interface code has occurred over the last couple\nof weeks. While these changes primarily involve code organization and better\npractices that aren't immediately apparent to end users, we've also implemented\nnumerous UI upgrades, including:\n\n * Local reputation tracking\n * Enhanced order book formatting with additional information\n * New Bids page\n * Improved Swaps in Progress page\n * Better Offer pages\n * More responsive and dynamic page behavior\n * Better rate fetching\n * Much more...\n\nThe interface changes since our last version (v0.14.4) are substantial, and\nyou'll miss out on many new features and improvements if you don't update.\n\nClient Authentication ?\nWe've added the ability to configure your BasicSwap instance with client\nauthentication. This feature protects both the webUI and API port access with a\npassword of your choosing. \n\nThis is vital if you're running BasicSwap on a cloud server or using the\nmarket-making companion script in a network environment you don't completely\ntrust. To set up client authentication, please refer to the installation\ndocumentation.\n\nMulti-Net Support ?\nWe've pushed to master the preliminary code for upcoming multi network support\nfor BasicSwap. We've deployed the first phase of a significant infrastructure\nupdate to our networking architecture. This new feature, currently called\n\"multi-net,\" enables BasicSwap to distribute swap, offer, and bid messages\nacross multiple messaging networks beyond SMSG when the primary network\nexperiences high load.\n\nSince all messages adhere to a unified encryption and formatting standard, even\nnon-decentralized networks (such as Telegram or email) could be utilized without\ncompromising user privacy or security.\n\nThis new functionality delivers several key benefits:\n\n 1. Improved platform scalability and resilience\n 2. Greater flexibility for third-party integrations, allowing partners to use\n    their preferred compatible networks for message relay\n 3. Cross-network message compatibility, eliminating the need for users to\n    operate on the same network during swaps\n\nWhile the foundation is now in place, further development is still needed before\nthe implementation becomes fully usable. The current proof of concept using\nSimplex broadcasts messages to the entire group rather than targeting specific\nrecipients — an inefficiency we're addressing given Simplex's limitations.\n\nThe core architecture is designed to extend SMSG functionality across various\nnetworks. All messages maintain SMSG encryption and message IDs for consistency,\nalthough additional work is required to ensure full compatibility of Python SMSG\nmessages across all networks and to add convenience functions for submitting\npre-formed SMSG messages. Currently, this new system pushes to the core through\nP2P connections (for SMSG testing) but doesn't yet join the SMSG and Simplex\nnetworks.\n\nNot to be overlooked is the important advantage of this approach in its\nflexibility regarding network requirements. Since messages are (or will be)\nfully valid SMSG entities, they can be transmitted over plaintext networks like\nTelegram, Delta, or even Pastebin. Email systems supporting POP3/IMAP protocols\nare particularly well-suited for more decentralization-focused users. It's worth\nnoting that centralized options, including Simplex, may still expose some\ninformation pseudonymously about which accounts are communicating with each\nother.\n\nAcceptance Strategy Knowledge ?\nWhen publishing a new offer, the SMSG messages relaying its details to the rest\nof the network now carry information about whether the offer is set to\nautomatically accept bids. This information is also displayed on an offer's page\nbefore submitting a bid, helping you make better-informed decisions about which\noffers to bid on.\n\nPlease note that this change means previous instances of BasicSwap will not be\nable to properly resolve offer messages from up-to-date instances. Updating your\nBasicSwap instance is mandatory to receive all offers from the network. However,\noffer messages from older instances remain compatible with the new version, so\nupgrading now carries no downside.\n\nDocs ?️\nWe've migrated BasicSwap's documentation from the Particl Academy (which uses\nReadTheDocs) to a more maintainable and flexible platform (Docusaurus) at \ndocs.basicswapdex.com [https://docs.basicswapdex.com/docs/intro/]. While we'll\nmaintain the BasicSwap documentation on the Particl Academy, all new updates\nwill be provided at the new location.\n\nInstall the Latest BasicSwap Update ?️\nDue to a significant change in what data is carried in BasicSwap-related\nmessages, it is mandatory to update the DEX. Failure to do so will result in\nyour instance not picking up messages from up-to-date instances.\n\nTo install the new update, which includes both the codebase and user interface\nupdates, simply update BasicSwap through the usual process\n[https://docs.basicswapdex.com/docs/user-guides/update] (video walkthrough\n[https://youtu.be/obxcmEby64s?si=-kFNfEIJx8yQYJhP]) and launch the DEX again.\n\nDocker\n> If you've installed BasicSwap following the Docker method...\n * Shutdown BasicSwap properly and stop the Docker image (docker-compose stop),\n * From the basicswap folder, type the git pull command,\n * In the /docker folder, run the docker-compose build --no-cache command,\n * Once the process completes, launch BasicSwap again using the docker-compose\n   up command.\n\n> Note: Depending on your Docker version, adding a dash between docker and compose \nmay not be necessary and may instead throw an error.\nNon-Docker\n> If you've installed BasicSwap following the non-Docker method...\n * Shutdown BasicSwap properly,\n * From the ~/coinswaps/basicswap folder, type the git pull command,\n * Execute the following command: pip install --require-hashes -r\n   requirements.txt,\n * Execute the following command: pip3 install .,\n * Launch BasicSwap as usual.\n\nInstall Script\n> If you've installed BasicSwap using Nahuhh's Github installation script\n[https://github.com/nahuhh/basicswap-bash/]...\n * Execute the update command: bsx-update && bsx-update.\n\nChangelog ?\nCoin(s)\n * Bitcoin — Added support for Bitcoin descriptor wallets\n * Bitcoin — Update Bitcoins' fast sync blockchain file\n * Bitcoin — Add a workaround to prevent Bitcoin wallets' seeds changing after\n   enabling encryption\n * Bitcoin Cash — Upgraded Bitcoin Cash node to version 28.0.1\n * Bitcoin Cash — Refresh BCH keypool\n * Monero — Upgrade Monero node to version 0.18.4.0\n * Monero — Corrupt Monero wallets are now detected\n * Monero — Remove inaccurate fee rates for Monero and hide sweep all checkbox\n * Monero — Make Monero's fork height a transient error\n * Monero — Sets Monero's trusted_daemon setting to true by default\n * Litecoin — Fixed a bug with MWEB wallet generation\n * PIVX — Fixed issues with PIVX\n * Namecoin — Large array of fixes and improvements to the Namecoin integration\n * Wownero — Fixed Wownero's Windows download URL\n * Fixed a reseed wallet regression error\n\nAPI\n * Better handling of errors with the API\n * Fixed bug with Firo's API\n * Simplified API requests\n * Identities API updated\n * Use CryptoCompare pricemulti endpoint for multiple coins\n * Reduced lookupFiatRates debug message\n\nUI Code\n * Fixed various memory leaks and improved memory efficiency\n * Major UI refactor;

However, several significant user experience enhancements are worth highlighting.</p><h3 id=\"various-coin-core-updates-\">Various Coin Core Updates ✅</h3><p>We've made several updates to the various coins available on BasicSwap DEX.

This feature protects both the webUI and API port access with a password of your choosing. </p><p>This is vital if you're running BasicSwap on a cloud server or using the market-making companion script in a network environment you don't completely trust. To set up client authentication, please refer to the installation documentation.</p><h3 id=\"multi-net-support-\">Multi-Net Support ?</h3><p>We've pushed to <code>master</code> the preliminary code for upcoming multi network support for BasicSwap. We've deployed the first phase of a significant infrastructure update to our networking architecture. This new feature, currently called \"multi-net,\" enables BasicSwap to distribute swap, offer, and bid messages across multiple messaging networks beyond SMSG when the primary network experiences high load.</p><p>Since all messages adhere to a unified encryption and formatting standard, even non-decentralized networks (such as Telegram or email) could be utilized without compromising user privacy or security.</p><p>This new functionality delivers several key benefits:</p><ol><li>Improved platform scalability and resilience</li><li>Greater flexibility for third-party integrations, allowing partners to use their preferred compatible networks for message relay</li><li>Cross-network message compatibility, eliminating the need for users to operate on the same network during swaps</li></ol><p>While the foundation is now in place, further development is still needed before the implementation becomes fully usable. The current proof of concept using Simplex broadcasts messages to the entire group rather than targeting specific recipients — an inefficiency we're addressing given Simplex's limitations.</p><p>The core architecture is designed to extend SMSG functionality across various networks. All messages maintain SMSG encryption and message IDs for consistency, although additional work is required to ensure full compatibility of Python SMSG messages across all networks and to add convenience functions for submitting pre-formed SMSG messages. Currently, this new system pushes to the core through P2P connections (for SMSG testing) but doesn't yet join the SMSG and Simplex networks.</p><p>Not to be overlooked is the important advantage of this approach in its flexibility regarding network requirements. Since messages are (or will be) fully valid SMSG entities, they can be transmitted over plaintext networks like Telegram, Delta, or even Pastebin. Email systems supporting POP3/IMAP protocols are particularly well-suited for more decentralization-focused users. It's worth noting that centralized options, including Simplex, may still expose some information pseudonymously about which accounts are communicating with each other.</p><h3 id=\"acceptance-strategy-knowledge-\">Acceptance Strategy Knowledge ?</h3><p>When publishing a new offer, the SMSG messages relaying its details to the rest of the network now carry information about whether the offer is set to automatically accept bids. This information is also displayed on an offer's page before submitting a bid, helping you make better-informed decisions about which offers to bid on.</p><p>Please note that this change means previous instances of BasicSwap will not be able to properly resolve offer messages from up-to-date instances. Updating your BasicSwap instance is mandatory to receive all offers from the network. However, offer messages from older instances remain compatible with the new version, so upgrading now carries no downside.</p><h3 id=\"docs-\">Docs ?️</h3><p>We've migrated BasicSwap's documentation from the Particl Academy (which uses ReadTheDocs) to a more maintainable and flexible platform (Docusaurus) at <a href=\"https://docs.basicswapdex.com/docs/intro/\">docs.basicswapdex.com</a>.
