There is no third-party or\nintermediary operating it or having any sort of control over its network. It\nuses a mix of P2P and blockchain technologies, meaning that it is exclusively\nrun by its global community of users.\n\nThe Open Marketplace is an equally decentralized application that’s built on top\nof the Particl network. It allows anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and\nservices, physical or digital, regardless of where they are located in the\nworld. And because it is entirely decentralized, there’s no staff or support\nteam to enforce rules and policies.\n\nFurthermore, the Open Marketplace is completely private by default, meaning no\nidentifiable data can be linked to any of its users. Transactions are hidden on\nthe blockchain, images are stripped of their metadata, data exchange is\nencrypted, and you can even connect the marketplace through the Tor network. In\nother words, users of the marketplace are anonymous.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started\nTo download the Particl Open Marketplace, go to https://particl.io/downloads or \nget it directly from Github\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.0.1].\n\nparticl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.0.1]\nYou can't perform that action at this time.

If you have ever run the Particl Open Marketplace on mainnet before, you\n    will need to wipe your existing marketplace database, otherwise, you may\n    encounter errors that will break your experience. The location of your\n    particl-market is dependent on the OS you use.\n\n * Windows:C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Roaming\\particl-market\n * macOS:~/Library/Application Support/particl-market\n * Linux:~/.particl-market\n\n2. To use the marketplace, you need to create a marketplace-enabled wallet. To\ndo that, you need to first create a normal wallet as usual. Then, once that is\ndone, create a second wallet and name in Market. Once generated, that wallet\nwill have the marketplace enabled.\n\nFor a complete tutorial on how to download, install, and setup the Particl Open\nMarketplace, follow this link: \nhttps://particl.news/tutorial-how-to-use-the-private-and-trustless-particl-marketplace-11839ea30e09\n\nFor a Wiki version, follow this link: \nhttps://particl.wiki/prepare-install-marketplace\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to Use the Open Marketplace\nAlthough the Particl Open Marketplace proposes a new and improved way to shop\nand do business online, it isn’t too different than the marketplaces you’re used\nto use.\n\nFor buyers and sellers, the simple process of going through a transaction can be\nsummarized as follow:\n\n * The buyer places an order\n * The seller accepts the order\n * The buyer locks his funds in escrow\n * The seller locks his funds in escrow\n * The seller packages and ships the order. A tracking number can be included at\n   this point\n * The buyer receives the order, inspects it, and marks the transaction as\n   complete\n\nSounds easy? That’s because it is! In fact, the process of purchasing and\nselling something online without sacrificing your data shouldn’t be a chore and\nshould be accessible to as many people as possible. Yet, if you want to have a\nfull breakdown of how to use the Particl Open Marketplace, you can either read \nthis tutorial blog post\n[https://particl.news/understanding-and-use-of-the-particl-marketplace-9866cd8190f5] \nor consult this Wiki step-by-step guide [https://particl.wiki/how-to-buy-sell].\n\nWhat Can You Buy & Sell\nParticl’s Open Marketplace is a two-sided marketplace. By definition, a\ntwo-sided marketplace is a marketplace for “exchange between\n[https://reasonstreet.co/business-model-two-sided-marketplace/]two\n[https://reasonstreet.co/business-model-two-sided-marketplace/] distinct user\ngroups that provide each other with the benefits of a large network\n[https://reasonstreet.co/business-model-two-sided-marketplace/]”.\n\nThat means it is entirely up to the users to figure out what they want to buy\nand what they want to sell, and when demand arises, supply should usually follow\nto fill a void. The best example of a two-sided marketplace is eBay — a\nmarketplace where both sellers and buyers are “customers” of and provide each\nother benefits (the seller provides the buyer with items they’re looking for,\nand the buyer provides the sellers with revenue).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Next?\nThis is only the beginning of a long journey for Particl. This mainnet release,\ndubbed a Beta release, marks the first mainnet iteration of many to come for the\nmarketplace.\n\nIt means a lot of intended features are still not implemented yet, and that a\nlot of improvement will be made along the way. This is why your feedback will be\nextremely valuable. What do you think is missing from this marketplace? How was\nyour experience in a particular situation and how could it be improved?\n\nIn the foreseeable future, the Particl team will be focusing on developing some\nof the core features identified earlier in the year. That includes, but isn’t\nlimited to:\n\n * A mobile application and/or mobile integration\n * The possibility to use other coins on Particl Desktop and/or the marketplace\n * A market management tool allowing for the management of multiple user markets\n * A comment section to allow reviews to be logged in\n * Listing price pegging to allow listings to dynamically adjust their prices in\n   PART\n * And more…\n\nBut for now, it is time to play with the world’s most private and decentralized\nmarketplace as much as possible and observe how it will play out. The Particl\nteam will be on the lookout and will be collecting feedback over the course of\nthe next few days/weeks.\n\nThis important period will certainly help shape the future of the project and\nestablish short to mid-term development priorities.\n\nSo install the marketplace, and let’s get down to business!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-is-Now-Live-on-Mainnet/1-89WBhJh6pZ1PBeAKZB2M3A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>It is finally here!

After years of research, development, fine-tuning, refactoring, and\ncommunity-testing, it is finally ready to be unveiled as the world’s most\ndisruptive and empowering marketplace the world has ever seen.\n\nWhat’s Particl and What’s the Open Marketplace?\nParticl is an entirely decentralized platform. There is no third-party or\nintermediary operating it or having any sort of control over its network. It\nuses a mix of P2P and blockchain technologies, meaning that it is exclusively\nrun by its global community of users.\n\nThe Open Marketplace is an equally decentralized application that’s built on top\nof the Particl network. It allows anyone in the world to buy and sell goods and\nservices, physical or digital, regardless of where they are located in the\nworld. And because it is entirely decentralized, there’s no staff or support\nteam to enforce rules and policies.\n\nFurthermore, the Open Marketplace is completely private by default, meaning no\nidentifiable data can be linked to any of its users. Transactions are hidden on\nthe blockchain, images are stripped of their metadata, data exchange is\nencrypted, and you can even connect the marketplace through the Tor network. In\nother words, users of the marketplace are anonymous.\n\nWhat’s important to note, though, is that the Open Marketplace is still very\ndeep into its development phase. In fact, this mainnet release will mark the\nbeginning of the Beta phase of development. Whereas the Alpha phase was mostly\nfocused on building the base layer of the marketplace, Beta will be about adding\nvarious features on top of it and make it more appealing and easy to use for\nvarious types of vendors and buyers.\n\nSo what does it mean? What will you be able to do with Particl’s Open\nMarketplace once it first comes out? What are going to be the available\nfeatures? This blog post will explain, in details, everything you need to know\nprior to the marketplace releasing on mainnet.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSlick, Modern, and User-Friendly Interface\nOne of the most important aspect of any marketplace or product is the user\ninterface and how easy and seamless it is to use. No matter how many great\nfeatures a marketplace has, consumers will opt for a simpler option if it is too\ndifficult use or too time-consuming to learn.\n\nAnd so, with this in mind, the Particl team has put tremendous focus on the Open\nMarketplace’s user experience and interface. In fact, the marketplace is\nintegrated directly into Particl Desktop, the network’s flagship client, and is\ndesigned in a way that makes it easy for everyone to quickly understand how it\nworks. Forget the usual boring and ugly look of cryptocurrency wallets — the\nOpen Marketplace is not only very pleasant to the eye, it is also a very\nintuitive platform that won’t require you to pull all of the hair out of your\nhead just to figure out how to make it work.\n\nYes, this first version mainnet of the marketplace is a Beta build. Yes, there\nare definitely a lot of improvements that are going to be made so that it can be\n“grandma-friendly”, but as Particl always strives to improve its products on all\naspects, and as UI/UX is one of the top focus of the team, it will keep getting\nbetter and more intuitive over time. According to today’s crypto standards,\nParticl Desktop is damn sexy, but the team’s target is set much higher than just\nbeing “good enough” for the crypto crowd.\n\nBuy Stuff for Crypto\n * No fee\n * No identifiable data generated or collected by any 3rd-party\n * No registration or account creation\n * Full escrow support\n * Untraceable currency transactions\n\nIt is already possible to buy many things with cryptocurrencies, but most\noptions are full of friction and they introduce third-parties back in the game.\nThese options either require you to (1) pay a hefty fee, (2) go through many\nsteps and account registrations, or (3) sacrifice your personal data to some\ncompany.\n\nIn most cases, these options introduce all of the above mentioned issues. In all\ncases, the re-introduction of third-parties into the process is proving to be\nhighly counter-productive and more troublesome than simply spending traditional\ncurrencies. Didn’t we start using Bitcoin because we wanted to get rid of\nmiddlemen? Then, why should we have to crawl back to them when we want to spend\nour coins?\n\nParticl fixes all of that in one big swoop by providing a private-by-default\nmarketplace that allows anyone to safely buy products and services online and\npay for them using cryptocurrencies, but without having to deal with any of the\nthree issues introduced by third-parties mentioned just above. After all,\nBitcoin was initially created to be an ecosystem that’s entirely independent\nfrom third-parties, as demonstrated by Satoshi’s early attempt at building a\ndecentralized marketplace on top of the Bitcoin codebase\n[https://news.bitcoin.com/satoshis-pre-release-bitcoin-code-contains-some-fascinating-findings/]\n.\n\nThe Open Marketplace is entirely decentralized and autonomous, meaning it\ndoesn’t rely on any third-party to operate. The absence of any third-party means\nthat you do not have to pay any fee or sacrifice your personal data in order to\nbe able to use cryptocurrencies as actual currencies.\n\nFor the buyer, that means you will likely get access to more affordable products\nsince vendors do not need to pay any fee, except for a small anti-spam listing\nfee. Keep in mind that some online vendors need to pay as high as 40% fee per\nsale, once every fee is paid. Sometimes, that’s even more. That is always\nreflected in the final price that we all pay when shopping online.\n\nSave time and energy by instantly and directly connecting with vendors that\nalready accept cryptocurrencies. Gone are the days you needed to continually\nbrowse the internet to find a vendor that sells the product you are looking\nfor…and accepts cryptocurrencies at the same time.\n\nSell Stuff for Crypto\n * No fee, except for a small listing fee of a few cents\n * No identifiable data generated or collected by any 3rd-party\n * No registration or account creation\n * Full escrow support\n * Untraceable currency transactions\n\nNow, what if you would like to sell some stuff and accept cryptocurrencies? What\nif you wanted to make a business out of it? There are a few options available,\nbut just like for buyers, they require the assistance of third-parties to\nfunction. This introduces a lot of issues for vendors such as (1) paying very\nhigh fees, (2) requiring a lot of paperwork and sign ups, and (3) sacrificing\nyour business data to some company.\n\nThanks to its decentralized structure, the Open Marketplace fixes the issues\nmentioned above by allowing sellers to earn cryptocurrencies by putting products\nand services up for sale on the platform, but without using of any third-party\nor company. The only fee sellers are required to pay, aside from the usual\ncryptocurrency transaction fee, is a small anti-spam listing fee of a few cents\nper day. Everything else is at a big fat 0% fee. For most people selling online,\nthis is about as big of as deal as it gets!\n\nImagine you’re a seller and paying something like 40% fee per transaction, or\neven “just” 15%. Suddenly being charged ~0% on your sales represents a huge\nopportunity and can change your business around in a major way. Not only can you\nmake much more profit per sale, but you can also reduce your prices to gain a\nnet advantage over your competitors.\n\nAnd, since the Open Marketplace is a crypto-focused two-sided marketplace,\nmeaning the platform is populated by both active sellers and buyers, it is the\nideal place to sell items for cryptocurrencies without having to waste hours\nfinding a target audience that is not only looking for your product, but also\nwilling to spend cryptocurrencies for it.\n\nDouble Deposit Escrow System\nParticl Wiki — Double Deposit Escrow System\n[https://particl.wiki/marketplace#decentralized_escrow]\nParticl's Open Marketplace is a decentralized marketplace built with privacy at\nits core. It offers a low-cost, secure…\n[https://particl.wiki/marketplace#decentralized_escrow]particl.wiki\n[https://particl.wiki/marketplace#decentralized_escrow]\n\n * No fee, except for the usual cryptocurrency transaction fee\n * Infinitely scalable\n * No identifiable data generated or collected by any 3rd-party\n * Privacy-focused\n\nUnlike other marketplaces, the Open Marketplace uses a fee-less and\ndecentralized type of escrow (or resolution center). Just like the rest of the\nplatform, this escrow system doesn’t rely on any third-party for issues to be\nresolved.\n\nIn fact, the Open Marketplace’s escrow system is based on the Mutually Assured\nDestruction (MAD) game-theory and requires both sellers and buyers to make a\nsecurity deposit, on top of the regular payment, into a smart-contract. The\nsecurity deposits are refunded, in full, to the participants when both of them\nmark the transaction as complete.\n\nNot requiring any third-party for the escrow system dramatically increases\nprivacy since no escrow agent can have access to your transaction details,\nconversation history, and tracking information. It allows you to own your data\nby ensuring that none of it can be collected by any party other than the one you\nare transacting with.\n\nParticl’s double deposit escrow system is also almost free to use. Unlike most\neCommerce platform, protecting yourself from a party you do not know or trust\nwon’t require you to pay anything other than a simple cryptocurrency transaction\nfee.\n\nAs a comparison, some marketplaces and online commerce platforms will charge you\na considerable fee, sometimes as high as 20% per transaction, just for using an\nescrow or mediation service. These fees tend to be higher on B2B-focused\nmarketplaces.\n\nTake Your Privacy Back\nParticl Explained - Private Transactions\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd]\nAnonymous transactions, or Anon transactions, as referred to in Particl\nDesktop,\ntake privacy to the next level by not…\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd]\n\n * Untraceable currency transactions\n * No metadata when uploading files (i.e. listing pictures)\n * No identifiable data generated\n * No account creation, registration, or KYC required\n * IP addresses can easily be hidden\n\nYou would think that a decentralized marketplace that doesn’t require any\nthird-party, at any step of the process, would be better at keeping your data\nprivate. That, unfortunately, couldn’t be further from the truth.\n\nIn fact, blockchains are publicly auditable ledgers that permanently record your\ndata. And while data written on a blockchain is usually pseudonymous, it is\nentirely possible to collect, analyze, decipher, and use it. Blockchain analysis\nfirms are getting exponentially better at mining and deciphering data stored on\nblockchains. Some of the largest crypto companies are even doing it out in the\nopen\n[https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/a3bn5e/coinbase-neutrino-former-hacking-team-members]\n. In other words, if you’re worried about how your data is being collected and\nused (hint: and you should be), using a public blockchain might not be ideal for\nyou.\n\nThat’s precisely why the Open Marketplace is private by default. That means you\nwon’t need to do any extra step to protect your privacy and your data won’t be\nout there on a public blockchain for everyone to see and decipher, at any point\nin time. Particl’s Open Marketplace does it all for you.\n\nBy integrating the Confidential Transactions (CT) and RingCT privacy protocols\ninto Particl’s double deposit escrow system, all currency transactions are\nhidden on the blockchain and can’t be traced back to users. Additionally, all\ndata uploaded on the marketplace is stripped of all its metadata so that it\ncan’t be reverse engineered (did you know most pictures taken by phones usually\ncontain a geo-tag?).\n\nThe only privacy enhancing feature that is not enabled by default is the Tor\nnetwork integration. While easy and very quick to set up\n[http://particl.wiki/tor-hs], it requires users to manually enable it. That’s\nbecause pushing automatic updates introduces security vulnerabilities,\nespecially man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.\n\nDecentralized Marketplace Moderation\nParticl Explained - Decentralized Marketplace Moderation\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-decentralized-marketplace-moderation-7daa3c75d5b2]\nTo vote against a specific listing, users need to flag it using the Open\nMarketplace user interface. Once the first…\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-decentralized-marketplace-moderation-7daa3c75d5b2]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-decentralized-marketplace-moderation-7daa3c75d5b2]\n\n * 1 coin = 1 vote\n * Delisting threshold is -9,000 coin weight\n * Provably verifiable\n * Cannot be gamed or produce fake votes\n * No staff with special access or power involved\n\nUsually, to keep marketplaces free of undesirable content, companies use an army\nof moderators and dedicated staff to delete listings and ban users. In the case\nof the Open Marketplace, however, that is impossible as there is no third-party\ninvolved.\n\nParticl instead built a completely decentralized governance mechanism, based on\ngame-theory, that allows anyone in the community to flag undesirable content off\nof the marketplace. The system uses a similar model as the very well known\nReddit model — any user can upvote or downvote a listing, and when it reaches a\ncertain negative threshold, that listing gets deleted from the marketplace. But\nunlike Reddit’s system, which is based on a 1 user = 1 vote basis, the Open\nMarketplace uses a 1 coin = 1 vote basis.\n\nThis system ensures that the Open Marketplace stays clean by employing what can\neffectively become the world’s largest community of moderators. It also ensures\nthat only the users of the platform have an actual say on what content gets to\nstay on there, avoiding troll armies and ill-intended individuals.\n\n> Note: On this first mainnet version of the Particl Open Marketplace, a listing\nwill get taken down entirely once it reaches a negative threshold of -9,000.\nCommunity Proposals\nDecentralized Project Governance Update\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6]\nAs we’ve highlighted in our third Community Update, the Particl team has begun\nworking on the initial version of the…\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6]\n\n * 1 coin = 1 vote\n * Anyone can submit proposals to the community\n * Anyone can vote on proposals\n\nUsing the same system that powers the decentralized moderation system, any\nParticl user can create or vote on a proposal using the Particl Desktop client.\nThis introduces a lot of opportunities for buyers, vendors, and cryptocurrency\nusers.\n\nFor example, this system could be used to reach community consensus on important\ndecisions related to the project. The community could vote on initiatives to\nfund using the common Community Fund\n[https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/address.dws?RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM.htm]\n. Vendors could also make use of this feature to poll their customer base about\nwhat type of product they should be focusing. The possibilities are endless and\nit is entirely up to the community to use the system as they please.\n\nAnd just like the decentralized moderation system, each user carries its own\nvoting weight, as determined by the number of coins they hold. This ensures only\nthose with a stake in the project can have a voice, a concept not too different\nfrom the stakeholder concept in publicly traded companies.\n\nMulti-wallets\nMulti-Wallets on Particl Desktop\n[https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076]\nMulti-wallets are not new to Particl. In fact, they have been available on\nParticl-Qt ever since Particl forked to…\n[https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076]particl.news\n[https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076]\n\nReleasing on mainnet at the same time as the Particl Open Marketplace,\nmulti-wallets allow you to manage multiple wallets within the same Particl\nDesktop environment. In this case, multi-wallets can be compared to ‘user\naccounts’ that are completely independent from each other.\n\nMulti-wallets enable a much better degree of security and privacy as each wallet\nis entirely isolated from the others. That means no information or data\n(purchases, profiles, sales data, transaction details, and etc) can leak from a\nwallet to another. It is impossible, simply by looking into the blockchain, that\ntwo wallets are hosted under the same Particl Desktop instance unless the owner\nof the two wallets has linked them together by making payments to an address\nalready identified as belonging to that user.\n\nMulti-wallets can also be used to manage various profiles on the marketplace,\nseller or buyer, and completely keep your identity private between each of the\nwallets. However, market management and market user management tools will come\nat a later time during the Beta phase of development and won’t be part of the\ninitial mainnet version of the marketplace.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith all of that being said, the Particl Open Marketplace will be the first\nprivacy-focused decentralized marketplace of its kind to ever see the day and\nwill mark an important milestone in the history of online eCommerce. It will go\nlive, on mainnet, on the 12th of August 2019 and will include all features\nmentioned in this blog post.\n\nBut don’t get too complacent, this is just the beginning of one very epic\njourney in disrupting one of the biggest sector of the global economy. This\nrelease will also mark the beginning of the Open Marketplace’s Beta phase of\ndevelopment, and it will only get more interesting and exciting from here on\nout. Moving forward, you can expect many more features to be included to it,\nmaking it a real behemoth in both the blockchain and eCommerce worlds. You can\nalso expect more users to start using it, as well as more third-party\nintegrations to see the day. Suffice to say, there’s a lot of good stuff coming\nup for Particl, and each milestone that will be reached from this point onward\nwill be more exciting than the previous one.\n\nBuckle up, because this train is finally getting moving, and there ain’t no\nstopping after it gets released out in the open!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace---What-to-Expect-on-Day-1/1-gAK1frBqYBuhi6WzZZpftg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Particl’s Open Marketplace is finally just a few days away, within an arm’s reach!

That, unfortunately, couldn’t be further from the truth.</p><p>In fact, blockchains are publicly auditable ledgers that permanently record your data. And while data written on a blockchain is usually pseudonymous, it is entirely possible to collect, analyze, decipher, and use it. Blockchain analysis firms are getting exponentially better at mining and deciphering data stored on blockchains. <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/a3bn5e/coinbase-neutrino-former-hacking-team-members\"><strong>Some of the largest crypto companies are even doing it out in the open</strong></a>. In other words, if you’re worried about how your data is being collected and used (hint: and you should be), using a public blockchain might not be ideal for you.</p><p>That’s precisely why the Open Marketplace is private by default. That means you won’t need to do any extra step to protect your privacy and your data won’t be out there on a public blockchain for everyone to see and decipher, at any point in time. Particl’s Open Marketplace does it all for you.</p><p>By integrating the <strong>Confidential Transactions (CT)</strong> and <strong>RingCT</strong> privacy protocols into Particl’s double deposit escrow system, all currency transactions are hidden on the blockchain and can’t be traced back to users. Additionally, all data uploaded on the marketplace is stripped of all its metadata so that it can’t be reverse engineered (did you know most pictures taken by phones usually contain a geo-tag?).</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HXRFYcg45Aw?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><strong>The only privacy enhancing feature that is not enabled by default is the Tor network integration.</strong> While <a href=\"http://particl.wiki/tor-hs\">easy and very quick to set up</a>, it requires users to manually enable it.

In the case of the Open Marketplace, however, that is impossible as there is no third-party involved.</p><p>Particl instead built a completely decentralized governance mechanism, based on game-theory, that allows anyone in the community to flag undesirable content off of the marketplace. The system uses a similar model as the very well known Reddit model — any user can upvote or downvote a listing, and when it reaches a certain negative threshold, that listing gets deleted from the marketplace. But unlike Reddit’s system, which is based on a 1 user = 1 vote basis, the Open Marketplace uses a 1 coin = 1 vote basis.</p><p>This system ensures that the Open Marketplace stays clean by employing what can effectively become the world’s largest community of moderators. It also ensures that only the users of the platform have an actual say on what content gets to stay on there, avoiding troll armies and ill-intended individuals.</p><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>On this first mainnet version of the Particl Open Marketplace, a listing will get taken down entirely once it reaches a negative threshold of -9,000.</blockquote><h2 id=\"community-proposals\">Community Proposals</h2><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\"><strong>Decentralized Project Governance Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\"><em>As we’ve highlighted in our third Community Update, the Particl team has begun working on the initial version of the…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\">particl.news</a></p><ul><li><strong>1 coin = 1 vote</strong></li><li><strong>Anyone can submit proposals to the community</strong></li><li><strong>Anyone can vote on proposals</strong></li></ul><p>Using the same system that powers the decentralized moderation system, any Particl user can create or vote on a proposal using the Particl Desktop client. This introduces a lot of opportunities for buyers, vendors, and cryptocurrency users.</p><p>For example, this system could be used to reach community consensus on important decisions related to the project. The community could vote on initiatives to fund using the common <a href=\"https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/address.dws?RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM.htm\">Community Fund</a>. Vendors could also make use of this feature to poll their customer base about what type of product they should be focusing. The possibilities are endless and it is entirely up to the community to use the system as they please.</p><p>And just like the decentralized moderation system, each user carries its own voting weight, as determined by the number of coins they hold. This ensures only those with a stake in the project can have a voice, a concept not too different from the stakeholder concept in publicly traded companies.</p><h2 id=\"multi-wallets\">Multi-wallets</h2><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076\"><strong>Multi-Wallets on Particl Desktop</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076\"><em>Multi-wallets are not new to Particl.

In this case, multi-wallets can be compared to ‘user accounts’ that are completely independent from each other.</p><p>Multi-wallets enable a much better degree of security and privacy as each wallet is entirely isolated from the others. That means no information or data (purchases, profiles, sales data, transaction details, and etc) can leak from a wallet to another. It is impossible, simply by looking into the blockchain, that two wallets are hosted under the same Particl Desktop instance unless the owner of the two wallets has linked them together by making payments to an address already identified as belonging to that user.</p><p>Multi-wallets can also be used to manage various profiles on the marketplace, seller or buyer, and completely keep your identity private between each of the wallets. However, market management and market user management tools will come at a later time during the Beta phase of development and won’t be part of the initial mainnet version of the marketplace.</p><hr><p>With all of that being said, the Particl Open Marketplace will be the first privacy-focused decentralized marketplace of its kind to ever see the day and will mark an important milestone in the history of online eCommerce. <strong>It will go live, on mainnet, on the 12th of August 2019 and will include all features mentioned in this blog post.</strong></p><p>But don’t get too complacent, this is just the beginning of one very epic journey in disrupting one of the biggest sector of the global economy. This release will also mark the beginning of the Open Marketplace’s Beta phase of development, and it will only get more interesting and exciting from here on out. Moving forward, you can expect many more features to be included to it, making it a real behemoth in both the blockchain and eCommerce worlds. You can also expect more users to start using it, as well as more third-party integrations to see the day. Suffice to say, there’s a lot of good stuff coming up for Particl, and each milestone that will be reached from this point onward will be more exciting than the previous one.</p><p>Buckle up, because this train is finally getting moving, and there ain’t no stopping after it gets released out in the open!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace---What-to-Expect-on-Day-1/1-cx5kMA6I0j5UIUCKprYfuQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure>","url":"http://localhost:2368/particl-open-marketplace-what-to-expect-on-day-1-c7dd46c46db/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"52b9ba6d-6648-44f4-b2ac-60b858d8d19a","codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5f7e4ca61a93b603e3f767bb","reading_time":11,"send_email_when_published":false,"email_subject":null,"childHtmlRehype":{"html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace---What-to-Expect-on-Day-1/1-gAK1frBqYBuhi6WzZZpftg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Particl’s Open Marketplace is finally just a few days away, within an arm’s reach!

In the case of the Open Marketplace, however, that is impossible as there is no third-party involved.</p><p>Particl instead built a completely decentralized governance mechanism, based on game-theory, that allows anyone in the community to flag undesirable content off of the marketplace. The system uses a similar model as the very well known Reddit model — any user can upvote or downvote a listing, and when it reaches a certain negative threshold, that listing gets deleted from the marketplace. But unlike Reddit’s system, which is based on a 1 user = 1 vote basis, the Open Marketplace uses a 1 coin = 1 vote basis.</p><p>This system ensures that the Open Marketplace stays clean by employing what can effectively become the world’s largest community of moderators. It also ensures that only the users of the platform have an actual say on what content gets to stay on there, avoiding troll armies and ill-intended individuals.</p><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>On this first mainnet version of the Particl Open Marketplace, a listing will get taken down entirely once it reaches a negative threshold of -9,000.</blockquote><h2 id=\"community-proposals\">Community Proposals</h2><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\"><strong>Decentralized Project Governance Update</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\"><em>As we’ve highlighted in our third Community Update, the Particl team has begun working on the initial version of the…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\">particl.news</a></p><ul><li><strong>1 coin = 1 vote</strong></li><li><strong>Anyone can submit proposals to the community</strong></li><li><strong>Anyone can vote on proposals</strong></li></ul><p>Using the same system that powers the decentralized moderation system, any Particl user can create or vote on a proposal using the Particl Desktop client. This introduces a lot of opportunities for buyers, vendors, and cryptocurrency users.</p><p>For example, this system could be used to reach community consensus on important decisions related to the project. The community could vote on initiatives to fund using the common <a href=\"https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/address.dws?RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM.htm\">Community Fund</a>. Vendors could also make use of this feature to poll their customer base about what type of product they should be focusing. The possibilities are endless and it is entirely up to the community to use the system as they please.</p><p>And just like the decentralized moderation system, each user carries its own voting weight, as determined by the number of coins they hold. This ensures only those with a stake in the project can have a voice, a concept not too different from the stakeholder concept in publicly traded companies.</p><h2 id=\"multi-wallets\">Multi-wallets</h2><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076\"><strong>Multi-Wallets on Particl Desktop</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/multi-wallets-on-particl-desktop-5c0c80e94076\"><em>Multi-wallets are not new to Particl.

In this case, multi-wallets can be compared to ‘user accounts’ that are completely independent from each other.</p><p>Multi-wallets enable a much better degree of security and privacy as each wallet is entirely isolated from the others. That means no information or data (purchases, profiles, sales data, transaction details, and etc) can leak from a wallet to another. It is impossible, simply by looking into the blockchain, that two wallets are hosted under the same Particl Desktop instance unless the owner of the two wallets has linked them together by making payments to an address already identified as belonging to that user.</p><p>Multi-wallets can also be used to manage various profiles on the marketplace, seller or buyer, and completely keep your identity private between each of the wallets. However, market management and market user management tools will come at a later time during the Beta phase of development and won’t be part of the initial mainnet version of the marketplace.</p><hr><p>With all of that being said, the Particl Open Marketplace will be the first privacy-focused decentralized marketplace of its kind to ever see the day and will mark an important milestone in the history of online eCommerce. <strong>It will go live, on mainnet, on the 12th of August 2019 and will include all features mentioned in this blog post.</strong></p><p>But don’t get too complacent, this is just the beginning of one very epic journey in disrupting one of the biggest sector of the global economy. This release will also mark the beginning of the Open Marketplace’s Beta phase of development, and it will only get more interesting and exciting from here on out. Moving forward, you can expect many more features to be included to it, making it a real behemoth in both the blockchain and eCommerce worlds. You can also expect more users to start using it, as well as more third-party integrations to see the day. Suffice to say, there’s a lot of good stuff coming up for Particl, and each milestone that will be reached from this point onward will be more exciting than the previous one.</p><p>Buckle up, because this train is finally getting moving, and there ain’t no stopping after it gets released out in the open!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace---What-to-Expect-on-Day-1/1-cx5kMA6I0j5UIUCKprYfuQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":["kg-card","kg-image-card"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace---What-to-Expect-on-Day-1/1-gAK1frBqYBuhi6WzZZpftg.jpeg","className":["kg-image"],"alt":""},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Particl’s Open Marketplace is finally just a few days away, within an arm’s reach!

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
