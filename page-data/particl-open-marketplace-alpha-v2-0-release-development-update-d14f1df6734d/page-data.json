The Particl Open Marketplace Alpha V2.0 has just been\nreleased on Github and is now available for all to play with.\n\nThis version is going to be unlike other testnet versions we’ve seen in the\nrecent past. Unlike our testing community builds that expire after 10 days, this\nstable build will be available for download on the website, as well as in the \nRelease [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/] page of our\nParticl Desktop Github repository.\n\nThis is also the build that the team will be demonstrating at next week’s \nTOKEN2049 conference\n[https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b] \n in Hong Kong.\n\nWe’d also like to take this opportunity to give you all a small update on Alpha,\nBeta, and the upcoming mainnet release of the marketplace! But first, let’s get\ndown to the details about this testnet release.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started With V2.0\nDownload and get started with testing the Open Marketplace by following this\nGithub link:\n\nparticl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha]\nParticl Angular GUI - The source for the Particl GUI. - particl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha]\n\n> Client Version: 2.0.0-alpha-testnetMarket: v0.0.51\nParticl Core: v0.18.0.4\n\nTestnet Faucet (get free testnet coins): http://faucet.particl.xyz/\n\nPlease, continue logging any issue you may encounter on the Issue section\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] of our Github page.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nImportant Note\nFor those of you that have tested the marketplace on testnet a long time before, \nyou will need to wipe your existing marketplace database, otherwise, you will\nencounter errors. This will be sorted out in the future but is highly\nrecommended for the moment.\n\nIf you’ve been testing the more recent marketplace community builds, then that\nstep shouldn’t be necessary anymore, although if you encounter any problem,\nclearing your marketplace database is always a good option to fix most issues.\n\nThe location of your particl-market is dependent on the OS you use.\n\nWindows:C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Roaming\\particl-market\n\nmacOS:~/Library/Application Support/particl-market\n\nLinux:~/.particl-market\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChangelog\n * New logo\n * Bug fixes\n * Stability improvements\n * No download link expiry\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSoft Rebrand\nAs we are moving forward, the project is going to go through a soft rebrand,\nwith today’s release being the first step towards that process. As you probably\nnoticed, this marketplace build now features a brand new logo instead of the old\none. The soft rebrand refreshes the color palette and logo of the project. We\nwill be releasing another blog post later today explaining the details of this\nsoft rebrand and the reasoning behind it.\n\nAlpha, Beta, and the Way Forward\nEarlier this week, we mentioned we were targeting today to be the final date for\nthe Alpha version. This was intended to be this way so that we could time the\nend of the Alpha phase of development with the TOKEN2049 conference. However,\nwhile a portion of our developers was fixing bugs and improving the stability of\nthe build, the other portion made some significant progress on a couple of other\nfeatures that we would like to integrate into Alpha.\n\nFor this reason, we have taken the decision to extend the Alpha phase of\ndevelopment for a few days in order to bring these features on the Alpha build\nand ensure that they are part of our first mainnet version. These features are:\n\n * Multi-wallet capabilities\n * Blinded escrow\n * OMP Library\n\nMulti-wallet: This feature adds the ability to manage multiple wallets within\nthe same Particl Desktop instance. This is useful for both usability and, most\nimportantly, security. Wallets managed by the same unique Particl Desktop are\nentirely isolated from each other, meaning no data is shared between wallets.\nThis will allow buyers, vendors, and users to set multiple profiles and enhance\ntheir security setup.\n\nBlinded escrow: While RingCT and Bulletproofs are available on testnet, they are\nnot available on mainnet. For this reason, and because we’re first and foremost\na privacy project, we’ve opted to integrate CT transactions right into Particl’s\nescrow. Because we already had an escrow system integrated with RingCT on\nRegtest (pre-testnet), we’ve decided to substitute RingCT for CT and bring that\nmodification onto testnet. Progress made on that front has been super fast, and\nfor this reason, we’ve decided to launch our first mainnet version with CT\nescrow enabled by default, effectively making the Open Marketplace private by\ndefault from Day 1. This won’t be as strong as RingCT escrow, but it sure is\nmultiple times more private than a simple pseudonymous escrow setup.\n\nOMP Library: The OMP Library is a protocol that brings various enhancements and\nattributes to the back-end of the marketplace. It is a requirement to\nsuccessfully implement CT escrows and also adds a couple of security-related\nenhancements to it. The attributes it adds will be able to be leveraged by\nParticl Desktop in the future to put more information in listings and better\ncategorize products. For more information about the OMP Library, head over to\nits documentation by following this link: \nhttps://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/\n\nBeta & Mainnet\nFollowing the implementation of these features, Alpha will end and Beta will\nstart immediately thereafter. At the same time, Alpha will move up to mainnet as\na private by default marketplace from Day 1. This Alpha phase of development\nextension shouldn’t affect the targeted release timeframe for mainnet too much,\nif at all, but it will bring features that will significantly increase the value\nand privacy of the product itself. In other words, we are still aiming for a\nmainnet release before the end of Q1 2019.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith all of this in mind, stay tuned for a new testnet build that should contain\nthe newly introduced multi-wallet feature within the next week or so. In the\nmeantime, you can now enjoy the super Particl Open Marketplace V2.0 and share it\nwith your friends and peers without any fear that the links might expire!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Open-Marketplace-Alpha-V2-0-Release---Development-Update/1-4UH5cHbZBKAPH1DIlBuatw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p><strong>It’s finally here!</strong> The Particl Open Marketplace Alpha V2.0 has just been released on Github and is now available for all to play with.</p><p>This version is going to be unlike other testnet versions we’ve seen in the recent past.

This exile away from Slack was due to\nthe overwhelming amount of spam we used to receive on the platform, and since\nthat time, the community has been split in between using Telegram, Discord, and\nRiot — with our trusty bot “Rutherford” connecting all of the conversations\ntogether in real time.\n\nWhile it is accommodating, this setup isn’t ideal and it also carries its load\nof pickles. For one, it makes spam more time-consuming to deal with, each spam\npost is required to be deleted on all three platforms. It also makes\ninteractions and communications less interesting due to how posts from other\nplatforms are displayed and formatted. Then there’s the issue of always being\nrequired to maintain the Rutherford bot which tends to break from time to time.\n\nOn top of this, and perhaps more importantly, there’s the inconvenience where we\ncan’t really make the chatrooms as awesome as they could be by using bots since\neveryone’s on different platforms; bots sometimes don’t communicate or simply\ncannot interact, by nature, with users on different platforms.\n\nFor these and other reasons, we’ve made the decision to officially move over to\nDiscord and methodically reduce resources on Riot and Telegram slowly over time. \nIn 7 days, starting from today, the Telegram channels will be put in read-only\nmode. This should incentivize the remaining Telegram users to move over while\nstill allowing new Telegram users to discover the project and read the\nconversations.\n\nParticl - Discord Me [https://discord.me/particl]\nOfficial server for the Particl project. Particl is a blockchain project\nbuilding a new independent and decentralized… [https://discord.me/particl]\ndiscord.me [https://discord.me/particl]\n\nWhat Will Improve?\nThe time is right to move exclusively to Discord. With the release of the Open\nMarketplace being imminent, we anticipate an uptick in new users joining our\nawesome community. Serving new users on one platform instead of many will make\neveryone’s user experience much better and will allow us to do much more. Here’s\na quick list of what the move to Discord will look like and — more\nimportantly — what opportunities it opens up. Note that this list is obviously\nnot complete, and new stuff will be added as we march forward.\n\nBetter User Experience\nThis is probably the most obvious benefit we’ll get from moving exclusively to\none platform. Interacting on many different platforms at the same time\ndefinitely reduces the user experience by making much less appealing and,\nfrankly, more confusing — especially to newcomers coming into our community and\nnot being used to see bots responding instead of real people.\n\nLet’s face it, linking platforms has many downsides. Bot conversations are\nconfusing chains of replies to users on different platforms, images struggle\nuploading properly everywhere at the same time. The various different Particl\nchannels, each with their unique URL and mixed between other crypto channels on\nTelegram is also pretty chaotic.\n\nDiscord will fix all of the above by providing a clean and structured interface\nthat will go a long way in enhancing the quality of interactions and make\neverything more fun and intuitive.\n\nFight Off Spammers\nSpam on Telegram is off the rails!\n\nEvery day, we see fake accounts joining the many channels and spamming them with\nseriously questionable content or “business proposals”. And it’s not like we\ndon’t fight back. Even though our Telegram channels have three different bots\nspecifically dedicated to filtering these kinds of unwanted posts, spam still\nhappens at a pretty regular rate.\n\nDiscord simply offers more tools and ways to fight off spam and oddly seems to\nhave fewer spammers going around from server to server with the hopes of\ndeceiving users or just ruin their experience. We’ve also heard very positive\nand unanimous feedback from the people from other communities we’ve talked to\nthat have made “the move” from Telegram to Discord as well: moving over to\nDiscord has significantly reduced spam and increased community engagement and\nparticipation rates.\n\nBetter Ways to Keep Up-To-Date\nAnother neat benefit the community will gain from being united under the same\nplatform is the ability to quickly stay up-to-date with the project and get\nadditional information and content. Because it is very easy to add and find (as\na user) new channels, we’ll be capitalizing on that to keep you all in the loop.\n\nDon’t have Twitter? Can’t be bothered looking around for updates? Forgot to put\nParticl’s next event in your calendar? Well, it doesn’t matter anymore, because\nwe’ve got your back!\n\nIn fact, we’ve already created a few channels specifically dedicated to making\nyour life easier. To be more precise, we’ve created a whole section dedicated to\nmaking project information and updates as accessible as it’s ever been! This\nsection contains these sub-channels:\n\n * #announcements: Get all the latest news about Particl. This is usually what\n   goes on particl.news.\n * #progress-updates: This sub-channel contains all the development updates and\n   general information about the progress being made on the project. This is\n   where you’ll find Status Reports, notable Github updates, development\n   updates, and etc.\n * #tweets: This section automatically shows all the tweets made from the\n   official @ParticlProject Twitter account. It doesn’t matter if you have a\n   Twitter account or not, you should still be able to easily get access to our\n   tweets if you so desire!\n * #team: Here you will get the chance to learn a bit more about the Particl\n   team members by reading various bios and information tidbits about them.\n * #graphics: There’s a lot of Particl-related graphics, but somehow they’ve\n   always been hard to get a hold of. Not anymore! This sub-channel contains all\n   the latest important graphics. If you are looking for a specific graphic in\n   particular, well then you now know where to-3.24% go look for it!\n * #events: This is like your very own Particl calendar. This sub-channel will\n   remind you of any Particl-related event 30, 7, and 1 day before they happen.\n   This includes conferences, community gatherings, hardforks, release dates,\n   and etc. Never miss an event anymore!\n * #youtube: This one is self-explanatory. Just like #tweets, this sub-channel\n   will automatically post the latest videos published on Particl’s Youtube\n   account.\n\nAs time goes by, and as we receive feedback and suggestions, new sub-channels\nwill be added to make the Particl Discord server the ultimate platform to be on\nto not miss anything.\n\nGot Some Spare Change?\nWe will shortly introduce on Discord an open-source tipping bot that will allow\nyou to securely send PART tips to other people directly from Discord. This\nshould make newcomers warmer and more engaged to our community and encourage\npeople who receive tips to pay it forward, strengthening the bond between us\nall!\n\nAutomation Make Everything Easier and More Fun\nAutomation and bots on Discord are the bomb! They are much more flexible than on\nTelegram, opening up more opportunities. They allow polls, custom commands,\nauto-moderation, music streaming, tags, auto-responders, and much more. This\nwill allow for many more interactions and much more fun and will help make\nParticl’s Discord our very own world.\n\nWhile we had bots on Telegram and Discord before, we couldn’t really use them to\ntheir full extent as they lose their effectiveness when users are spread across\nvarious different platforms. They obviously cannot interact with users on other\nplatforms, so we couldn’t make use of their more exciting, fun, and engaging\ncapabilities. This is poised to change now!\n\nA Better Structure for Community Involvement\nWe’re also currently working on setting up a better structure for the onboarding\nof community members who want to take a more active role in contributing to the\nproject. As can be easily observed, staying organized when only using a chat\nplatform can be quite difficult if you do not use any sort of task management\nplatform.\n\nUsing automation, we are in the process of linking a Trello board to a\ncontributor’s channel to make it easy and accessible to manage tasks. Once\nready, contributors will be able to interact with the Trello board directly from\nthe channel and collaborate with fellow community members up for the task. This\ncontributor channel should be ready in a couple of days and will be an\ninvite-only channel, so don’t hesitate to contact @CryptoGuard#3505 on Discord\nso that he can add you to the channel!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat Will Become of Rutherford?\nRutherford BotRutherford is the bot that’s been linking all of Particl’s chat\nplatforms together. To incentivize people to move over to Discord, we will\ndeactivate it on Telegram and put the platform in a read-only mode in just 7\ndays, meaning you will be able to read what people say on Discord, but won’t be\nable to post messages.\n\nWhat About Riot?\nRiot is a different beast and will get a different treatment with this move to\nDiscord, at least in the beginning. It doesn’t attract spammers, is relatively\nsecure by allowing end-to-end encryption, and is where most of our developers\nhang around. For these reasons, we will keep Riot and Discord connected for the\nmoment and will see how it plays out. Due to the low number of community members\non Riot, this shouldn’t impact the user experience too much. Still, we recommend\nusers looking for a more interactive experience to move over to Discord.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOfficially moving to Discord has been something we’ve been looking into doing\nfor quite some time now, and with the marketplace looming and the potential\nuptick in new users it may bring, it only seems logical to make this move now.\nWe are extremely excited by the new possibilities having our entire community\ngathered within the same platform opens up, and we fully intend on making the\nbest out of this situation to enhance your community experience.\n\nSo come to join us today on Discord [https://discord.me/particl] and let the fun\nbegin!\n\nThe Particl team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-is-Officially-Moving-to-Discord/1-rjpXh09SzFLlD51LJyr-4Q.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"better-community-support-more-fun\">Better Community Support &amp; More Fun</h3><p>The Particl community has been spread across many different platforms ever since we abandoned Slack more than a year ago.

Then there’s the issue of always being required to maintain the Rutherford bot which tends to break from time to time.</p><p>On top of this, and perhaps more importantly, there’s the inconvenience where we can’t really make the chatrooms as awesome as they could be by using bots since everyone’s on different platforms; bots sometimes don’t communicate or simply cannot interact, by nature, with users on different platforms.</p><p>For these and other reasons, we’ve made the decision to officially move over to Discord and methodically reduce resources on Riot and Telegram slowly over time. <strong>In 7 days, starting from today, the Telegram channels will be put in read-only mode</strong>. This should incentivize the remaining Telegram users to move over while still allowing new Telegram users to discover the project and read the conversations.</p><p><a href=\"https://discord.me/particl\"><strong>Particl - Discord Me</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://discord.me/particl\"><em>Official server for the Particl project.

With the release of the Open Marketplace being imminent, we anticipate an uptick in new users joining our awesome community. Serving new users on one platform instead of many will make everyone’s user experience much better and will allow us to do much more. Here’s a quick list of what the move to Discord will look like and — more importantly — what opportunities it opens up. Note that this list is obviously not complete, and new stuff will be added as we march forward.</p><h3 id=\"better-user-experience\">Better User Experience</h3><p>This is probably the most obvious benefit we’ll get from moving exclusively to one platform. Interacting on many different platforms at the same time definitely reduces the user experience by making much less appealing and, frankly, more confusing — especially to newcomers coming into our community and not being used to see bots responding instead of real people.</p><p>Let’s face it, linking platforms has many downsides. Bot conversations are confusing chains of replies to users on different platforms, images struggle uploading properly everywhere at the same time. The various different Particl channels, each with their unique URL and mixed between other crypto channels on Telegram is also pretty chaotic.</p><p>Discord will fix all of the above by providing a clean and structured interface that will go a long way in enhancing the quality of interactions and make everything more fun and intuitive.</p><h3 id=\"fight-off-spammers\">Fight Off Spammers</h3><p>Spam on Telegram is off the rails!</p><p>Every day, we see fake accounts joining the many channels and spamming them with seriously questionable content or “business proposals”. And it’s not like we don’t fight back. Even though our Telegram channels have three different bots specifically dedicated to filtering these kinds of unwanted posts, spam still happens at a pretty regular rate.</p><p>Discord simply offers more tools and ways to fight off spam and oddly seems to have fewer spammers going around from server to server with the hopes of deceiving users or just ruin their experience. We’ve also heard very positive and unanimous feedback from the people from other communities we’ve talked to that have made “the move” from Telegram to Discord as well: moving over to Discord has significantly reduced spam and increased community engagement and participation rates.</p><h3 id=\"better-ways-to-keep-up-to-date\">Better Ways to Keep Up-To-Date</h3><p>Another neat benefit the community will gain from being united under the same platform is the ability to quickly stay up-to-date with the project and get additional information and content. Because it is very easy to add and find (as a user) new channels, we’ll be capitalizing on that to keep you all in the loop.</p><p>Don’t have Twitter? Can’t be bothered looking around for updates? Forgot to put Particl’s next event in your calendar? Well, it doesn’t matter anymore, because we’ve got your back!</p><p>In fact, we’ve already created a few channels specifically dedicated to making your life easier. To be more precise, we’ve created a whole section dedicated to making project information and updates as accessible as it’s ever been! This section contains these sub-channels:</p><ul><li><strong>#announcements:</strong> Get all the latest news about Particl. This is usually what goes on particl.news.</li><li><strong>#progress-updates:</strong> This sub-channel contains all the development updates and general information about the progress being made on the project. This is where you’ll find Status Reports, notable Github updates, development updates, and etc.</li><li><strong>#tweets:</strong> This section automatically shows all the tweets made from the official @ParticlProject Twitter account. It doesn’t matter if you have a Twitter account or not, you should still be able to easily get access to our tweets if you so desire!</li><li><strong>#team:</strong> Here you will get the chance to learn a bit more about the Particl team members by reading various bios and information tidbits about them.</li><li><strong>#graphics: </strong>There’s a lot of Particl-related graphics, but somehow they’ve always been hard to get a hold of.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
