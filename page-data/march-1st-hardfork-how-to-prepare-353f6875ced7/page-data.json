This hardfork will port two testnet features onto mainnet: multi-signature\ncold staking and paid SMSG. Because hardforks are a pretty big deal, it is\nimportant for you to prepare your nodes in prevision of this event so that you\nare not left staking on a deprecated chain. Luckily, the whole preparation\nprocess is extremely easy.\n\nDevelopment Update - Planned Hardfork Schedule - Particl News\n[https://particl.news/development-update-planned-hardfork-schedule-5051238feac0]\n2019.02.16-12:00:00 UTC In 4 days, on the 16th of February, we're going to fork\nParticl's test network (testnet) to…\n[https://particl.news/development-update-planned-hardfork-schedule-5051238feac0]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/development-update-planned-hardfork-schedule-5051238feac0]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to Prepare\nThe only thing you need to make sure is that the nodes you are running are\nupdated to Particl Core 0.17.1.3, or, at the very least, Particl Core 0.17.1.2. \nAny version prior to this one will not be compatible with the hardforked chain\nand will therefore make you stake on the wrong chain. This will make all of your\nstaking rewards invalid and any transaction made on that wrong chain will not be\nreflected on the hardforked chain. In other words, you absolutely need to update\nyour node before the hardfork if you wish to use PART post-hardfork.\n\nHere’s how to do it, depending on the client you use.\n\nParticl Desktop | Particl Qt/cli | Partyman | Cold Staking Pool | Particl Copay \n| On Exchange\n\nI. Particl Desktop\nIf you’re using Particl Desktop, then lucky you, because it is the easiest of\nall clients to update. Running Particl Desktop 1.2.x and beyond means your\nwallet will automatically notify you as soon as there’s a new Particl Core\nversion available. All you have to do after getting this notification is close\nyour Particl Desktop wallet and reopen it. Your Particl Core daemon should\nautomatically update upon reopening the client.\n\nAs a precautionary measure, even if you are running Particl Desktop 1.2.x and\nbeyond, it is recommended to manually check if the wallet has properly updated.\nThere shouldn’t be any issue, but you can never be too careful when a hardforks\ncoming.\n\n.Additionally, if you are running a Particl Desktop version older than 1.3.1,\nthen we highly recommend, as always, upgrading to the latest version\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-3-1-released-8802e7b326fb] as it fixes\nvarious issues, bugs, and contains many improvements.\n\nDownload Particl Desktop 1.3.1: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.3.1\n\nParticl Desktop 1.3.1 Announcement & Changelog: \nhttps://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-3-1-released-8802e7b326fb\n\nparticl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.3.1]\nParticl Angular GUI - The source for the Particl GUI. - particl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.3.1]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.3.1]\n\nII. Particl-Qt & Particl-cli\nIf you’re running either Particl-Qt or Particl-cli, then you will need to\nmanually download and install the latest version of Particl Core. Simply visit\nthe Particl-Core Github release page\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/] and download the latest\nversion.\n\nNote: The latest Particl Core version is 0.17.1.3, not 0.17.1.2. However, as\nlong as you run a Particl Core version that is equal or more recent than\n0.17.1.2, you will have no issue with the hardfork. Particl Core 0.17.1.2 is the\nMINIMUM version required for your to follow along with the network’s hardfork.\n\nDownload Particl Core 0.17.1.3: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.3\n\nparticl/particl-core\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.3]\nParticl Core integration/staging tree.

Partyman (Cold Staking App)\nIf you are using Partyman to cold stake your funds, then whenever you enter a\ncommand within the app, it should automatically prompt you to install the newest\nversion. In order to properly update your node, you will first need to upgrade\nyour Partyman app, then update your Core. In order to do this, follow the steps\nbelow:\n\n * Go into your Partyman folder (cd /root/partyman)\n * Type the command git pull. This will update the Partyman app.\n * Once done, update Particl Core by typing./partyman update\n * Accept the update by typing y\n * Once updated, restart your Particl Core by typing./partyman restart\n * Accept the restart by typing y\n\nIV. Cold Staking Pool\nIf you are cold staking from a pool, you don’t need to do anything other than\nupdate whatever wallet you use to access your funds. Usually, this would be\nParticl-Qt or Particl Desktop. Refer to the instructions above to properly\nupdate.\n\nIf you are a pool operator, you will need to update both the Particl Core and\nthe packages of your pool. Follow these steps:\n\n * First update your pool’s packages: \n   https://github.com/particl/coldstakepool/blob/master/doc/upgrade_old_install_to_package.txt\n * Then, update your Particl Core: \n   https://github.com/particl/coldstakepool/blob/master/doc/upgrade_daemon.txt\n\nV. Particl Copay Wallet\nIf you are using Particl’s mobile application, Particl Copay, then you don’t\nneed to do anything. The nodes Particl Copay connects to will automatically\nupdate in time for the hardfork.\n\nVI. Coins on Exchange\nIf your coins are stored on an exchange, then you don’t need to do anything. The\nexchange will update its nodes in time for the hardfork. Exchanges and other\nthird-parties running Particl nodes have already been made aware of the upcoming\nhardfork.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBy following these instructions, you should be equipped to navigate any standard\nissue during or after the hardfork. If you have any question, don’t hesitate to \njoin our Discord [https://discord.gg/YFeXbFZ] server and ask your questions in\nthe #support channel. We’ll be happy to help you out!\n\nIn the meantime, we can’t wait to go through this hardfork and add to Particl’s\nnetwork these two awesome features!\n\nThe Particl Team","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/March-1st-Hardfork---How-to-Prepare/1-kh3WLAKAS__ioHCNfdYKxg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>As many of you know, the <a href=\"https://particl.news/development-update-planned-hardfork-schedule-5051238feac0\"><strong>PART mainnet network is going to undergo a hardfork on the 1st of March 2019</strong></a>.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
