Now that Particl’s free, unrestricted, and private\nmarketplace has arrived, it’s time to make some noise know about it!\n\nWith the renewal of funding for the team, we have begun to gradually ramp up\nmarketing, promotional, and strategical efforts to turn Particl Marketplace into\na busy place.\n\nNew Website About to Go Live\nAs part of these efforts, we're launching, next week, the first version of\nParticl’s new website. This new website is expected to grow and evolve in the\nweeks to come and aims at better communicating Particl’s vision of a free,\nunrestricted, and private e-commerce environment with no middleman, along with\nall the benefits it unlocks.\n\nNew Roadmap\nThe team has established a new roadmap for technical development, marketing, and\nbusiness development. It’s been designed with a set of precise goals and\nobjectives in mind, which we’ll be revealing in a separate Particl News blog\npost this coming Thursday, the 7th of October, 2021. We’ve mentioned it a few\ntimes already, but we can’t wait to reveal the items it contains; we’re\nconvinced you’re going to like where we’re going, and it’s certain to take\nParticl to the next level.\n\nBasicSwap Atomic Swap DEX\nAs occasionally mentioned in some of our development progress reports, we’ve\nbeen making very good progress on the next big thing coming for Particl:\nBasicSwap.\n\nBasicSwap is a private and autonomous cross-chain DEX built using atomic swaps\nand Particl’s very own SecureMessaging (SMSG) protocol. More simply, it means\nthat it’s a decentralized swap exchange that lets you swap coins from one chain\nto another without the intervention of any middleman like an exchange, payment\nprocessor, or any other kind of third-party. All swaps happen between two people\nand are inherently private and autonomous.\n\nBasicSwap, standalone client (WIP)While the DEX is currently in closed beta (but\nalready running on mainnet), we plan to open it up to the public shortly. So\nkeep your eyes fixated on Particl News as we soon begin to publish more\ninformation about it.\n\nMuch More to Come\nThe points mentioned above are sure exciting, but it’s far from the only things\nbeing cooked up at the moment. You can expect more promotional efforts,\ninitiatives, and surprises to come in the weeks and months to come. While we\ndon’t want to repeat ourselves too much, the fun is getting started, and the\nbest is yet to come!\n\nYou are the Pioneer!\nThere’s never been a better time to get active and introduce others to the\nworld's most revolutionary marketplace. We need all the buyers and seller we can\nget! So let’s all discuss it with friends and families, in your communities, and\non the web, in places you feel would benefit the most from a fair, unrestricted,\nand private e-commerce environment with no middleman. We are ALL what makes\nParticl happen!\n\nAnd don’t forget! To make it easier, the Particl Academy\n[https://academy.particl.io/] is there to help you out when introducing Particl\nto others. With its help on your side, you can now turn anybody into a Particl\npro and quickly get them started.\n\nFinally, we highly encourage you to support our current pioneering vendors by\nbuying items from them or referring others to Particl Marketplace.

It’s been designed with a set of precise goals and objectives in mind, which we’ll be revealing in a separate Particl News blog post <strong>this coming Thursday, the 7th of October, 2021</strong>. We’ve mentioned it a few times already, but we can’t wait to reveal the items it contains; we’re convinced you’re going to like where we’re going, and it’s certain to take Particl to the next level.</p><h2 id=\"basicswap-atomic-swap-dex\">BasicSwap Atomic Swap DEX</h2><p>As occasionally mentioned in some of our development progress reports, we’ve been making very good progress on the next big thing coming for Particl: BasicSwap.</p><p>BasicSwap is a private and autonomous cross-chain DEX built using atomic swaps and Particl’s very own SecureMessaging (SMSG) protocol. More simply, it means that it’s a decentralized swap exchange that lets you swap coins from one chain to another without the intervention of any middleman like an exchange, payment processor, or any other kind of third-party. All swaps happen between two people and are inherently private and autonomous.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2021/09/Particl_Basicswap_Standalone.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2021/09/Particl_Basicswap_Standalone.jpg 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2021/09/Particl_Basicswap_Standalone.jpg 1000w, /glink/2021/09/Particl_Basicswap_Standalone.jpg 1435w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>BasicSwap, standalone client (WIP)</figcaption></figure><p>While the DEX is currently in closed beta (but already running on mainnet), we plan to open it up to the public shortly.

You can expect more promotional efforts, initiatives, and surprises to come in the weeks and months to come.

This would make\nboth of them much easier to use, more flexible, secure, private, and, perhaps\nmore importantly, set the stage for getting adoption from a broader range of\naudiences. This major and long-awaited upgrade is what is now known as “Particl\nV3”. \n\nWe are excited to announce, today, that Particl V3 is going live, on mainnet, on\nthe 29th of September 2021 at 12:00 UTC! \n\nThanks to all of you in the community for your support, time, passion,\nexperience, and dedication in helping out, testing, and engaging in constructive\nconversations that help shape the future of e-commerce and personal liberties.\nYou are what makes Particl's mission possible; our hats are off to you!\n\nNow let's go over a few basic information you need to know in preparation for\nthe mainnet release of Particl V3.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhere will it be available?\nParticl V3 refers to the new Particl Desktop (3.0.0) client which gives access\nto the new Particl Marketplace and community governance module. And so, to use\nthe marketplace, you will need to install the latest version of Particl Desktop,\nwhich will be available on the official Particl website\n[https://particl.io/downloads] and the project’s Github page\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/] on the 29th of September\n2021 at 12:00 UTC.\n\nWhat can I do to prepare?\nFinalize open orders on previous versions of the marketplace\nParticl V3 is the biggest update to Particl ever since the project was launched\nin 2017. And because the scope of the changes is so large, orders and listings\ncreated on previous versions won't be compatible with Particl V3.\n\nFor this reason, we highly recommend finalizing any open marketplace order on\nprevious versions. But don’t worry, if you have open orders that you cannot\ncomplete at this moment (i.e., the escrow smart-contract is still locked),\nyou’ll be able to switch between Particl Desktop 2.x.x and Particl 3.x.x freely,\nat any time, to finalize orders even if you’ve started using Particl V3.\n\nSpread the good word around you\nWith the long-anticipated Particl V3 release now having an official mainnet\nrelease date, now’s the time to inform people around you and talk about all the\nbenefits that private and unrestricted e-commerce without middlemen offers.\n\nTo support your communication efforts after the release, you'll be able to point\npotential newcomers to the Particl Academy.\n\nThe Particl Academy is Coming!\nTo support the mainnet release of Particl V3, the Particl Academy will launch on\nthe same day (29th of September 2021 at 12:00 UTC).\n\nThe Particl Academy is your guide to becoming an expert in distributed\ne-commerce with Particl Marketplace. It gives you all the information you need\nto master Particl V3 and the other components of the Particl ecosystem. It’s a\nthorough reference book written in simple and straightforward language that\nanybody can understand.\n\nIf you show Particl to someone new, don’t forget to point them to the Particl\nAcademy! That'll let them quickly learn about it and guide them through their\nfirst steps.\n\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nIf you haven’t already done so, we'd like to invite you to subscribe to our\nnewsletter so that you don’t miss any important news, update, or exclusive\ncontent. \n\nAlong with the Particl V3 mainnet release, we are re-initiating our newsletter\ncommunication. We will be pushing news, stories, and other valuable content\nthrough it from now on and subscribing is a perfect way not to miss anything\nimportant.\n\n * Subscribe to Particl's newsletter here: https://bit.ly/3CgyB3q\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSee You on Mainnet!\nParticl V3 is the new, more modern foundation on top of which the future of\nParticl is being built; it's just the beginning! \n\nWe also want to remind you to stay tuned as we will release a new,\ngroundbreaking roadmap shortly after the mainnet release of Particl V3. We are\nconvinced that you will be as excited as we are about the path forward. The next\nfew milestones are all about increasing Particl’s accessibility, usability,\nscalability, and, of course, adoption.\n\nOnce again, thank you for your incredible support and confidence throughout the\nentire development cycle of Particl V3. Positive words, constructive feedback,\nand discussions are critical to the success of the Particl ecosystem. We are\nblessed to have you as such a dedicated and passionate community and we're very\nexcited to walk through this journey with you all!\n\nLet’s now make sure to spread the word about the upcoming release to get as many\neyes as possible on it, and let’s blast through the next phase of the project.\nThe best is yet to come and it starts on the 29th of this month!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

Notably interesting\nis the new addition of the governance module on testnet, we encourage you to\ncheck it out!\n\nIf you encounter any problem while testing this new version of Particl V3 or\nhave feedback to give, please add a \"new issue\" on Github (click here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues/new/choose]). Make sure to\nexplain in detail the problem you’ve encountered, how to reproduce it, and the\nOS you’re using.

It gives you additional information about what's happening in the\nbackground.\n\nWindows\n 1. Open \"Windows Explorer\"\n 2. On the installation folder (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\Particl Desktop\n    Testnet\\Particl Desktop Testnet\") Press [SHIFT⇧]+[MOUSE-RIGHT◳] and choose\n    \"Open command window here\"\n 3. Type the following command including the quotation marks into the terminal\n    and hit [ENTER ↵] \"Particl Desktop Testnet.exe\"\n\nMac\n 1. Open \"Terminal\" \n    (e.g. [COMMAND ⌘] + [SPACE] and type terminal > hit [ENTER ↵])\n 2. Type in this command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    /Applications/Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet.app/Contents/MacOS/Particl\\ Desktop\\\n    Testnet\n\nLinux\n 1. Open a terminal in the folder where you’ve installed the application and\n    type the following command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    ./Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet\n\nChangelog\nWhat follows is a list of changes, bug fixes, and improvements made to Particl\nV3 since the last testnet release. This list is not exhaustive, it does not\ninclude some of the smaller and/or less impactful fixes.\n\nGovernance Module\n * Enable the governance module for testing.\n * Fixed an issue where graphs were not displaying in release builds.\n\nMarket Module\n * Publishing fee estimates now correctly include the image fees.\n * Filtering for expired listings in Sell > Listings page now works correctly.\n * A warning is now displayed when there may be insufficient utxos (but\n   sufficient total funds) to publish a listing AND all its images. The ability\n   to still continue with the publish is possible, but requires the seller to\n   explicitly indicate that this is acceptable.\n * Updated the csv product import functionality to attempt to match on country\n   name (English only for now) instead of just the ISO code.\n * The csv product import now allows for specifying the \"shipping to\"\n   destinations countries in a comma separated list.\n * The market summary text of a market shown in the Joined Markets section is\n   now selectable.\n * Includes changes made to particl-marketplace service such as...\n * Fixed an error that prevented a bid from being placed if all the images of\n   the item in question had not been properly received.\n * Fixed an error that caused the buyflow to become stuck due to the buyer\n   cancelling the purchase arrangement but the seller completing the escrow\n   state prior to receiving the cancellation action.\n * The particl-marketplace service now has some time on termination to attempt\n   to gracefully shut itself down, instead of terminating processing immediately\n   (and potentially causing issues with the processing of messages).\n * Remove the lookup for an existing \"market\" named wallet to create the initial\n   profile/identity wallets from when initializing the service for the first\n   time: this potentially causes errors and requires manual user intervention if\n   the named \"market\" wallet is encrypted and locked during the service\n   initialization.\n\nWallet Module\n * Updated the zap functionality (cold staking) to cater to additional user\n   options.\n * Changed wording on the transaction table entries to make more sense when fees\n   are involved: this includes fees paid for smsg fees (eg: publishing listings\n   via smsg) and zap transaction fees.\n * The restore wallet flow now caters to 12 word mnemonic inputs.\n\nGeneral\n * Added additional messages to message of the day.\n * Spelling and other grammar updates.\n * Update and unify usage of the zmq library dependency.\n * Application crashes should now be handled correctly: instead of receiving a\n   nasty JS error prompt, the error is logged and a friendlier window is\n   displayed indicating that the application has crashed. This is a temporary\n   stopgap change that leads into better logging and user visibility into what\n   the application is doing.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you for your support and assistance in testing this new version of Particl\nV3.

It gives you additional information about what's happening in the\nbackground.\n\nWindows\n 1. Open \"Windows Explorer\"\n 2. On the installation folder (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\Particl Desktop\n    Testnet\\Particl Desktop Testnet\") Press [SHIFT⇧]+[MOUSE-RIGHT◳] and choose\n    \"Open command window here\"\n 3. Type the following command including the quotation marks into the terminal\n    and hit [ENTER ↵] \"Particl Desktop Testnet.exe\"\n\nMac\n 1. Open \"Terminal\" \n    (e.g. [COMMAND ⌘] + [SPACE] and type terminal > hit [ENTER ↵])\n 2. Type in this command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    /Applications/Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet.app/Contents/MacOS/Particl\\ Desktop\\\n    Testnet\n\nLinux\n 1. Open a terminal in the folder where you’ve installed the application and\n    type the following command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    ./Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet\n\nChangelog\nWhat follows is a list of changes, bug fixes, and improvements made to Particl\nV3 since its first testnet release. This list is not exhaustive, it does not\ninclude some of the smaller and/or less impactful fixes.\n\n[Governance module] Introduces a new governance module that allows for viewing\nactive and upcoming CCS proposals that require a network vote, as well as past\nproposals. Voting on a current or future proposal is currently available,\nalthough not enabled when using a cold staking wallet (the vote should rather be\ncast on the cold staking node). Further, detailed information on the proposals\nand how to vote is included in the module. While the governance module is\nincluded in this release, it has been temporarily disabled - this is not a bug\n\n[Market module] Removes the unused and invalid publishing controls in the\nproduct import wizard.\n\n[Market module] Images are displayed alongside the market name, if available, in\nadditional places in the product creation and publishing areas.\n\n[Market module] Removes the display of a 'ROOT' parent category that was\ndisplayed on items in the cart.\n\n[Market module] Replaces usage of the word 'bid' with 'order request' and\n'order' where appropriate, to avoid confusion ('bid' terminology is confusing,\nwith 'order request' more accurately aligning with the behaviour).\n\n[Market module] Fixes an error in the GUI preventing the joining of a market\nunder certain circumstances.\n\n[Market module] When a listing item is flagged, all exact duplicates of the\nlisting item in the same market are now flagged as well. When a new duplicate of\nan already flagged item is received for the same market, it will be flagged as\nwell.\n\n[Market module] Fixes a case in the Listing Details where action buttons were\nnot disabling correctly when another action is being processed and taking some\ntime to complete.\n\n[Market module] Adds the ability to export to CSV a list of sell orders. The\nsell orders exported are those currently displayed; sell orders exported are\ninfluenced by any search and filtering criteria applied).\n\n[Market module] Fixes an issue preventing publishing items to a market with a 0\nvalue for either of the shipping prices.\n\n[Market module] Fixes an error whereby the wrong favorite item may be removed\nwhile attempting to remove a favorite item.\n\n[Market module] Reduces the number of stealth addresses used per wallet/identity\nthroughout the marketplace.\n\n[Market module] Adds additional validation to market message order sequencing.\n\n[Wallet module] Prevents the user from navigating to another app/module in\ncertain steps of the wallet creation: this prevents issues with potentially\nusing an uninitialized wallet in other app/module (i.e., the Governance module).\n\n[General] Fixes the zmq.node error on some versions of Windows that prevented\nthe application from opening.\n\n[General] Attempts a fix at a possible intermittent issue where the connection\nevent may not be properly processed and thus the application fails to start\ncorrectly. Further testing and feedback may be necessary.\n\n[General] Display a random \"message of the day\" on the welcome screen. The\ncurrent number of messages is limited, but can be added to in the future.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf this testing round goes well and no other major issue is identified in the\nnext couple of days, Particl V3 will be ready for mainnet very shortly. We will\nclearly communicate the mainnet release date on Particl News\n[https://particl.news/] and within the usual communications channels.\n\nSo let's get testing and keep an eye out for the confirmation on the release\ndate very soon!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This marks yet another significant milestone for the project as this\nfunds the team to develop, promote, and expand the Particl ecosystem once more.\n\nLet’s break down the numbers and go through the implications of this funding\nproposal moving forward.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Results Are In!\nTeam Funding Request\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/team-funding-request-1.html]The Team Funding\nRequest #1 suggested attributing funds from the Treasury Fund to the Particl\nteam to support the development, promotion, and expansion of the Particl\necosystem. The proposal requested 35,250 PART per month from the treasury for 6\nmonths, after which a new funding request will need to be pushed by the team and\napproved by stakeholders.\n\nWe are happy to report that Particl stakeholders have approved this proposal \nwith a solid 98.6% approval rate (minimum required was 60%) and a 64%\nparticipation rate (minimum required was 20%). The vote lasted for 5,040 blocks,\nwith 3,191 of them voting in favor of the proposal and 46 voting against it.\n\nWhen Will the Team Start Claiming Funds\nWith the funding request now approved, the team can now claim funds from the\ntreasury according to its stated schedule. However, because the new treasury\nmodel has just gone live today (read the Hardfork Successful\n[https://particl.news/july-2021-hardfork-successful/] blog post for more\ndetails), which is in the middle of July, the team will only start claiming\nfunds at the end of August. That means that the first month out of the six\nrequested by the team’s funding request will be August. The proposal then\nexpires after the month of January 2022, which is the last month out of the six\nwhere the Particl team will claim funds. A new funding request will then be\npublished and will need to be approved by Particl stakeholders.\n\nIn the meantime, the team will use the remaining days of July to finalize the\ndeployment of the new legal entity, finish up the new website, and get\neverything ready for August and onward. Within that period, the team will also\nprepare the new roadmap for public release and explain, in detail, the reasoning\nbehind it and the objectives that motivate it. Spoiler alert, it is simply\namazing, and we can’t wait to share it with you all!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank You For Your Trust\nThis particular proposal was the first-ever funding request for the new treasury\nmodel. Because the community entirely owns the treasury’s fund, this proposal\nasked for much more than just coins to support the project; it asked for the\ncommunity’s trust and stamp of approval.\n\nWith this in mind, we want to thank every one of you in the community for this\nvote of confidence and for participating in this democratic exercise. We are all\nvery excited to move past the mainnet release of Particl V3 and get down to some\nserious business!\n\nLet’s take Particl to the literal next level and deliver to the world a truly\ndecentralized, private, secure, and free e-commerce platform that is easy to\nuse. It’s high time that we all break free from the chains of greedy\ncorporations and agenda-driven organizations that have centralized control and\npower both on the internet and offline.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This is a very important milestone for Particl as the\nhardfork introduces various changes and re-enables the ability to conduct blind\nand anon transactions.\n\nThis blog post will summarize everything brought by the hardfork and provide an\nupdate on the claims submitted by users who had coins temporarily disabled.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Has Hardforked\nToday, on Monday the 12th of July, 2021, at 17:00 UTC, the Particl blockchain\nhas successfully hardforked. This event officially turns the page on the\nunfortunate exploit on the chain that led to the creation of fraudulent coins\nout of thin air.\n\nFor an overview of the exploit and its disclosure, please head over to this\nParticl News blog post [https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/].\nFor a summary of the solutions that have been deployed, please check out this\none [https://particl.news/roadmap-to-post-inflation-hardfork/].\n\n> Note: If your Particl Core node is not updated to Particl Core 0.19.2.12, then\nit means you are now staking on the wrong chain. Any staking reward earned on\nthe wrong chain won't count on the correct chain, and you won't be able to send\nor receive payments from other people. Updating to Particl Core 0.19.2.12 is\nmandatory.\nBlind and Anon Transactions Re-Enabled\nOne of the two main components of this hardfork is the re-enabling of blind and\nanon transactions. In addition, the hardfork also re-enables the majority of\nanon and blind balances that were temporarily disabled to stop the attacker from\ncausing further damage on the blockchain.\n\nIn other words, you can now freely make blind and anon transactions once again\nand use Particl Marketplace on Particl Desktop V2. The hardfork also enables\nParticl V3 to go live on mainnnet as it relies on blind and anon transactions.\nMore details on this very soon!\n\nRe-Enable Coins Using the Low Pass Filter\nIf you had coins on blind and/or anon balances when the vulnerability was\nannounced and fixed, then they have been temporarily disabled up until today. To\nre-enable them, the Particl team deployed a “low pass filter” which\nautomatically re-enables any output with 200 or fewer coins.\n\nTo re-enable temporarily disabled coins using the low pass filter, you will need\nto enter the following command, once for every disabled output, in your Particl\nclient’s debug window.\n\ndebugwallet {\\\"spend_frozen_output\\\":true}\n\nFor example, if you have 220 disabled coins separated into two 110 PART outputs,\nyou will need to enter the above command twice in a row. You need to use Particl\nCore 0.19.2.12 to successfully re-enable your coins.\n\nRe-Enable Coins Using the Manual Claim Process\nIf you have disabled blind and anon outputs that contain more than 200 coins,\nyou were required to manually submit a claim to the team to include it in the\nwhitelist. If that’s your case, and you’ve submitted a claim, then your outputs\nhave been whitelisted, and you can now spend them. To do just that, you will\nneed to follow the same step as with the low pass filter.\n\nFor every disabled output you have, you need to type in the following command.\n\ndebugwallet {\\\"spend_frozen_output\\\":true}\n\nFor example, if you have 1,000 coins that are currently disabled, spread into 4\noutputs of 250 PART each, you will need to type the above command 4 times. You\nneed to use Particl Core 0.19.2.12 to successfully re-enable your coins.\n\nManual Claim Process Update\nTo be as transparent as possible, we’d like to provide a full update on the\nmanual claim process and its impact on Particl’s circulating supply.\n\nThroughout the entire span of the claim process, a total of 12 claims have been\nsubmitted to the team. Each claim has been thoroughly inspected and audited. We\nare happy to say that all submitted claims appear legitimate and that none of\nthem traced back to fraudulent or suspicious outputs. The submitted claims\neither traced back to their public origin, were accompanied by a proof of\npurchase, or had the typical cryptography one would expect from legitimate\noutputs.\n\nFor this reason, all claims been approved by both the team and the community\ngroup of validators. This claim process results in an additional\n810,588.43967605 PART being added to the supply, bringing it to a current total\nof ~11,411,000 PART. This doesn’t take any coin re-enabled through the low pass\nfilter into account.\n\n> Note: Particl’s block explorer [https://explorer.particl.io/status] currently\ndisplays a smaller circulating supply value than what is stated above. That’s\nbecause it doesn’t see disabled coins from users who haven’t yet executed the\ncommand to re-enable them. Every time users manually re-enable their coins, the\nblock explorer will dynamically adjust its circulating supply value.\nNew Treasury Model is Live\nThe second principal component of this hardfork is the activation of Particl’s\nnew and decentralized treasury model, which provides the ecosystem with\nperpetual PART revenue. Check out this blog post\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/] for more details.\n\nDecentralized Treasury Model ProposalLearn more about the new CCS proposal to\nform a new decentralized treasury model to support the Particl ecosystem.Blog\ncryptoguard [https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/]As a\nresult of this successful hardfork, anyone can now submit funding requests on\nParticl’s CCS platform to fund and support initiatives that directly benefit the\necosystem. Any funding request has to be approved by Particl stakeholders\nthrough an on-chain vote for the funds to be allocated from the treasury.\n\nIf you want to submit a proposal, please head over to the CCS platform\n[https://ccs.particl.io/] and read the instructions provided on there.\n\nIncrease in Staking Rewards\nAs part of the new treasury model, staking rewards are also getting a bump.\nIndeed, as of today, Particl’s emission rate has increased from 2% per year to\n8%, with half of the rewards going directly into the Treasury Fund.\n\nThat means that, as an individual staker, your staking rewards double from 2%\nper year to a minimum of 4%. But, of course, the actual yield rewarded to you\nfrom staking PART varies depending on how many more PART coins are being staked\nby other people. If, for example, only 50% of all PART coins stake on the\nnetwork, then you can expect your annual returns to be closer to 8% than 4%. You\ncan use CryptoID’s useful extraction tool\n[https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/#!extraction] to track the percentage of all\nPART coins being staked by their owner.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Particl team would like to thank you all for your incredible support and\nunderstanding through this challenging series of events. As we officially turn\nthe page on the vulnerability exploit with the hardfork, the team is excited to\nmove forward once again and spend its time growing and promoting the Particl\necosystem.\n\nStay tuned as we near the mainnet release of Particl V3 and soon release a bunch\nof exciting news, including the new roadmap, on Particl News.\n\nWhat doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, and that’s precisely the case here.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

Particl Core 0.19.2.12\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.12], which is now\nreleased in full, is the client that activates the hardfork. Exchanges have been\ncontacted, and have agreed to go ahead with the hardfork as planned.\n\nThis marks an important milestone for Particl as it turns the page on the\ninflationary bug discovered earlier this year and deploys the new decentralized\ntreasury model to fund and support the Particl ecosystem.\n\n> Note 1: It is mandatory that you update your Particl Core node to 0.19.2.12\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.12] if you haven’t\nalready done so. Failure to do this in time for the hardfork will lead you to\nconnect to the wrong chain. As a result, any payment sent to other people will\nnot be relayed, and you won’t be able to use anon/blind balances or Particl\nMarketplace.\n> Note 2: If you are casting your vote for the proposal currently going through\nits voting period (the first team funding request\n[https://particl.news/team-funding-proposal-vote-scheduled/]), then that means\nthat you are already using Particl Core 0.19.2.12\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.12]. If that's the\ncase, there is nothing more for you to do, you're already all set!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s this Hardfork About?\nThis coming hardfork, scheduled for the 12th of July, 2021 at 17:00 UTC and\nactivated by Particl Core 0.19.2.12, has two primary purposes.\n\nRe-Enabling Temporarily Disabled Anon and Blind Balances\nParticl Vulnerability DisclosureLearn everything about Particl’s recent\nvulnerability discovery and emergency hardfork.Blogcryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/]The Particl team\nnoticed, in February 2021, a discrepancy between the expected and the observed\nsupply. Indeed, it was found that there were more coins in circulation than\nthere should.\n\nThe team immediately investigated the situation and discovered that an attacker\nhad exploited the chain. This allowed a hacker to create a certain number of\ncoins out of thin air to sell them on the trading markets. The bug that made\nthis possible was located and fixed in an emergency hardfork, leading to anon\nand blind balances being temporarily disabled.\n\nThe hardfork re-enables legitimate anon and blind balances while keeping\nexploited ones disabled.\n\nDecentralized Treasury Model Activation\nDecentralized Treasury Model ProposalLearn more about the new CCS proposal to\nform a new decentralized treasury model to support the Particl ecosystem.Blog\ncryptoguard [https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/]\nAdditionally, the Particl community recently approved a new treasury model to\nprovide the ecosystem with a decentralized and perpetual source of PART income.\nThis allows anyone to create and publish proposals on the CCS platform and get\ntheir initiative(s) funded if approved by the community through an on-chain\nvote.\n\nThe hardfork activates this new treasury model live on mainnet.\n\nWhat Do I Need To Do?\nTo successfully follow through the hardfork and land on the proper chain, all\nyou need to do is update your Particl Core node to 0.19.2.12.\n\nRelease Particl Core 0.19.2.12 · particl/particl-coreRelease\nNotes:https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019212Hashes8381f9a3f00c4515c32f87d9a66cc04ce3de2ad1aad95171e7c4cd99d91b46dc\nparticl-0.19.2.12-aarch...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.12] * Download\n   link: https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.12\n\nThis version is already live, as a full release, and you can download it\ndirectly on Github here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.12]. If you are\ncold staking using Particl’s cold staking application Partyman, simply enter\nthis command to update your node: cd ~/partyman && ./partyman update.\n\nOnce you’ve updated your node, you don’t need to do anything else. You’ll\nhardfork on the 12th of July, at 17:00 UTC, with the rest of the network. The\nhardfork is an entirely automatic process as long as you’re running the correct\ncore version.\n\nAnything Else Included in the Hardfork?\nThe two main items of this hardfork have been detailed in the first section of\nthis blog post, after the introduction. However, a few other minor items are\nincluded, which are available in the release notes of Particl Core 0.19.2.12.\nYou can simply follow this link\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019212] \nto get the full list of additions included in this release.\n\nMaking Particl V3’s Mainnet Release Possible\nAn important but indirect result of this hardfork is that it will make the\nmainnet release of Particl V3 possible. Indeed, Particl V3 cannot be released on\nmainnet up until the hardfork.\n\nThat’s because Particl Marketplace, which is hosted on the V3 desktop client,\nuses both anon and blind balances for various functions, including enabling\nescrow contracts and paying for listing fees. And because both anon and blind\nbalances are currently disabled, it is simply impossible to use the marketplace.\n\nAs the hardfork goes live, Particl Marketplace will, once again, be usable and\nthus able to be released on mainnet.\n\nAs an estimate, you can expect Particl V3 to go live on mainnet, roughly one\nweek after the hardfork. This short period between the hardfork and the V3\nrelease ensures optimal post-fork stability and that the launch goes on as\nsmoothly as possible.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe entire Particl team is immensely grateful to all of you in the community and\nwants to extend our thanks for your support and patience as we worked through\nthis unfortunate situation. With this event rapidly coming to an end, we are\nincredibly excited to turn the page and focus entirely on what will make the\nParticl ecosystem grow and get more adopted.\n\nFollowing the release of Particl V3 on mainnet, you can expect a brand new\npost-V3 roadmap to be released. It provides a strategic plan to grow the\necosystem and, equally as important, raise its level of adoption.\n\nWe cannot wait to share it with you all and bring the benefits of decentralized\ne-commerce to a broader-than-ever audience!

It requests\n35,250 PART per month from the treasury fund for a period of 6 months only\nafter\nwhich the team will submit a new funding...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/9]Over the past few weeks, the Particl team has proposed an out-of-the-box\nstrategy to fund the development and expansion of the Particl ecosystem and the\nteam’s operations [https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/].\n\nThe strategy consists of a new decentralized treasury model that gets\nautomatically funded by the protocol using a portion of the network’s staking\nrewards. Anyone with a project or initiative that benefits Particl can then\nsubmit proposals (referred to as funding requests) to request funds from the\ntreasury and get them approved by stakeholders through an on-chain vote. This\nprovides the Particl ecosystem with an adequate PART income source intended to\nsupport and enhance the Particl project.\n\nFor a project, idea, or initiative to be funded from the Treasury Fund, it needs\nto be first published on the CCS platform as a proposal, and then, go through an\non-chain voting round. That’s why, today, the Particl team is officially pushing\nits funding request. We are seeking the approval of stakeholders to claim funds\nthat will go into the development and promotion of the ecosystem and its related\noperations for a duration of 6 months.\n\nParticl Team’s Funding Request\n * Funding request: 35,250 PART (monthly)\n * Duration: 6 months\n\nThis funding request suggests bootstrapping the Particl team by claiming 35,250\nPART, monthly, from the Treasury Fund for a duration of 6 months. Once this\nperiod expires, the proposal will no longer be valid. The team will then need to\npublish a new, updated funding request and get it approved by Particl\nstakeholders to claim funds again.\n\nAdditionally, to protect itself from price volatility and ensure uninterrupted\noperations, the team is opting to claim funds based on a price of 1 PART = $1.\nAlthough this leads to an initial larger claim, it does, on the flip side, bring\nmore financial stability and security to the project.\n\nAny unused PART will be safely deposited into the team’s reserve fund to provide\nfunding for unforeseen expenses or increase individual cost-related activities.\n\nFunding Distribution Breakdown\nThe funds requested by the Particl team are intended to serve multiple different\npurposes other than just funding development. Here is how the funds are intended\nto be split.\n\n * Development (60%), to fund the development of the Particl ecosystem and\n   expand the current development team. Resources will also be allocated to work\n   on various items other than Particl Core, Desktop, and Marketplace. This\n   includes, but isn't limited to, Particl Copay, the SMSG network (SMSG 2.0),\n   BasicSwap (atomic swap DEX), web and mobile platforms, and so on).\n * Marketing and community (20%), to increase Particl’s brand awareness and\n   exposure within the cryptocurrency, blockchain, e-commerce, and other related\n   industries. Also includes onboarding new community members, expanding on\n   welcoming efforts on current platforms, as well as expanding social media\n   communities.\n * Management, legal, and administration (8%), to fund any administrative or\n   corporate costs (i.e., human resources, accounting, project management, legal\n   costs, corporate fees, etc.).\n * Business development (12%), to pursue strategic opportunities, develop\n   partnerships/relationships, and identify/capitalize on new markets for\n   Particl's line of products. This also includes the advisory and exchange\n   listing budgets.\n\nThe Team's Vision Moving Forward\nIn the past, the Particl team has had to constantly deal with a limited amount\nof capital and, for this reason, has had to almost exclusively focus on\ndevelopment. This has given birth to groundbreaking products such as the Particl\nMarketplace, the Particl Desktop client, the PART privacy coin, cold staking,\nand the up and coming Particl V3 and BasicSwap DEX releases.\n\nOther areas, such as marketing, user adoption, business development, and\ncommunity growth, have been underfunded and lacking. Allocating resources to\nthese areas has been an overwhelming request from the community, and that’s\nprecisely what the team intends on doing with the funds it’s requesting.\n\nMore Focus on Promoting Particl’s Awesome Products and Growth\nParticl has consistently been recognized for the quality and uniqueness of its\nblockchain products, but it has been limited in its capacity to promote them the\nway they deserve. That’s all about to change!\n\nAs part of the team’s strategy moving forward, a portion of the funding claimed\nfrom the Treasury Fund will be allocated to various promotions and initiatives\naimed at increasing Particl’s exposure and growing the ecosystem. This will\nestablish a vital balance between development, marketing, and growth.\n\nAdditionally, a new and completely redone Particl.io website is being built and\nis scheduled to be released once Particl V3 has gone live on mainnet.\n\nSupporting and Expanding the Team\nFor the last few weeks, the Particl team has gone through a heavy internal\nrestructuring process in preparation for the introduction of the decentralized\ntreasury. As we carefully reflected on the last few years of this journey, we\nhave identified several areas and processes that must be improved and have\nworked on making these changes to be ready for action as soon as the funding\nallows it.\n\nThis restructuring has led to a major change in the team’s leadership,\ncommunications (internal and external), and roles. This led to clear strategic\nobjectives and a defined vision for Particl’s growth.\n\nAt the time of this writing, we can confirm the following Particl team members\nto be taking part, full or part time, in this new Particl journey phase.\n\n * Cryptoguard — Project management and communications\n * Gerlof van Ek (crz) — Project and development management, Lead Designer,\n   UI/UX, and front-end developer\n * Imran — Treasury and business management, strategic partnerships\n * Henk Swardt — Development management and coordinator\n * Tecnovert — Lead core developer\n * Arnold Bansemer — Lead desktop developer\n * Kewde — Marketplace developer, OMP, and core\n * Juha Kovanen — Marketplace developer\n * Martin — UI & UX integration and front-end developer\n * Dros — Marketing, branding, and business research & development\n * Dasource — Technical research & development\n\nNote: More (or new) team members may soon join the ranks. This list represents\nthe current situation at the time of writing this blog post.\n\nTeam Expansion\nFunding the aforementioned core Particl team members is just the beginning. A\ngreater focus will be on expanding and growing the team by hiring new talents or\ncontracting work with partners.\n\nThe expansion process is planned for later in the year and will be strategically\ndeployed at the opportune time to expand at the right pace and without friction.\n\nAdditionally, you may see the team add, over time, various advisors to its\nadvisory board to provide valuable inputs, connections, exposure, and advice.\n\nEncouraging and Stimulating Third-Party Contributions\nAlthough the team is requesting capital from the treasury to fund its\noperations, we strongly reiterate that Particl is moving towards community-led\ngovernance. The team strongly wants to see the Particl ecosystem increase its\nlevel of decentralization in all aspects, and encouraging community-led\ninitiatives is one of the best ways to achieve this.\n\nTo that end, the team is committed to building and delivering tools,\ndocumentation, guidance, and support to the community in pushing forward new\nideas and projects.\n\nBudgets and Expenses\nInfrastructure Expenses\n“Expenses” refers to any payment, recurring or not, that has to be made to\nassure the well-functioning of the project. These include, but are not limited\nto, platform and service subscriptions, legal and corporate fees, domain\nregistrations, server maintenance, etc. \n\nAt the current moment, these expenses are being assumed by team members in a\npersonal capacity. The funds being requested as part of this proposal are\nintended to cover all project expenses and take that financial burden off\nindividual team members.\n\nBudgets\n\n“Budgets” refers to PART deposit addresses, each with a specific purpose, that\nthe team will set aside to support various initiatives that benefit the Particl\necosystem. Budgets are funded using claimed funds from the treasury and do not\ninclude team member salaries. Here is the detailed breakdown of these budgets.\n\nMarketing Funds (Recurring on a monthly)\n\n * Content Creation, to bring more regular content to Particl News, Youtube,\n   social media channels, and other mediums.\n * Digital Ads, to increase Particl’s exposure in key online locations (i.e.,\n   Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, etc.) through the deployment of targeted ads.\n * Vendor Onboarding and Outreach Program, to grow the number of active vendors\n   on the Particl Marketplace and ease the platform’s adoption.\n\nMarketing Funds (Event-based)\n\n * Giveaways, Airdrops, Contests, and Rewards, to help grow the project with new\n   members/users and keep things interesting within the community.\n * Influencer and Sponsorship Marketing, to increase Particl’s exposure by\n   leveraging influencer marketing (and their communities).\n * Media and Promotional Content/Campaigns, to increase Particl’s exposure in\n   blockchain and technology-related media.\n * Events and Conferences Attendance/Sponsorships (incl. virtual), to increase\n   Particl’s exposure in related events and form new, valuable relationships.\n\nExchange Listings and Partnerships Fund\n\n * Exchange listings fees and similar related costs, to get Particl listed on\n   quality exchanges and other third-party services.\n * Partnership and team collaboration funds, to ease the establishment of\n   partnerships and collaborative projects with other teams.\n\nLegal Fund\n\n * Legal costs, to pay for any required legal services.\n * Corporate fees, to pay for any corporate or administrative fees.\n\nEach month, these budgets will receive a percentage of the funds claimed by the\nParticl team from the treasury model.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that not all the funds reserved for a specific\nbudget will necessarily be spent within that same month. In other words, if, for\nexample, a particular budget receives 1,000 PART a month, it doesn’t mean that\nprecisely 1,000 PART will be used throughout the month. Any unused funds will\nremain in the PART deposit address, growing the available funds for that\nspecific budget to be used later on, as needed.\n\nAlthough these are currently entertained budgets, they are subject to change as\nwe progress and dynamically adapt strategies. The funding attribution (the\nnumber of PART each of these budgets receive every month) will be constantly\nreviewed and adjusted based on results and intended strategies moving forward.\nNew budgets may also be added, while others may be retracted. The Particl team\nwants to retain a good level of flexibility to adapt rapidly to any situation\nand to the ever-evolving blockchain industry.\n\nThe Reserve Fund\nAny extra fund collected from the treasury, which hasn’t been spent on salaries,\nexpenses, or budgets, will be deposited into the team’s Reserve Fund. This\nincludes potential donations from private individuals and other similar sources\nof income for the team.\n\nThis Reserve Fund serves as a flexible buffer to safeguard the project against\nsudden price drops and emergency/miscellaneous expenditures. Over time, it is\nexpected to grow in size and value, providing the project with an ever-growing\nsafety cushion that will provide much-needed flexibility.\n\nA New Legal Entity to Support the Project\nTo support and represent the project, as well as to manage funds and deal with\nany legal matter, a new legal entity will be formed in the crypto-friendly\njurisdiction of the Cayman Islands. This new entity has several benefits over\nthe previous legal setup of the Particl Foundation, which is located in Zug,\nSwitzerland.\n\n * A more flexible legal entity operating within a well-respected and\n   pro-blockchain jurisdiction.\n * Clear and progressive legal guidance for blockchain and cryptocurrency\n   projects.\n * More financially efficient structure with a much lower “burn rate” (smaller\n   monthly costs) and corporate maintenance costs.\n\nThis new legal entity will serve several functions for the Particl project, such\nas acting as the main point of contact for third parties (i.e., exchanges),\nholding custody and managing any funds claimed by the team from the treasury,\nemitting contracts and enter into agreements with partners, execute payments\n(i.e., salaries, expenses), own assets (i.e., Copay servers), publish releases\n(i.e., Particl Copay), and so on.\n\nThe Particl team has, at the time of this writing, already entered into a signed\nagreement with a new legal advisor and has begun preparing the groundwork to set\nup the new entity as soon as the proposal is approved. This ensures the new\nlegal entity will be ready very soon after the voting period for this proposal\nends so that the project can move forward swiftly.\n\nNote: The legal entity will be a formal representative of the team. It is not\nresponsible nor necessary for the operation of the Particl project and network.\n\nLet’s Summarize\nThere’s a lot going on in this blog post, so let’s recap a bit. Here’s what this\nproposal gets you.\n\n * Strategic restructuring of the team leading to clearer communications, more\n   defined roles. It also secures the commitment of those involved and brings\n   overall quality improvement in all business areas.\n * Support from a flexible and impeccably regulated legal entity which will\n   significantly reduce administrative burdens and costs.\n * Expansion and funding in all critical areas, including development,\n   marketing, legal, business, etc.\n * New engaging, easy-to-understand, and compelling website for Particl focusing\n   on the products and their benefits.\n * Dedicated campaigns and actions to crowd the Particl Marketplace with vendors\n   and customers.\n * Commitment to grow the user base and community.\n * Financial resources for getting listed on more prominent exchanges,\n   third-party platforms, and the development of strategic partnerships.\n\nWith the upcoming major releases of Particl V3 and the atomic swap DEX, the\nParticl project will have highly marketable and working products that will make\nit stand out above the crowd. This will open the door to a new era for the\nParticl project from all angles. You will find key efforts in the domain of\nmarketing, roll-out, and vitalization of Particl’s products.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo read the official proposal, visit its page on the CCS platform by following \nthis link [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/9]. \n\nThe proposal is currently in its discussion phase for a minimum of one week, so\nplease leave a reply directly on its CCS page if you have any feedback or\ncomment.

Anyone with a project or initiative that benefits Particl can then submit proposals (referred to as funding requests) to request funds from the treasury and get them approved by stakeholders through an on-chain vote. This provides the Particl ecosystem with an adequate PART income source intended to support and enhance the Particl project.</p><p>For a project, idea, or initiative to be funded from the Treasury Fund, it needs to be first published on the CCS platform as a proposal, and then, go through an on-chain voting round. That’s why, today, the Particl team is officially pushing its funding request. We are seeking the approval of stakeholders to claim funds that will go into the development and promotion of the ecosystem and its related operations for a duration of 6 months.</p><h2 id=\"particl-team-s-funding-request\">Particl Team’s Funding Request</h2><ul><li><strong>Funding request:</strong> 35,250 PART (monthly)</li><li><strong>Duration:</strong> 6 months</li></ul><p>This funding request suggests bootstrapping the Particl team by claiming 35,250 PART, monthly, from the Treasury Fund for a duration of 6 months. Once this period expires, the proposal will no longer be valid. The team will then need to publish a new, updated funding request and get it approved by Particl stakeholders to claim funds again.</p><p>Additionally, to protect itself from price volatility and ensure uninterrupted operations, the team is opting to claim funds based on a price of 1 PART = $1. Although this leads to an initial larger claim, it does, on the flip side, bring more financial stability and security to the project.</p><p>Any unused PART will be safely deposited into the team’s reserve fund to provide funding for unforeseen expenses or increase individual cost-related activities.</p><h3 id=\"funding-distribution-breakdown\">Funding Distribution Breakdown</h3><p>The funds requested by the Particl team are intended to serve multiple different purposes other than just funding development. Here is how the funds are intended to be split.</p><ul><li><strong>Development (60%)</strong>, to fund the development of the Particl ecosystem and expand the current development team. Resources will also be allocated to work on various items other than Particl Core, Desktop, and Marketplace. This includes, but isn't limited to, Particl Copay, the SMSG network (SMSG 2.0), BasicSwap (atomic swap DEX), web and mobile platforms, and so on).</li><li><strong>Marketing and community (20%)</strong>, to increase Particl’s brand awareness and exposure within the cryptocurrency, blockchain, e-commerce, and other related industries. Also includes onboarding new community members, expanding on welcoming efforts on current platforms, as well as expanding social media communities.</li><li><strong>Management, legal, and administration (8%)</strong>, to fund any administrative or corporate costs (i.e., human resources, accounting, project management, legal costs, corporate fees, etc.).</li><li><strong>Business development (12%)</strong>, to pursue strategic opportunities, develop partnerships/relationships, and identify/capitalize on new markets for Particl's line of products. This also includes the advisory and exchange listing budgets.</li></ul><h2 id=\"the-team-s-vision-moving-forward\">The Team's Vision Moving Forward</h2><p>In the past, the Particl team has had to constantly deal with a limited amount of capital and, for this reason, has had to almost exclusively focus on development. This has given birth to groundbreaking products such as the Particl Marketplace, the Particl Desktop client, the PART privacy coin, cold staking, and the up and coming Particl V3 and BasicSwap DEX releases.</p><p>Other areas, such as marketing, user adoption, business development, and community growth, have been underfunded and lacking. Allocating resources to these areas has been an overwhelming request from the community, and that’s precisely what the team intends on doing with the funds it’s requesting.</p><h3 id=\"more-focus-on-promoting-particl-s-awesome-products-and-growth\">More Focus on Promoting Particl’s Awesome Products and Growth</h3><p>Particl has consistently been recognized for the quality and uniqueness of its blockchain products, but it has been limited in its capacity to promote them the way they deserve. That’s all about to change!</p><p>As part of the team’s strategy moving forward, a portion of the funding claimed from the Treasury Fund will be allocated to various promotions and initiatives aimed at increasing Particl’s exposure and growing the ecosystem. This will establish a vital balance between development, marketing, and growth.</p><p>Additionally, a new and completely redone Particl.io website is being built and is scheduled to be released once Particl V3 has gone live on mainnet.</p><h2 id=\"supporting-and-expanding-the-team\">Supporting and Expanding the Team</h2><p>For the last few weeks, the Particl team has gone through a heavy internal restructuring process in preparation for the introduction of the decentralized treasury. As we carefully reflected on the last few years of this journey, we have identified several areas and processes that must be improved and have worked on making these changes to be ready for action as soon as the funding allows it.</p><p>This restructuring has led to a major change in the team’s leadership, communications (internal and external), and roles. This led to clear strategic objectives and a defined vision for Particl’s growth.</p><p>At the time of this writing, we can confirm the following Particl team members to be taking part, full or part time, in this new Particl journey phase.</p><ul><li><strong>Cryptoguard </strong>— Project management and communications</li><li><strong>Gerlof van Ek (crz) </strong>— Project and development management, Lead Designer, UI/UX, and front-end developer</li><li><strong>Imran </strong>— Treasury and business management, strategic partnerships</li><li><strong>Henk Swardt</strong> — Development management and coordinator</li><li><strong>Tecnovert </strong>— Lead core developer</li><li><strong>Arnold Bansemer </strong>— Lead desktop developer</li><li><strong>Kewde </strong>— Marketplace developer, OMP, and core</li><li><strong>Juha Kovanen </strong>— Marketplace developer</li><li><strong>Martin </strong>— UI &amp; UX integration and front-end developer</li><li><strong>Dros</strong> — Marketing, branding, and business research &amp; development</li><li><strong>Dasource</strong> — Technical research &amp; development</li></ul><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> More (or new) team members may soon join the ranks.

Anyone with a project or initiative that benefits Particl can then submit proposals (referred to as funding requests) to request funds from the treasury and get them approved by stakeholders through an on-chain vote. This provides the Particl ecosystem with an adequate PART income source intended to support and enhance the Particl project.</p><p>For a project, idea, or initiative to be funded from the Treasury Fund, it needs to be first published on the CCS platform as a proposal, and then, go through an on-chain voting round. That’s why, today, the Particl team is officially pushing its funding request. We are seeking the approval of stakeholders to claim funds that will go into the development and promotion of the ecosystem and its related operations for a duration of 6 months.</p><h2 id=\"particl-team-s-funding-request\">Particl Team’s Funding Request</h2><ul><li><strong>Funding request:</strong> 35,250 PART (monthly)</li><li><strong>Duration:</strong> 6 months</li></ul><p>This funding request suggests bootstrapping the Particl team by claiming 35,250 PART, monthly, from the Treasury Fund for a duration of 6 months. Once this period expires, the proposal will no longer be valid. The team will then need to publish a new, updated funding request and get it approved by Particl stakeholders to claim funds again.</p><p>Additionally, to protect itself from price volatility and ensure uninterrupted operations, the team is opting to claim funds based on a price of 1 PART = $1. Although this leads to an initial larger claim, it does, on the flip side, bring more financial stability and security to the project.</p><p>Any unused PART will be safely deposited into the team’s reserve fund to provide funding for unforeseen expenses or increase individual cost-related activities.</p><h3 id=\"funding-distribution-breakdown\">Funding Distribution Breakdown</h3><p>The funds requested by the Particl team are intended to serve multiple different purposes other than just funding development. Here is how the funds are intended to be split.</p><ul><li><strong>Development (60%)</strong>, to fund the development of the Particl ecosystem and expand the current development team. Resources will also be allocated to work on various items other than Particl Core, Desktop, and Marketplace. This includes, but isn't limited to, Particl Copay, the SMSG network (SMSG 2.0), BasicSwap (atomic swap DEX), web and mobile platforms, and so on).</li><li><strong>Marketing and community (20%)</strong>, to increase Particl’s brand awareness and exposure within the cryptocurrency, blockchain, e-commerce, and other related industries. Also includes onboarding new community members, expanding on welcoming efforts on current platforms, as well as expanding social media communities.</li><li><strong>Management, legal, and administration (8%)</strong>, to fund any administrative or corporate costs (i.e., human resources, accounting, project management, legal costs, corporate fees, etc.).</li><li><strong>Business development (12%)</strong>, to pursue strategic opportunities, develop partnerships/relationships, and identify/capitalize on new markets for Particl's line of products. This also includes the advisory and exchange listing budgets.</li></ul><h2 id=\"the-team-s-vision-moving-forward\">The Team's Vision Moving Forward</h2><p>In the past, the Particl team has had to constantly deal with a limited amount of capital and, for this reason, has had to almost exclusively focus on development. This has given birth to groundbreaking products such as the Particl Marketplace, the Particl Desktop client, the PART privacy coin, cold staking, and the up and coming Particl V3 and BasicSwap DEX releases.</p><p>Other areas, such as marketing, user adoption, business development, and community growth, have been underfunded and lacking. Allocating resources to these areas has been an overwhelming request from the community, and that’s precisely what the team intends on doing with the funds it’s requesting.</p><h3 id=\"more-focus-on-promoting-particl-s-awesome-products-and-growth\">More Focus on Promoting Particl’s Awesome Products and Growth</h3><p>Particl has consistently been recognized for the quality and uniqueness of its blockchain products, but it has been limited in its capacity to promote them the way they deserve. That’s all about to change!</p><p>As part of the team’s strategy moving forward, a portion of the funding claimed from the Treasury Fund will be allocated to various promotions and initiatives aimed at increasing Particl’s exposure and growing the ecosystem. This will establish a vital balance between development, marketing, and growth.</p><p>Additionally, a new and completely redone Particl.io website is being built and is scheduled to be released once Particl V3 has gone live on mainnet.</p><h2 id=\"supporting-and-expanding-the-team\">Supporting and Expanding the Team</h2><p>For the last few weeks, the Particl team has gone through a heavy internal restructuring process in preparation for the introduction of the decentralized treasury. As we carefully reflected on the last few years of this journey, we have identified several areas and processes that must be improved and have worked on making these changes to be ready for action as soon as the funding allows it.</p><p>This restructuring has led to a major change in the team’s leadership, communications (internal and external), and roles. This led to clear strategic objectives and a defined vision for Particl’s growth.</p><p>At the time of this writing, we can confirm the following Particl team members to be taking part, full or part time, in this new Particl journey phase.</p><ul><li><strong>Cryptoguard </strong>— Project management and communications</li><li><strong>Gerlof van Ek (crz) </strong>— Project and development management, Lead Designer, UI/UX, and front-end developer</li><li><strong>Imran </strong>— Treasury and business management, strategic partnerships</li><li><strong>Henk Swardt</strong> — Development management and coordinator</li><li><strong>Tecnovert </strong>— Lead core developer</li><li><strong>Arnold Bansemer </strong>— Lead desktop developer</li><li><strong>Kewde </strong>— Marketplace developer, OMP, and core</li><li><strong>Juha Kovanen </strong>— Marketplace developer</li><li><strong>Martin </strong>— UI &#x26; UX integration and front-end developer</li><li><strong>Dros</strong> — Marketing, branding, and business research &#x26; development</li><li><strong>Dasource</strong> — Technical research &#x26; development</li></ul><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> More (or new) team members may soon join the ranks. This list represents the current situation at the time of writing this blog post.</em></p><h3 id=\"team-expansion\">Team Expansion</h3><p>Funding the aforementioned core Particl team members is just the beginning. A greater focus will be on expanding and growing the team by hiring new talents or contracting work with partners.</p><p>The expansion process is planned for later in the year and will be strategically deployed at the opportune time to expand at the right pace and without friction.</p><p>Additionally, you may see the team add, over time, various advisors to its advisory board to provide valuable inputs, connections, exposure, and advice.</p><h3 id=\"encouraging-and-stimulating-third-party-contributions\">Encouraging and Stimulating Third-Party Contributions</h3><p>Although the team is requesting capital from the treasury to fund its operations, we strongly reiterate that Particl is moving towards community-led governance. The team strongly wants to see the Particl ecosystem increase its level of decentralization in all aspects, and encouraging community-led initiatives is one of the best ways to achieve this.</p><p>To that end, the team is committed to building and delivering tools, documentation, guidance, and support to the community in pushing forward new ideas and projects.</p><h2 id=\"budgets-and-expenses\">Budgets and Expenses</h2><h3 id=\"infrastructure-expenses\"><strong>Infrastructure Expenses</strong></h3><p>“Expenses” refers to any payment, recurring or not, that has to be made to assure the well-functioning of the project. These include, but are not limited to, platform and service subscriptions, legal and corporate fees, domain registrations, server maintenance, etc. </p><p>At the current moment, these expenses are being assumed by team members in a personal capacity. The funds being requested as part of this proposal are intended to cover all project expenses and take that financial burden off individual team members.</p><p><strong>Budgets</strong></p><p>“Budgets” refers to PART deposit addresses, each with a specific purpose, that the team will set aside to support various initiatives that benefit the Particl ecosystem. Budgets are funded using claimed funds from the treasury and do not include team member salaries. Here is the detailed breakdown of these budgets.</p><p><strong>Marketing Funds (Recurring on a monthly)</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Content Creation</strong>, to bring more regular content to Particl News, Youtube, social media channels, and other mediums.</li><li><strong>Digital Ads</strong>, to increase Particl’s exposure in key online locations (i.e., Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, etc.) through the deployment of targeted ads.</li><li><strong>Vendor Onboarding and Outreach Program</strong>, to grow the number of active vendors on the Particl Marketplace and ease the platform’s adoption.</li></ul><p><strong>Marketing Funds (Event-based)</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Giveaways, Airdrops, Contests, and Rewards</strong>, to help grow the project with new members/users and keep things interesting within the community.</li><li><strong>Influencer and Sponsorship Marketing, </strong>to increase Particl’s exposure by leveraging influencer marketing (and their communities).</li><li><strong>Media and Promotional Content/Campaigns</strong>, to increase Particl’s exposure in blockchain and technology-related media.</li><li><strong>Events and Conferences Attendance/Sponsorships (incl. virtual), </strong>to increase Particl’s exposure in related events and form new, valuable relationships.</li></ul><p><strong>Exchange Listings and Partnerships Fund</strong></p><ul><li><strong><strong><strong>Exchange listings fees and similar related costs, </strong></strong></strong>to get Particl listed on quality exchanges and other third-party services.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Partnership and team collaboration funds, </strong></strong></strong>to ease the establishment of partnerships and collaborative projects with other teams.</li></ul><p><strong>Legal Fund</strong></p><ul><li><strong><strong><strong>Legal </strong></strong>costs<strong><strong>,</strong></strong></strong> to pay for any required legal services.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Corporate fees,</strong></strong></strong> to pay for any corporate or administrative fees.</li></ul><p>Each month, these budgets will receive a percentage of the funds claimed by the Particl team from the treasury model.</p><p>However, it’s important to note that not all the funds reserved for a specific budget will necessarily be spent within that same month. In other words, if, for example, a particular budget receives 1,000 PART a month, it doesn’t mean that precisely 1,000 PART will be used throughout the month. Any unused funds will remain in the PART deposit address, growing the available funds for that specific budget to be used later on, as needed.</p><p>Although these are currently entertained budgets, they are subject to change as we progress and dynamically adapt strategies. The funding attribution (the number of PART each of these budgets receive every month) will be constantly reviewed and adjusted based on results and intended strategies moving forward. New budgets may also be added, while others may be retracted. The Particl team wants to retain a good level of flexibility to adapt rapidly to any situation and to the ever-evolving blockchain industry.</p><h3 id=\"the-reserve-fund\"><strong>The Reserve Fund</strong></h3><p>Any extra fund collected from the treasury, which hasn’t been spent on salaries, expenses, or budgets, will be deposited into the team’s Reserve Fund. This includes potential donations from private individuals and other similar sources of income for the team.</p><p>This Reserve Fund serves as a flexible buffer to safeguard the project against sudden price drops and emergency/miscellaneous expenditures. Over time, it is expected to grow in size and value, providing the project with an ever-growing safety cushion that will provide much-needed flexibility.</p><h2 id=\"a-new-legal-entity-to-support-the-project\">A New Legal Entity to Support the Project</h2><p>To support and represent the project, as well as to manage funds and deal with any legal matter, a new legal entity will be formed in the crypto-friendly jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands. This new entity has several benefits over the previous legal setup of the Particl Foundation, which is located in Zug, Switzerland.</p><ul><li>A <strong>more flexible</strong> legal entity operating within a well-respected and pro-blockchain jurisdiction.</li><li><strong>Clear and progressive legal guidance</strong> for blockchain and cryptocurrency projects.</li><li><strong>More financially efficient structure </strong>with a much lower “burn rate” (smaller monthly costs) and corporate maintenance costs.</li></ul><p>This new legal entity will serve several functions for the Particl project, such as acting as the main point of contact for third parties (i.e., exchanges), holding custody and managing any funds claimed by the team from the treasury, emitting contracts and enter into agreements with partners, execute payments (i.e., salaries, expenses), own assets (i.e., Copay servers), publish releases (i.e., Particl Copay), and so on.</p><p>The Particl team has, at the time of this writing, already entered into a signed agreement with a new legal advisor and has begun preparing the groundwork to set up the new entity as soon as the proposal is approved. This ensures the new legal entity will be ready very soon after the voting period for this proposal ends so that the project can move forward swiftly.</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> The legal entity will be a formal representative of the team. It is not responsible nor necessary for the operation of the Particl project and network.</em></p><h1 id=\"let-s-summarize\"><strong>Let’s Summarize</strong></h1><p>There’s a lot going on in this blog post, so let’s recap a bit. Here’s what this proposal gets you.</p><ul><li>Strategic restructuring of the team leading to clearer communications, more defined roles. It also secures the commitment of those involved and brings overall quality improvement in all business areas.</li><li>Support from a flexible and impeccably regulated legal entity which will significantly reduce administrative burdens and costs.</li><li>Expansion and funding in all critical areas, including development, marketing, legal, business, etc.</li><li>New engaging, easy-to-understand, and compelling website for Particl focusing on the products and their benefits.</li><li>Dedicated campaigns and actions to crowd the Particl Marketplace with vendors and customers.</li><li>Commitment to grow the user base and community.</li><li>Financial resources for getting listed on more prominent exchanges, third-party platforms, and the development of strategic partnerships.</li></ul><p>With the upcoming major releases of Particl V3 and the atomic swap DEX, the Particl project will have highly marketable and working products that will make it stand out above the crowd. This will open the door to a new era for the Particl project from all angles. You will find key efforts in the domain of marketing, roll-out, and vitalization of Particl’s products.</p><hr><p>To read the official proposal, visit its page on the CCS platform by following <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/9\">this link</a></strong>. </p><p>The proposal is currently in its discussion phase for a minimum of one week, so please leave a reply directly on its CCS page if you have any feedback or comment. As always, the schedule for this proposal’s voting period will be clearly announced a few days before it starts on all the usual Particl channels.</p><p>We hope that you are as excited as we are about this proposal. It has the potential to significantly change things around by giving you, as a stakeholder of Particl, tremendous value. Let it be the trigger that lights the spark for the Particl ecosystem, giving it the needed exposure, recognition, resources, and workforce that it deserves.</p><p>Be a part and cast your vote on this pivotal proposal!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

This marks a significant moment in Particl history as the end\nresult is a new, more powerful self-funding mechanism for the ecosystem.\n\nLet’s break down the numbers in more detail and go through the timeline for the\ncoming weeks as the new decentralized treasury makes its way on mainnet.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Results Are In!\nThe Decentralized Treasury Proposal vote, the first-ever “protocol consensus\nchanging vote”, was an important milestone for Particl because it proposed\napplying critical changes to the protocol. Indeed, the proposal suggested\nraising the yearly PART coin emission rate from 2% to 8%, with half of the\nstaking rewards being automatically deposited into a treasury fund by the\nprotocol.\n\nWe are happy to report that the proposal was approved by Particl stakeholders,\nscoring a mind-blowing 96.6% approval rate (minimum required was 75%) and a \n70.6% participation rate (minimum required was 20%). The vote lasted for 10,080\nblocks, with 6,884 of them voting in favor of the proposal and 239 voting\nagainst it.\n\nThe participation rate for this voting round increased by ~7% compared to the\nprevious (and first) proposal that required a vote. This is an incredibly\nencouraging news in light of Particl’s transition into a community governed\nproject and shows just how active its stakeholders are.\n\nWhen Will it Go Live?\nNow that the results are official and that the decentralized treasury model has\nbeen approved, it can now be deployed on the Particl blockchain. For this to\nhappen requires a hardfork which relies on two deliverables.\n\nThe first one is, obviously, the integration of the decentralized treasury code\ninto the blockchain. The code for the changes has been completed and the build\nis now going through a thorough testing process on a side network (Particl clone\nnetwork).\n\nThe second deliverable is the integration of the output whitelist into the\nblockchain. This is tied to the output claim process which is currently ongoing.\nAs a reminder, the pre-fork process ends on June 21st, 2021. If you want your\ntemporarily disabled anon and blind outputs to be re-enabled in the coming\nhardfork, make sure you’ve read read this blog post\n[https://particl.news/output-claim-process-is-live/] and submit your claim\nbefore that date, if needed.\n\nOnce the cutoff date of the claim period is reached, the final pre-fork output\nwhitelist will be bundled with the next Particl Core release and be submitted to\nexchanges so they can start the process of preparing for the coming hardfork. \n\nIf all goes well, Particl should be forking on the 12th of July, 2021. This is\ncurrently a target, the actual hardfork may happen a bit before or after,\ndepending on how fast exchanges and partners get ready for the fork. As always,\nwe will keep you updated with any news on the regard.\n\nThe Team Funding Proposal Goes Live Early This Week\nPutting in place a decentralized treasury model was only a first step in funding\nback the current Particl team. The second step is another proposal that will\nrequest capital from the treasury fund to fund the team and its operations. This\nproposal isn’t unlike what anyone else in the community can bring forward, but\nit’ll be Particl’s first-ever proposal to request resources from the treasury\nfund.\n\nThe proposal will detail the team’s strategy moving forward and will explain how\nit intends on utilizing the funds it is claiming. The proposal will be published\nand begin its discussion phase in the early moments of the week, on the CCS\nplatform. Make sure to be around if you want to provide comments and feedback on\nthe team proposal!\n\nNow’s the Best Time to Get Involved\nNow that the decentralized treasury model is about to go live on mainnet, you\ncan prepare your proposals and get them ready to be published. If, in the past,\nyou’ve had projects or ideas for Particl but couldn’t get the required capital\nto start them up, you now possess all you need to overcome that hurdle.\n\nBecause every submitted proposal first requires a discussion phase, and then a\nvoting phase of a minimum of one week, don’t hesitate to let the community about\nyour idea as soon as possible. This would ensure that the ecosystem and treasury\nfund get used right from the start and that no time is wasted before this new\naddition to the protocol starts benefiting the project.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe entire Particl team is very excited about the new decentralized treasury\nmodel and can’t wait to see what you all come up with in terms of initiatives,\nprojects, businesses, and services. Particl now possesses the tools and\nresources to make anything happen; the sky is now the limit. It is now up to\neach and every one of us, the Particl community members, to make Particl a\nresounding success.

You can now submit your anon and blind outputs\nto the Particl team to re-activate your temporarily disabled coins.\n\nThis blog post details how to submit your claim to the team and provides all the\ninformation you need to know about it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat is the Output Claim Process?\nA few months ago, the Particl team discovered and fixed a vulnerability in the\ncode that allowed an attacker to exploit RingCT transactions to create PART\ncoins out of thin air.\n\nTo remedy the situation, the Particl team proceeded to an emergency hardfork and\nset in motion a contingency plan to stop the attacker from doing more damage. As\na result, all coins stored on anon and blind balances have been temporarily\ndisabled.\n\nThe Output Claim Process is how you can submit a claim to the team so that your\ndisabled coins can be re-enabled when the coming hardfork goes live.\n\nFor more information on the exploit, you can refer to this blog post\n[https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/]. For a deeper\nexplanation of the solutions deployed, you can refer to this one\n[https://particl.news/roadmap-to-post-inflation-hardfork/].\n\nSeparate Process From the “Low-Pass Filter”\nTo re-enable anon and blind coins that are temporarily disabled, the team\ndeployed two separate solutions; the Output Claim Process, which this blog post\nis about, and a low-pass filter.\n\nThe low-pass filter is a function that will be enabled on the day of the coming\nhardfork. It will let you re-enable any anon or blind outputs equal to or lower\nthan 200 coins yourself, without the help of the Particl team. In other words,\nif your outputs contain a number of coins equal to or lower than 200, then you\ndon’t need to go through this Output Claim Process and submit a claim to the\nteam to re-enable them.\n\nRequirements to Qualify for the Output Claim Process\nTo qualify for the Output Claim Process, you need to have (1) blind or anon\noutputs containing disabled coins and (2) at least one blind or anon balance\ncontaining more than 200 coins.\n\nHow to Submit Your Claim\n * Access the output claim portal here\n   [https://particl.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/4].\n\nThe Output Claim Process is powered by the Jira platform. The platform helps to\nstreamline the process and make it more efficient. For added security and\nprivacy, we highly recommend encrypting the data in your claim before submitting\nit on the Jira platform so that only the Particl team can access it.\n\nTo submit your claim, follow these steps.\n\n * Export your outputs in a text file using either Particl Desktop (simplest way\n   to do it) or Particl Qt (advanced users). Learn how to do it by following the\n   instructions just below this list.\n * (Optional) Encrypt the text file created in the step above using the PGP key\n   generated for that purpose (the public key is shown below this step-by-step\n   guide). This will ensure only the Particl team members in charge of the claim\n   process can access your data.\n * Navigate to the Jira portal using your favorite browser. Simply follow this\n   link [https://particl.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/4]. If you\n   don’t have an account already, create one.\n * Click on “Make a Delegated Output Claim” and fill in the necessary\n   information. Make sure to upload your .txt file containing the required data\n   to re-enable your outputs in the “Attachment” section of the form.\n * Submit your claim by clicking on “Send”.\n * Your claim is now submitted! You can track its progress directly through the\n   portal. Just make sure to note the URL somewhere so that you can refer back\n   to it at a later time.\n\nExport Output Data Using Particl Desktop\n1- Download and install the latest Particl Desktop client here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.6].\n\nRelease Particl Desktop v2.3.6 · particl/particl-desktopThis patch release\nincludes some minor usability enhancements.NB!!

It is,\nhowever, important to be aware that it is separated into two phases; the\npre-fork and post-fork phases.\n\nIf you submit your outputs for validation before the cutoff date (21st of June,\n2021), then you’ll be part of the pre-fork phase and will be able to use your\ncurrently disabled coins once the hardfork goes live. This, of course, implies\nthat your claim gets approved, which is decided on a case-by-case basis.\n\nKeep in mind that, because builds need to be ready days or even weeks in advance\nbefore the hardfork (because of the pre-notice required from exchanges), the\nactual cutoff/deadline date to submit outputs and be part of the pre-fork phase\nis roughly three (3) weeks before the hardfork takes place.\n\nIf you submit your outputs after the cutoff date (21st of June, 2021), then\nyou’ll be part of the post-fork phase. You’ll still qualify to get your outputs\nre-enabled, but you’ll have to wait for the next hardfork to come, which is, at\nthe current time, not scheduled.\n\nOutput Activation Process\nOnce you submit your claim to the Particl team, it will then be analyzed to\ndetermine whether or not they are directly linked to the attacker.

It is, however, important to be aware that <strong>it is separated into two phases</strong>; the pre-fork and post-fork phases.</p><p><strong>If you submit your outputs for validation before the cutoff date (21st of June, 2021)</strong>, then you’ll be part of the pre-fork phase and will be able to use your currently disabled coins once the hardfork goes live. This, of course, implies that your claim gets approved, which is decided on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>Keep in mind that, because builds need to be ready days or even weeks in advance before the hardfork (because of the pre-notice required from exchanges), the actual cutoff/deadline date to submit outputs and be part of the pre-fork phase is roughly three (3) weeks before the hardfork takes place.</p><p><strong>If you submit your outputs after the cutoff date (21st of June, 2021)</strong>, then you’ll be part of the post-fork phase. You’ll still qualify to get your outputs re-enabled, but you’ll have to wait for the next hardfork to come, which is, at the current time, not scheduled.</p><h1 id=\"output-activation-process\">Output Activation Process</h1><p>Once you submit your claim to the Particl team, it will then be analyzed to determine whether or not they are directly linked to the attacker. If your claim is approved, it will then be added to a whitelist that will specify what outputs will be re-enabled on the day of the hardfork.</p><p>As this process aims to prevent the attacker from moving exploited coins after the hardfork, the only criterion to have your output(s) re-enabled is that it not be owned by the attacker itself.</p><p>The Particl team has developed a tracer script that can help determine whether or not outputs are legitimate or exploited, but in some cases, more information may be required. The exact process used to validate outputs will vary on a case-by-case basis depending on various factors.</p><p>Once the Particl team validates a claim, the submitted data will then be anonymized and passed on to a second group composed of community members tasked with verifying the validated data. This process is entirely anonymous, meaning the community group can't know who submitted a specific claim. It aims at providing a second security layer to ensure no suspicious or contested claim gets approved.</p><p>If a claim would be rejected by either the Particl team or the community group, it’ll still be possible for the person making the claim to plead their case to the community by submitting a CCS proposal of their own. Any CCS proposal related to individual claims will be required to be approved by Particl stakeholders through a vote.</p><h1 id=\"data-collection-policy\">Data Collection Policy</h1><h3 id=\"data-sharing\">Data Sharing</h3><p>Only team members directly involved with the Output Claim Process will have access to the submitted data. The data will then be anonymized before being sent to the community group for the verification process. The data won't be shared with team/community members not involved in the process or with any third-party. </p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Jira is a third-party platform with access to the data uploaded to it. For this reason, we highly recommend encrypting your output data file using the PGP key provided above before submitting your claim.</blockquote><h3 id=\"data-storage\">Data Storage</h3><p>The output data will be securely kept for some time by Particl team members directly involved with the process as that helps match and validate outputs for late claims. We're looking at a period of roughly one year, after which point it'll be deleted entirely.</p><p>When, exactly, the data will be deleted will be adequately communicated in advance to give late claimers to submit their claims before data that could help them gets deleted. </p><p>Keep in mind that once a claim is validated, its associated data will be anonymized not to provide a link between the data and which user submitted it.</p><hr><p>Now that the Output Claim Process is officially live, we're getting ready to get back to normal and turn the page on this unfortunate event.

Just like the previous vote\non the Output Claim Management proposal\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/delegated-output-claim-management.html], which\nended up with a fantastic participation rate, this coming voting period is going\nto be another first in Particl’s history; the first-ever protocol consensus\nchanging vote.\n\nLet’s see what that means and explore this proposal’s timeline.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Decentralized Treasury Model Proposal in Short\nThe Decentralized Treasury Model\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/8] is a critical proposal that\nsuggests modifying the blockchain parameters to ensure a self-sustainable and\nsteady source of PART income to the ecosystem. If approved, this would lead to\ncreating a Treasury Fund that would collect, at every staked block, a number of\nPART coins that can then be used by either the Particl team or the community to\nfund initiatives and projects that benefit the Particl ecosystem.\n\nTo learn more about this proposal, you can refer directly to the proposal here\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/8] or read the related Particl\nNews blog post here\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/].\n\nThe First-Ever Protocol Consensus Voting Process\nThis proposal suggests modifying the PART emission rate and dividing block\nrewards between stakers and a Treasury Fund. And because the scope of the\nchanges proposed here are quite significant and affect the protocol directly, a\n“protocol consensus changing vote\" is thus required.\n\nA protocol consensus changing vote is not much different than any other type of\non-chain voting on Particl. The differences are with the required approval rate,\nwhich is 75% instead of 60%, and the duration of the voting process, which is\n10,080 blocks (~2 weeks) instead of 5,040 (~1 week).\n\nAside from these two differences, the process of voting on a protocol consensus\nchanging proposal is exactly the same as voting on a non-protocol consensus\nproposal.\n\nThe Timeline\nTo give enough time for stakeholders to prepare their nodes for the vote, we\nwant to reveal today the timeline that will lead us to begin this voting\nprocess. That’ll allow everyone to prepare accordingly and ensure no block is\nwasted (i.e., a block that registers no vote).\n\nThis Tuesday\nThis Tuesday (tomorrow), we will close the proposal’s discussion phase and merge\nit to get it ready for its voting phase. If you still have questions, comments,\nor general feedback about this proposal, please leave a comment on its Github\npage [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/8] before it gets merged.\n\nOn the same day, we will communicate the block numbers for when the vote will\nstart and end.

This marks a significant milestone\nfor the Particl ecosystem as it moves towards a more community-powered form of\ngovernance.\n\nLet’s break down the numbers in more detail and go over this proposal’s\nimplications.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Results Are In!\nVoting for the Delegated Output Claim Management proposal\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/delegated-output-claim-management.html] was a\nsignificant event for the Particl project. It was the first time a CCS proposal\nrequired to be approved through a vote and, for this reason, served as a great\nshowcase and test of Particl’s on-chain voting technology.\n\nWe are happy to report that the proposal was approved by Particl stakeholders,\nscoring a mindblowing 99.97% approval rate (minimum required is 60%) and a \n63.17% participation rate (minimum required is 20%). Indeed, the vote lasted for\n5,040 blocks, with 3,184 of them voting in favor of the proposal and just one\nblock voting against it.\n\nWhat About the Claim Process Now?\nWith the proposal officially approved by Particl stakeholders, now’s the time to\nget moving! As such, we can now announce that the claim period will begin\ntomorrow. To help you understand the output claim process and its timeline, we\nwill publish, tomorrow, a blog post on Particl News containing all the necessary\ninformation to submit your outputs and get them validated so that they can be\nre-enabled after the upcoming hardfork.\n\nIt’s important to be aware that the output claim process will be separated into\ntwo phases; the pre-fork and post-fork phases. \n\nIf you submit your outputs for validation before the upcoming hardfork and the\ncutoff date, then you’ll be part of the pre-fork phase and will be able to use\nyour currently disabled coins once the hardfork goes live. This, of course,\nimplies that your claim gets approved.\n\nKeep in mind that, because builds need to be ready days or even weeks in advance\nbefore the hardfork (because of the pre-notice required from exchanges), the\nactual cutoff/deadline date to submit outputs and be part of the pre-fork phase\nis actually going to be several days or weeks before the hardfork. We will\nclearly communicate this deadline before its time.\n\nIf you submit your outputs after the upcoming hardfork, then you’ll be part of\nthe post-fork phase. You’ll still qualify to get your outputs re-enabled, but\nyou’ll have to wait for the next hardfork to come, which is, at the current\ntime, not scheduled.\n\nFor this reason, we strongly recommend submitting your outputs as fast as you\ncan.\n\nHeaded Towards Community Governance\nIt is safe to say that this on-chain voting exercise, the first of its kind on\nthe Particl network, was a resounding success. It highlights just how active\nParticl stakeholders are and how willing they are to actively participate in the\ngovernance of the project.\n\nWith this highly encouraging participation rate in mind, you can expect more\nproposals requiring a vote to be published on the CCS in the weeks, months, and\nyears to come. Some of them may come from the Particl team itself, but anyone\ncan submit a proposal of their own and request a vote for it.\n\nOn that end, the Particl team would like to reiterate its position that it fully\nsupports and encourages quality community initiatives. It is by having a good\nmix of team and community proposals, as well as a significant diversity in the\nideas proposed on the CCS, that Particl will achieve optimal levels of\ndecentralization!\n\nSecond Proposal Voting to Begin This Week\nThe Delegated Output Claim Management proposal\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/delegated-output-claim-management.html] is\nonly the first proposal to require on-chain voting of many to come. As such, a\nsecond proposal, the Decentralized Treasury Model proposal\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/8], will begin its voting phase\nat the end of this week.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News as we will publish, later today, a blog post\nexplaining in detail the timeline for this proposal and its voting phase. If you\nstill have questions, comments, or general feedback about it, please leave a\ncomment on its Github page [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/8] \nbefore it gets merged into the voting phase.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOnce again, we thank you for your overwhelming support and participating in such\nnumbers in this critical first on-chain voting process for Particl. We are as\nconfident as ever moving forward with a more community-powered form of\ngovernance and are pretty excited to see all the great things we will achieve\ntogether!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

That's where you come in!\n\nIf you encounter any problem while testing this new version of Particl V3 or\nhave feedback to give, please add a \"new issue\" on Github (click here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues/new/choose]). Make sure to\nexplain in detail the problem you’ve encountered, how to reproduce it, and the\nOS you’re using. The Particl developers will then pick it up and work on it.\n\n> Note 1: The “Windows bug” preventing Particl V3 from launching properly for some\nWindows user is still present with this release. The cause has been identified\nand is currently being resolved. It is a slightly more complicated issue to fix\nand, for this reason, will be fixed in the next Particl V3 testnet build.\n> Note 2: Please follow carefully the installation instructions located in the\nsection below, especially if you’ve previously installed and run a Particl V3\ntestnet build.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started\nDownload Particl Desktop 3.0.0-RC-test003: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.0.0-RC-test003\n\nRelease Particl Desktop v3.0.0 Public Testnet (release 3) ·\nparticl/particl-desktopSecond public testnet release build for the upcoming\nParticl Desktop v3.0.0NB!!

Using the last testnet client you've used before this new release, move all\n    testnet coins from any Market wallets to a different wallet (i.e., the\n    default wallet). Close Particl Desktop entirely so that it is no longer\n    running.\n 2. While Particl Desktop is NOT running, delete the testnet wallet folder \n    profiles (located in particl/testnet).\n 3. Then, delete the folder containing the MP database (located in \n    particl-market/testnet/03).\n\nLocation of Folders on Windows\n * Profiles Folder \n\n%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Particl\\testnet or \n%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Particl\\testnet\\wallets\n\n * MP Database\n\n%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\particl-market\\testnet\\03\"\n\nLocation of Folders on MacOS\n * Profiles Folder\n\n~/Library/Application Support/Particl/testnet\n\n * MP Database\n\n~/Library/Application Support/particl-market/testnet/03\n\nLocation of Folders on Linux\n * Profiles Folder\n\n~/.particl/testnet\n\n * MP Database\n\n~/.particl-market/testnet/03\n\nDiscussions and Feedback\nYour insights are infinitely valuable for us to enhance and improve Particl\nDesktop and Particl Marketplace. To that end, the Particl community forum\n[https://particl.community/] is the perfect place for focused discussions and to\nget to know what others have observed.\n\nTo help to streamline community testing for Particl V3-testnet, the community\nhas prepared a Marketplace Testing category to the forum where you can report\nissues to other community members and see what others are coming up with. Simply\nfollow this link [https://particl.community/category/16/marketplace-testing] to\nland in the right place.\n\nStill, if you find any observation that has found a certain degree of consensus,\nyou are kindly asked to formally publish it on the Github Issues\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] page. This way, it is\nguaranteed that the developers won’t miss it.\n\nNotes\n * If you encounter problems connecting to peers, it may be caused by the low\n   number of nodes on the testnet network. To fix this issue, open up your\n   Particl Desktop debug console and type the following command to connect to a\n   seeding node:\n   addnode \"212.47.250.16:51938\" \"add\"\n * If you spot any issue, bug, or area of improvement, please report it directly\n   on the Github Issues [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] \n   page.\n * Your wallet needs to be unlocked to process buy and sell orders on the\n   marketplace.\n * Particl Marketplace is still in on-going development, and thus, is considered\n   to be a Beta release.\n * NB!! The source code linked to here is not the actual tagged release source\n   code. Please contact the Particl team for source code information. The actual\n   source code will be uploaded and made available after an appropriate interval\n   of time has passed.\n\nAdvanced Start-up\nSometimes it's helpful to start the application from the terminal, aka command\nline. It gives you additional information about what's happening in the\nbackground.\n\nWindows\n 1. Open \"Windows Explorer\"\n 2. On the installation folder (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\Particl Desktop\n    Testnet\\Particl Desktop Testnet\") Press [SHIFT⇧]+[MOUSE-RIGHT◳] and choose\n    \"Open command window here\"\n 3. Type the following command including the quotation marks into the terminal\n    and hit [ENTER ↵] \"Particl Desktop Testnet.exe\"\n\nMac\n 1. Open \"Terminal\" \n    (e.g. [COMMAND ⌘] + [SPACE] and type terminal > hit [ENTER ↵])\n 2. Type in this command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    /Applications/Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet.app/Contents/MacOS/Particl\\ Desktop\\\n    Testnet\n\nLinux\n 1. Open a terminal in the folder where you’ve installed the application and\n    type the following command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    ./Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChangelog\nWhat follows is a list of changes, bug fixes, and improvements made to Particl\nV3 since its first testnet release. This list is not exhaustive, it does not\ninclude some of the smaller and/or less impactful fixes.\n\nParticl Market\n- Update how categories are retrieved for various markets\n\n- Blacklisting of markets (when flagging/voting to remove markets) should not\nhappen when voting but when calculating the vote result\n\n- Prevent automatic deletion of any old/expired listings that are still included\nin a cart\n\n- Fixed removal of a joined market failing if the market has been flagged by the\ncurrent user\n\n- Updated the default categories for Open Market type of markets.\n\nParticl Desktop (Market Module)\n- Updated the identity drop-down toggle as it appears to do nothing if identity\ncreation/addition is disabled and there are no additional identities available\n(which is the default state)\n\n- Present a previously missing \"unlock wallet\" prompt when attempting to create\na new market with an encrypted (locked) wallet\n\n- Display a more applicable error message when accepting a bid fails due to\ninsufficient funds\n\n- Swapped the positions of the public and anon balance amounts in the Overview\ncomponent (to make more sense, and was requested quite a bit by the community)\n\n- Display when a promoted market expires in the Market Browser tab.\n\n- Set the 'Completed and Archived' checkbox in both the Buy > Orders page and\nthe Sell > Orders page, to be checked by default. This addresses a concern that\ncompleted or cancelled orders seemed to disappear\n\n- Changed the country selection filters in the Browse [Listings] page to render\nwith check boxes next to the country name. Clearing a country filter by\nre-selecting it was not very clear before, and this attempts to guide the user\nby indicating that that a selected country can be re-selected to clear it\n\n- After successfully creating a storefront market, the category editor opens to\ndirect the storefront admin to add categories\n\n- Fixed input validation criteria on the Create Market page: max character\nlengths were not validating correctly.\n\n- Display the market ID key on each promoted market, so as to provide a unique\nidentifier for a promoted market.\n\n- Updated the code for retrieving the correct market category list when\npublishing products (necessary due to changes in the Market system's handling of\nlisting categories)\n\n- Fixed an intermittent issue when editing a previously created product in which\na market and category were selected and saved: the category may not have always\nbeen shown to be selected correctly, and the category list may have shown the\nincorrect category list.\n\n- Added an option to navigate back to 'Products and Listings' from the 'Product\nImport' section (previously the only option was to use the main menu to navigate\nback to the 'Sell' page, and subsequently to the 'Products and Listings' tab).\n\n- Fixed the linked URL for Transaction ID's displayed for an order in both the\nBuy > Orders page and the Sell > Orders page, that would always point to the\nmainnet block explorer rather than the testnet block explorer when running on\nthe testnet chain.\n\n-Fixed order notification counters not working as intended, particularly around\ncancelled/rejected/completed orders\n\nParticl Desktop (Wallet Module)\n- Allow for the transaction ID to be copied in both the Overview page as well as\nthe Transaction History page\n\n- Added a warning during address label editing that indicates that the label is\nnot saved until the save button is clicked\n\n- Zapping of cold staking funds is now disabled when the wallet balance is 0\n\n- Fixed an issue preventing someone from disabling cold staking when their\nwallet balance funds is 0.\n\nParticl Desktop (Layout and Styling)\n- Simplified the display of the wallet module's transaction table entries (also\nas viewed on the wallet module's Overview page)\n\n- Tweaked the background blur for modals (looks nicer now)\n\n- Aligned visual changes made in other tweaks with the overall application theme\n(i.e., updated the market visualization in the market browser for the displaying\nof the unique market ID as well as the displaying of the market promotion\nexpiration time)\n\n- Added an explicit section in the market creation page detailing how a created\nmarket is private by default unless the keys are shared or the market is\npromoted\n\n- Minor styling tweaks and cleanup of unused styles\n\nGeneral\n- Enabled the generation of Windows 32-bit builds again\n\n- Fixed an error message being displayed that crashes the application when the\nuser closes the application while the market module is starting up.\n\n- Testing, updates and fixes related to updating Particl Core versions 0.19.2.5 \nto 0.19.2.8\n\n- Allow for specific URLs to be opened in the user's current browser instead of\nin a webview container within the application\n\n- Applied port of code from PD v2.3 to fix parsing of startup params/flags that\ncontain dashes\n\n- Applied port of code from PD v2.3 to allow for the core console modal to\nprocess command string escapings as per Particl Core\n\n- Fixed various spelling mistakes in the text\n\n- Added the ability to display a randomized \"Message of the Day\" on the\nloading/welcome page. These are not currently displayed as the messages are not\nyet available, but the functionality is now available\n\n- Updated text strings where applicable\n\n- Fixed CircleCI test runner to execute again (note: just gets CircleCI running\nagain - testing still fails due to problematic test cases which still need to be\nfixed and/or written)\n\n- Enabled codespell checks during test execution\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe second round of community testing has started, now let's get cracking! Don't\nforget to also spread the word around about the upcoming Particl V3 mainnet\nrelease. Every bit helps, whether that is testing, promoting, or even just\nsharing screenshots and GIFs of Particl V3! \n\nWe are blessed to have such a dedicated and passionate community, and for this\nreason, we'd like to thank you for your continued support and patience as we get\nthis baby ready for mainnet!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This list is not exhaustive, it does not include some of the smaller and/or less impactful fixes.</p><h3 id=\"particl-market\">Particl Market</h3><p>- Update how categories are retrieved for various markets</p><p>- Blacklisting of markets (when flagging/voting to remove markets) should not happen when voting but when calculating the vote result</p><p>- Prevent automatic deletion of any old/expired listings that are still included in a cart</p><p>- Fixed removal of a joined market failing if the market has been flagged by the current user</p><p>- Updated the default categories for Open Market type of markets.</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-market-module-\">Particl Desktop (Market Module)</h3><p>- Updated the identity drop-down toggle as it appears to do nothing if identity creation/addition is disabled and there are no additional identities available (which is the default state)</p><p>- Present a previously missing \"unlock wallet\" prompt when attempting to create a new market with an encrypted (locked) wallet</p><p>- Display a more applicable error message when accepting a bid fails due to insufficient funds</p><p>- Swapped the positions of the public and anon balance amounts in the Overview component (to make more sense, and was requested quite a bit by the community)</p><p>- Display when a promoted market expires in the Market Browser tab.</p><p>- Set the 'Completed and Archived' checkbox in both the Buy &gt; Orders page and the Sell &gt; Orders page, to be checked by default. This addresses a concern that completed or cancelled orders seemed to disappear</p><p>- Changed the country selection filters in the Browse [Listings] page to render with check boxes next to the country name. Clearing a country filter by re-selecting it was not very clear before, and this attempts to guide the user by indicating that that a selected country can be re-selected to clear it</p><p>- After successfully creating a storefront market, the category editor opens to direct the storefront admin to add categories</p><p>- Fixed input validation criteria on the Create Market page: max character lengths were not validating correctly.</p><p>- Display the market ID key on each promoted market, so as to provide a unique identifier for a promoted market.</p><p>- Updated the code for retrieving the correct market category list when publishing products (necessary due to changes in the Market system's handling of listing categories)</p><p>- Fixed an intermittent issue when editing a previously created product in which a market and category were selected and saved: the category may not have always been shown to be selected correctly, and the category list may have shown the incorrect category list.</p><p>- Added an option to navigate back to 'Products and Listings' from the 'Product Import' section (previously the only option was to use the main menu to navigate back to the 'Sell' page, and subsequently to the 'Products and Listings' tab).</p><p>- Fixed the linked URL for Transaction ID's displayed for an order in both the Buy &gt; Orders page and the Sell &gt; Orders page, that would always point to the mainnet block explorer rather than the testnet block explorer when running on the testnet chain.</p><p>-Fixed order notification counters not working as intended, particularly around cancelled/rejected/completed orders</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-wallet-module-\">Particl Desktop (Wallet Module)</h3><p>- Allow for the transaction ID to be copied in both the Overview page as well as the Transaction History page</p><p>- Added a warning during address label editing that indicates that the label is not saved until the save button is clicked</p><p>- Zapping of cold staking funds is now disabled when the wallet balance is 0</p><p>- Fixed an issue preventing someone from disabling cold staking when their wallet balance funds is 0.</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-layout-and-styling-\">Particl Desktop (Layout and Styling)</h3><p>- Simplified the display of the wallet module's transaction table entries (also as viewed on the wallet module's Overview page)</p><p>- Tweaked the background blur for modals (looks nicer now)</p><p>- Aligned visual changes made in other tweaks with the overall application theme (i.e., updated the market visualization in the market browser for the displaying of the unique market ID as well as the displaying of the market promotion expiration time)</p><p>- Added an explicit section in the market creation page detailing how a created market is private by default unless the keys are shared or the market is promoted</p><p>- Minor styling tweaks and cleanup of unused styles</p><h3 id=\"general\">General</h3><p>- Enabled the generation of Windows 32-bit builds again</p><p>- Fixed an error message being displayed that crashes the application when the user closes the application while the market module is starting up.</p><p>- Testing, updates and fixes related to updating Particl Core versions <code>0.19.2.5</code> to <code>0.19.2.8</code></p><p>- Allow for specific URLs to be opened in the user's current browser instead of in a webview container within the application</p><p>- Applied port of code from PD v2.3 to fix parsing of startup params/flags that contain dashes</p><p>- Applied port of code from PD v2.3 to allow for the core console modal to process command string escapings as per Particl Core</p><p>- Fixed various spelling mistakes in the text</p><p>- Added the ability to display a randomized \"Message of the Day\" on the loading/welcome page. These are not currently displayed as the messages are not yet available, but the functionality is now available</p><p>- Updated text strings where applicable</p><p>- Fixed CircleCI test runner to execute again (note: just gets CircleCI running again - testing still fails due to problematic test cases which still need to be fixed and/or written)</p><p>- Enabled codespell checks during test execution</p><hr><p>The second round of community testing has started, now let's get cracking! Don't forget to also spread the word around about the upcoming Particl V3 mainnet release.

It breaks down the proposed solutions to re-enable temporarily\ndisabled anon and blind outputs and the strategy used to re-establish the\nblockchain’s integrity with the correct supply moving forward.\n\nTo get up to speed with that information, simply follow the Particl News link\nlocated at the top of this section.\n\n> Note: An update has been added to the above blog post to indicate how to collect\nand submit outputs using the new Particl Desktop 2.3.6 release.\nIncreased Focus on Community Governance\nOn-Chain Voting and CCS ProposalsLearn everything about Particl’s on-chain\nvoting system and how it ties into community CCS proposals!Blogcryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/on-chain-voting-and-ccs-proposals/]Over the past weeks and\nmonths, the Particl project has initiated a significant shift towards a more\ndecentralized method of governance. This shift aims at putting you, every\ncommunity member, into a more important position of power over what happens with\nthe project.\n\nAs such, in April, the Particl team has released a critical blog post detailing\nhow the project would be moving forward using the combination of an on-chain\nvoting tool and the CCS proposal system.\n\nThe on-chain voting system, which uses staking to register votes on the\nblockchain, will be used to vote on proposals put forward by the community on\nthe CCS.\n\nIf you’ve got a great idea, project, or service you want to provide to the\nParticl ecosystem, you can now publish a CCS proposal for it and get it voted on\nby the community.\n\nFor all the details on the on-chain voting system and to know how it ties in\nwith the CCS system, check out this blog post available on Particl News\n[https://particl.news/on-chain-voting-and-ccs-proposals/].\n\nDecentralized Treasury Model\nDecentralized Treasury Model ProposalLearn more about the new CCS proposal to\nform a new decentralized treasury model to support the Particl ecosystem.Blog\ncryptoguard [https://particl.news/decentralized-treasury-model-proposal/]To\nempower the community even more and foster an even more efficient governance\nmodel, the team has suggested introducing a new decentralized treasury model\nthat could fund the project in a self-sustainable manner.\n\nThis decentralized treasury model, which will be published as a CCS proposal in\nthe coming days, suggests increasing the yearly staking rate (APR) from 2% to\n8%. Then, 50% of the block rewards would go directly to stakers, and the other\n50% would land in the decentralized treasury model.\n\nThe Particl team, like other community members, will then be able to craft\nproposals and claim funds from the treasury for various projects that benefit\nthe Particl ecosystem. Of course, any proposal that requests funds from the\ntreasury will need to be voted on and approved by the community using the\non-chain voting system mentioned in the section above.\n\nIn May, the team’s going to publish, on Particl News, an important blog post\nexplaining its vision moving forward, how it intends on claiming and using funds\nfrom the treasury, the nature of a new legal entity created for that purpose,\nand so on. Keep your eyes peeled on Particl News for when that blog post lands.\n\nFirst Proposal to Require a Vote Now Live on the CCS\nDelegated Output Claim Management by cryptoguard · Pull Request #7 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal is to implement a streamlined and\nmore\nefficient way to process manual output claims and reactivate temporarily\ndisabled anon and blind balances.RationaleOn the 25th of Febr...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/7]April also saw the first CCS\nproposal ever to require an on-chain community vote to be activated. Indeed,\ncreated out of firm community feedback, the Delegated Output Claim Management\nProposal [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/7] suggests nominating a\ngroup composed of a few Particl team members to receive, process, and validate\nindividual claims to re-enable temporarily disabled outputs. \n\nOnce validated, the proof would be forwarded to a second group, this one\ncomposed of a few community members, to confirm the validated claims. This\nsecond group acts as an additional layer of checks and balances to ensure no\nclaim is wrongly approved without proper evidence of its authenticity.\n\nIt seeks to put in place a more streamlined, simple, efficient, and sure-fire\nmethod to reactivate outputs, one that would not ultimately be dependent upon\nthe assumed participation and goodwill of stakers.\n\nThis proposal, which is currently in its discussion phase, will be opened up for\nvoting in the next few days. If you have any questions or comments, you can\nvisit the AMA/FAQ thread dedicated to this proposal on Reddit by following this\nlink\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/n0ld5d/amafaq_delegated_output_claim_management_proposal/]\n.\n\nParticl V3 Progress Report\nNew Particl Releases and V3 Progress ReportDownload and install the new Particl\nDesktop and Core releases and get up to speed with the latest Particl V3\nprogress report.Blogcryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/new-particl-releases-and-v3-progress-report/]As Particl V3\nnears completion for its mainnet release, a development progress report has been\npublished during April. It explains, in detail, what’s been completed since the\nlast report, what’s being worked on, and also what’s left to complete for the\nnext testnet round to go live.\n\nInterestingly, the report also mentions that all slowdowns and issues mentioned\nin the March 2021 Project Update have been resolved and that Particl V3\ndevelopment is back at its usual, full pace. You can now expect more frequent\ndevelopment updates regarding Particl Desktop (Particl V3) and other components\nof the Particl ecosystem.\n\nNew Particl Desktop and Core releases\nNew Particl Releases and V3 Progress ReportDownload and install the new Particl\nDesktop and Core releases and get up to speed with the latest Particl V3\nprogress report.Blogcryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/new-particl-releases-and-v3-progress-report/]To help users\nsubmit their outputs to the team, new Particl Core (0.19.2.6) and Particl\nDesktop (2.3.6) releases have been pushed to Github. These releases will also\nease and simplify the process for users to submit individual claims to re-enable\ntemporarily disabled anon and blind outputs when the time comes for it.\n\nAs always, it’s highly recommended to update your Particl client to the latest\nversion.\n\nWork on BasicSwap Resumes\nNow that the code for the second hardfork and the tracer script is complete,\nParticl Lead Core Developer Tecnovert has resumed working on BasicSwap,\nParticl’s upcoming atomic swap based DEX.\n\nBasicSwap, which enables trustless and private swaps between different\ncryptocurrencies (not just in and out of PART), is poised to play a vital role\nwithin the Particl ecosystem moving forward. Not only will it provide more\nresilience against the power exchanges hold over Particl, but it’ll also make\nacquiring PART easier, more accessible, and entirely anonymous. An integration\nof BasicSwap into Particl Desktop is planned and is currently in progress (more\ndetails on that in a later Particl News blog post).\n\nAs development continues, BasicSwap will soon be opened for testing as a public\nbeta. Stay vigilant as it will be announced on Particl News when ready.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet prepared for May as things are about to lift for Particl. You can expect the\nvoting periods for two major proposals to go live, which will mark a new phase\nfor the Particl project, one more focused on community governance and\ndecentralization.\n\nThings are about to get exciting and move forward at a much faster pace than the\npast few months.

These are the output claim management proposal and the one to enable\na brand new, powerful treasury model.\n\nThat’s directly in line with our recent efforts to put more focus on community\ngovernance and improve the degree of decentralization of the project. This now\nputs you in a much more influential position.\n\nToday, we are thrilled to reveal all the details and parameters of this on-chain\nand entirely decentralized voting mechanism.\n\nLet’s jump right in!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Contents\n * CCS Proposals\n * On-Chain Voting\n * Approval Rates, Quorum, Duration, and Consensus\n   [/on-chain-voting-and-ccs-proposals/approval-rates-quorum-duration-and-consensus]\n * Potential Voting Outcomes\n * Proposal Lifecycle\n * Community Fund\n * First Proposal Coming in on Wednesday\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCCS Proposals\nAs explained, in detail, in the introductory blog post of the CCS\n[https://particl.news/new-community-crowdfunding-system-f31f54231982/], anyone\ncan submit proposals on the CCS to request donations for initiatives from the\ncommunity. The introduction of the CCS was the first step in improving the level\nof decentralization and put in place a solid governance mechanism. The on-chain\nvoting system, which is now integrated into the CCS, is the next step to that\nmission.\n\nOn-Chain Voting\nThe on-chain network voting system is an additional governance tool that you can\nnow use to let your voice be heard. Any CCS proposal can now request a network\nvote to determine consensus. The most common use for network votes will be for\nproposals requesting initiatives to be funded from the Community Fund, but can\nbe used for other purposes as well. That's all up to the proposal owner!\n\nThe voting system works using staking weight, meaning that you register a vote\nevery time you stake a block on the network. This ensures that only those with a\nstake or interest in the project can vote, preventing outside influence from\naffecting the votes unjustly. It also encourages more people to stake their\ncoins to vote, which increases the network’s security and performance at the\nsame time.\n\nThe main benefit of on-chain voting compared to the legacy, SMSG-based voting\nsystem that was present in Particl Desktop is auditability and provability. With\nthis system, all votes, and their tallied results, are permanently written on\nthe blockchain, and results can provably be observed at any later time without\nany risk of tampering.\n\nIt's important to mention that staking pools, whose staking weight is made up of\nall the coins staked on the pool, also possess the power to vote. The more coins\na pool contains, the more voting power it has.\n\n> Note: For a vote to be counted, you need to successfully stake a block within\nthe voting period. If you own a small balance of PART (< 1,000 PART), it is\nlikely that you don’t stake a block every week and thus, won’t register a vote.\nApproval Rates, Quorum, Duration, and Consensus\n\nFor a proposal’s voting process to be considered valid, there are three\nrequirements to fill. They are the quorum requirement, the approval rate, and\nthe minimum duration of the voting process. The quorum requirement is determined\nby what percentage of the blocks within a given voting process cast a vote. The\napproval rate is defined by the percentage of the votes cast being in favor of a\nproposal.\n\nProposals that require a vote are separated into two different categories, each\none with its own value requirements.\n\nNon Protocol Consensus Votes\n * Quorum: 20% of blocks during the voting period\n * Approval rate: >= 60% in favor\n * Duration: 5,040 blocks minimum\n\nNon protocol consensus votes are proposals that do not require a major change in\nthe protocol to be made. Typically, they would be proposals claiming funds from\nthe Community Fund, for example, or determining the direction of a particular\ninitiative.\n\nFor a non protocol consensus vote to be considered valid, its voting period must\nbe a minimum of 5,040 blocks (roughly one week). Within that period, 20% of the\nblocks staked need to cast a vote for one of the available voting options. That\nmeans the quorum has to be at least 20%. Finally, to be considered as approved\nby the community, it needs to reach an approval rate of at least 60%, meaning at\nleast 60% of all the votes cast for the proposal are in favor of the proposed\nidea.\n\nProtocol Consensus Votes\n * Quorum: 20% of blocks during the voting period\n * Approval rate: >= 75% in favor\n * Duration: 10,080 blocks minimum\n\nProtocol consensus votes are a bit more important in scope and can have a more\nsignificant impact on the ecosystem. They are any proposal that requires a\nspecific change in the protocol, such as, for example, integrating a\ndecentralized treasury model, modifying the inflation rate of the blockchain,\nintroducing a new privacy technology, etc.\n\nJust like non protocol consensus votes, their quorum requirement stands at 20%.\nBut because of their increased level of importance and ramifications, they\nrequire a higher level of approval from the community. In fact, the required \napproval rate has to be at least 75%. Finally, the duration of any protocol\nconsensus vote has to be a minimum of 10,080 blocks (roughly two weeks) to give\nample time to anyone to be able to cast their vote.\n\nPotential Voting Outcomes\nThere are a few possible scenarios to a vote. Here they are with their\nrespective outcome.\n\n * If quorum is not met, the proposal is REJECTED ❌\n * If the quorum is met but the votes fail to meet the target approval rate, the\n   proposal is REJECTED ❌\n * If the quorum is met and the votes reach the approval rate (“Yes”), the\n   proposal is APPROVED ✅\n * If a voting round reaches its expiration before reaching quorum or the target\n   approval rate, the proposal expires and is REJECTED ❌\n\nProposal Lifecycle\nBelow is the basic process for submitting and evaluating proposals that require\na vote.\n\n * A proposal is submitted on the CCS. Click here\n   [https://ccs.particl.io/how-to-ccs/] to see how to submit your own proposal.\n * The proposal owner indicates, in the header, whether the proposal requires a\n   vote or not.\n * The proposal is reviewed by the CCS administrators and then published.\n * Valid proposals are open for discussion for a minimum of one week but voting\n   does not begin immediately. The proposal can be edited by its owner in\n   response to community feedback.\n * If a proposal becomes clearly inactive (proposal owner stops commenting on\n   the proposal or does not authorize the start of voting), a CCS administrator\n   may mark the proposal as “Abandoned”. Abandoned proposals are publicly\n   viewable, but cannot be edited, commented on, or be authorized to vote. A CCS\n   administrator can mark a proposal as abandoned at any time before the\n   proposal owner authorizes voting. Once the proposal owner authorizes voting\n   on a proposal, it cannot be abandoned unless the proposal owner revokes\n   voting on the proposal.\n * The proposal owner authorizes voting to start. A CCS administrator will then\n   assign a voting block interval to it (duration of the voting period).\n * The voting period begins for the number of blocks assigned by the\n   administrator. For example, one week is around 5,040 blocks.\n * When the voting period ends, the proposal is formally approved or rejected.\n   This depends on if the quorum and the approval rate are met.\n * When a proposal with a budget and deliverables is approved, work can begin.\n   The proposal owner can submit claims for funds upon completion of the\n   milestone deliverables that are pre-defined within the proposal.\n\nCommunity Fund\nInsightParticl Insight. View detailed information on all particl transactions\nand blocks.\n[https://explorer.particl.io/address/RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM]If you\nhave a great project or business you wish to build on Particl, or if there’s a\nservice you want to provide to the ecosystem, you may require funds to make it\nhappen. Ever since the initial release of the CCS, the only way to get that\nfunding was through community donations.\n\nWith the on-chain voting system, you will soon be able to claim funds from the \nCommunity Fund\n[https://explorer.particl.io/address/RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM] to help\nyou realize your initiative. And because this Community Fund belongs to all PART\nholders, it needs their approval to draw funds from it.\n\nIndeed, to incentivize more use of the CCS system by the community, the team is\ngoing to open up the Community Fund. All you’ll need to do to claim the funds is\ncraft a clear proposal that requires a vote and explains your initiative in\ndetail as well as why you need the funds. Then, you need to convince the Particl\ncommunity to vote in favor of your proposal and approve the claim of funds.\n\nFirst Proposal Coming in on Wednesday!\nYou won’t have to wait for too long to put on your first vote! As soon as this \nWednesday (28th of April, 2021), we will publish the first-ever proposal to\nrequire the use of the on-chain voting system.\n\nThis proposal, which was widely requested by the community, seeks to nominate\nthe Particl team as managers of the manual claim process required to unfreeze\nall legitimate anon and blind coins. These coins are currently frozen as part of\nthe emergency hardfork deployed by the team weeks ago and they need to be\nre-enabled as smoothly as possible. Keep an eye out on Particl News and the CCS\non Wednesday for all the details on the proposal!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith the support of the on-chain voting system as well as the upcoming few\nproposals, the Particl project is entering a brand new phase that emphasizes the\npower of the community much more. If you’ve ever had a great idea for a project,\nbusiness, or service you think would benefit the Particl ecosystem, you’ll have\nall the tools you need to make it happen, if you can convince the community!\n\nThis addition to the CCS marks a significant milestone for the project and\nshould lead to many more community contributions than we’ve ever seen. Don’t\nforget, if the decentralized treasury model proposal is approved, the Community\nFund is also going to grow in value and, if the price of PART increases, will\ngrow exponentially in value, opening even more doors. This has tremendous\npotential and we can’t wait to see what you, the community, will create with\nthese resources!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

The introduction of the CCS was the first step in improving the level of decentralization and put in place a solid governance mechanism. The on-chain voting system, which is now integrated into the CCS, is the next step to that mission.</p><h1 id=\"on-chain-voting\">On-Chain Voting</h1><p>The on-chain network voting system is an additional governance tool that you can now use to let your voice be heard. Any CCS proposal can now request a network vote to determine consensus. The most common use for network votes will be for proposals requesting initiatives to be funded from the Community Fund, but can be used for other purposes as well. That's all up to the proposal owner!</p><p>The voting system works using staking weight, meaning that you register a vote every time you stake a block on the network. This ensures that only those with a stake or interest in the project can vote, preventing outside influence from affecting the votes unjustly. It also encourages more people to stake their coins to vote, which increases the network’s security and performance at the same time.</p><p>The main benefit of on-chain voting compared to the legacy, SMSG-based voting system that was present in Particl Desktop is auditability and provability. With this system, all votes, and their tallied results, are permanently written on the blockchain, and results can provably be observed at any later time without any risk of tampering.</p><p>It's important to mention that staking pools, whose staking weight is made up of all the coins staked on the pool, also possess the power to vote. The more coins a pool contains, the more voting power it has.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> For a vote to be counted, you need to successfully stake a block within the voting period. If you own a small balance of PART (&#x3C; 1,000 PART), it is likely that you don’t stake a block every week and thus, won’t register a vote.</em></blockquote><h1 id=\"approval-rates-quorum-duration-and-consensus\">Approval Rates, Quorum, Duration, and Consensus</h1><p><br>For a proposal’s voting process to be considered valid, there are three requirements to fill. They are the <strong>quorum requirement</strong>, the <strong>approval rate</strong>, and the <strong>minimum duration of the voting process</strong>. The quorum requirement is determined by what percentage of the blocks within a given voting process cast a vote. The approval rate is defined by the percentage of the votes cast being in favor of a proposal.</p><p>Proposals that require a vote are separated into two different categories, each one with its own value requirements.</p><h3 id=\"non-protocol-consensus-votes\">Non Protocol Consensus Votes</h3><ul><li><strong>Quorum:</strong> 20% of blocks during the voting period</li><li><strong>Approval rate:</strong> >= 60% in favor</li><li><strong>Duration:</strong> 5,040 blocks minimum</li></ul><p>Non protocol consensus votes are proposals that do not require a major change in the protocol to be made. Typically, they would be proposals claiming funds from the Community Fund, for example, or determining the direction of a particular initiative.</p><p>For a non protocol consensus vote to be considered valid, its voting period must be a <strong>minimum of 5,040 blocks (roughly one week). </strong>Within that period, 20% of the blocks staked need to cast a vote for one of the available voting options. That means <strong>the quorum has to be at least 20%</strong>. Finally, to be considered as approved by the community, it needs to reach an <strong>approval rate of at least 60%</strong>, meaning at least 60% of all the votes cast for the proposal are in favor of the proposed idea.</p><h3 id=\"protocol-consensus-votes\">Protocol Consensus Votes</h3><ul><li><strong>Quorum:</strong> 20% of blocks during the voting period</li><li><strong>Approval rate:</strong> >= 75% in favor</li><li><strong>Duration:</strong> 10,080 blocks minimum</li></ul><p>Protocol consensus votes are a bit more important in scope and can have a more significant impact on the ecosystem. They are any proposal that requires a specific change in the protocol, such as, for example, integrating a decentralized treasury model, modifying the inflation rate of the blockchain, introducing a new privacy technology, etc.</p><p>Just like non protocol consensus votes, their <strong>quorum requirement stands at 20%</strong>. But because of their increased level of importance and ramifications, they require a higher level of approval from the community. In fact, the required <strong>approval rate has to be at least 75%</strong>. Finally, the duration of any protocol consensus vote has to be a <strong>minimum of 10,080 blocks (roughly two weeks)</strong> to give ample time to anyone to be able to cast their vote.</p><h1 id=\"potential-voting-outcomes\">Potential Voting Outcomes</h1><p>There are a few possible scenarios to a vote. Here they are with their respective outcome.</p><ul><li>If quorum is not met, the proposal is <strong>REJECTED </strong>❌</li><li>If the quorum is met but the votes fail to meet the target approval rate, the proposal is <strong>REJECTED </strong>❌</li><li>If the quorum is met and the votes reach the approval rate (“Yes”), the proposal is <strong>APPROVED </strong>✅</li><li>If a voting round reaches its expiration before reaching quorum or the target approval rate, the proposal expires and is <strong>REJECTED </strong>❌</li></ul><h1 id=\"proposal-lifecycle\">Proposal Lifecycle</h1><p>Below is the basic process for submitting and evaluating proposals that require a vote.</p><ul><li>A proposal is submitted on the CCS. <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io/how-to-ccs/\"><strong>Click here</strong></a> to see how to submit your own proposal.</li><li>The proposal owner indicates, in the header, whether the proposal requires a vote or not.</li><li>The proposal is reviewed by the CCS administrators and then published.</li><li>Valid proposals are open for discussion for a minimum of one week but voting does not begin immediately. The proposal can be edited by its owner in response to community feedback.</li><li>If a proposal becomes clearly inactive (proposal owner stops commenting on the proposal or does not authorize the start of voting), a CCS administrator may mark the proposal as “Abandoned”. Abandoned proposals are publicly viewable, but cannot be edited, commented on, or be authorized to vote. A CCS administrator can mark a proposal as abandoned at any time before the proposal owner authorizes voting. Once the proposal owner authorizes voting on a proposal, it cannot be abandoned unless the proposal owner revokes voting on the proposal.</li><li>The proposal owner authorizes voting to start. A CCS administrator will then assign a voting block interval to it (duration of the voting period).</li><li>The voting period begins for the number of blocks assigned by the administrator. For example, one week is around 5,040 blocks.</li><li>When the voting period ends, the proposal is formally approved or rejected. This depends on if the quorum and the approval rate are met.</li><li>When a proposal with a budget and deliverables is approved, work can begin. The proposal owner can submit claims for funds upon completion of the milestone deliverables that are pre-defined within the proposal.</li></ul><h2 id=\"community-fund\">Community Fund</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://explorer.particl.io/address/RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Insight</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Particl Insight.

Ever since the initial release of the CCS, the only way to get that funding was through community donations.</p><p>With the on-chain voting system, you will soon be able to claim funds from the <strong><a href=\"https://explorer.particl.io/address/RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM\">Community Fund</a></strong> to help you realize your initiative. And because this Community Fund belongs to all PART holders, it needs their approval to draw funds from it.</p><p>Indeed, to incentivize more use of the CCS system by the community, the team is going to open up the Community Fund. All you’ll need to do to claim the funds is craft a clear proposal that requires a vote and explains your initiative in detail as well as why you need the funds. Then, you need to convince the Particl community to vote in favor of your proposal and approve the claim of funds.</p><h1 id=\"first-proposal-coming-in-on-wednesday-\">First Proposal Coming in on Wednesday!</h1><p>You won’t have to wait for too long to put on your first vote! As soon as this <strong>Wednesday (28th of April, 2021)</strong>, we will publish the first-ever proposal to require the use of the on-chain voting system.<br><br>This proposal, which was widely requested by the community, seeks to nominate the Particl team as managers of the manual claim process required to unfreeze all legitimate anon and blind coins. These coins are currently frozen as part of the emergency hardfork deployed by the team weeks ago and they need to be re-enabled as smoothly as possible. Keep an eye out on Particl News and the CCS on Wednesday for all the details on the proposal!</p><hr><p>With the support of the on-chain voting system as well as the upcoming few proposals, the Particl project is entering a brand new phase that emphasizes the power of the community much more. If you’ve ever had a great idea for a project, business, or service you think would benefit the Particl ecosystem, you’ll have all the tools you need to make it happen, if you can convince the community!</p><p>This addition to the CCS marks a significant milestone for the project and should lead to many more community contributions than we’ve ever seen. Don’t forget, if the decentralized treasury model proposal is approved, the Community Fund is also going to grow in value and, if the price of PART increases, will grow exponentially in value, opening even more doors. This has tremendous potential and we can’t wait to see what you, the community, will create with these resources!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

Core 0.19.2.6 and \nParticl Desktop 2.3.6. These releases aim to ease and streamline the process of\nidentifying anon and blind outputs to assist the team in selecting the best path\nforward and help reveal exploited outputs that can then be blacklisted.\n\nBelow this post, you’ll find a detailed progress report for Particl V3. If you\nwant to jump straight to it, you can click here.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop 2.3.6 and Particl Core 0.19.2.6\nRelease Particl Desktop v2.3.6 · particl/particl-desktopThis patch release\nincludes some minor usability enhancements.NB!! The source code linked to here\nis not the actual tagged release source code. Please contact Particl for source\ncode information. ...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.6] * Desktop\n   download: [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.0.1]\n   https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.6\n * Core\n   download: [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.3]\n   https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.6\n\nParticl Desktop 2.3.6 introduces a new GUI tool to quickly identify the anon and\nblind outputs from all your unlocked wallets. It uses the new Particl Core\n0.19.2.6 release, which improves the output tracing script.\n\nTo see the complete list of changes for Particl Core 0.19.2.6, follow this link\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/branch_0.19.2.6/doc/release-notes-particl.md#01926]\n.\n\nTo use the new tool, simply follow these steps.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1- Open Particl Desktop 2.3.6 and ensure you are running Particl Core 0.19.2.6.\n\n2- Unlock all of your wallets by opening each of them in the bar on the left and\nclicking the lock pad icon at the top right corner of the client.\n\n3- Once all your wallets are unlocked, click on the printer icon at the top\nright corner of the client and a new window will appear.\n\n4- Choose where you want to export your output data, and then click on the \nExport button.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter clicking the Export button, a file named frozen_blinded_data.txt will be\ncreated in the location of your choice. To submit this file to the Particl team,\nsend it to Tecnovert (@tecnovert:matrix.org) on Riot/Element or to Cryptoguard \neither on Telegram/Riot/Element/Discord or by email at cryptoguard@particl.io.\n\nThank you for participating in this output submission process; it will help the\nteam select the best path forward to re-enable frozen outputs and blacklist\nexploited ones!\n\n> Note: Running Particl Desktop 2.3.6 will automatically update your Particl Core\nnode to the latest version. You shouldn’t need to download the new Particl Core\nversion separately unless you want to collect your outputs without using Particl\nDesktop.\nParticl V3 Progress Report\nWe are happy today to also provide a detailed Particl V3 progress report. This\nlist contains all the recent bug fixes and outstanding items since the last\nParticl V3 progress report.\n\nAdditionally, it can now be announced that any slowdown in the progress of\nParticl V3, as mentioned in the March Project Update, has been duly resolved.\nThe development of Particl V3 is now back at a regular pace.\n\nTo-Do\nA list of remaining fixes to include before Particl V3 can go live on mainnet.\nSome of these items are already fixed but require additional testing while the\nothers are relatively minor, except for the zmq.node issue that occurs for some\nWindows users.\n\n * Once a market is blacklisted, it does not allow for further processing of any\n   related activity. For example, the market cannot be removed, product\n   templates for the market cannot be created, etc. The fix has been implemented\n   and is currently in testing phase.\n * An expired listing item that has been added to the cart is automatically\n   removed from the particl-market but remains added to the cart. The fix has\n   been implemented and is currently in testing phase.\n * A situation can occur during which releasing the escrow without completing\n   the “shipping” step can result in both parties becoming stuck in the\n   “shipping step”. The fix has been implemented and is currently in testing\n   phase.\n * Category filter for general markets other than the default Open Marketplace\n   does not work as expected. The fix has been implemented and is currently in\n   testing phase.\n * The change implemented to fix the category filter requires a change to the\n   implementation of selecting a category during the product template\n   creation/editing.\n * Fix the zmq.node error on startup occurring on some Windows machines.\n * Allow external links listed via the Help and Support page to open in the\n   user's browser instead of inside a self-contained webview \"window\". There are\n   some concerns about this, so this will likely be temporary until a better\n   solution can be implemented.\n * Add dynamic loading screen quotations.\n * There is no means to delete a published product from the Inventory tab.\n * Display the category creation modal or otherwise direct the user to the\n   category creation process after creating a new storefront market.\n * Add additional text to the market creation section to ensure that there is no\n   confusion about the market being private by default and only being known if\n   the market details are explicitly shared with others or the market is\n   promoted.\n\nIn Progress\nA list of items currently being worked on.\n\n * Updating Particl Desktop code in V3 to be compatible with recent API\n   improvements applied in particl-market. Needs some significant testing to\n   ensure all things are working, so takes a non-trivial amount of time to\n   complete.\n * In the wallet module, the Address label is not clearly indicated that it\n   requires additional action (clicking the button) to save the label.\n * Test Particl Core 0.19.2.6 with Particl Desktop 3.0, fixing any issues that\n   may occur.\n\nCompleted\nA list of the items that have been completed since the last Particl V3 progress\nreport.\n\n * Add 32-bit Windows builds back in as before.\n * Setting all shipping costs to 0 causes some errors while publishing a product\n   and purchasing.\n * On the listings page, add a checkbox-like control to each item to avoid\n   confusion about unselecting a selected country.\n * Allow for the transaction ID to be selected/copied in the Transaction table.\n * Ensure the 'Show inactive and archived' checkbox in the Orders pages is\n   checked/enabled by default to prevent orders from seemingly disappearing once\n   they are complete.\n * Fixed an error that appeared when the Particl Desktop application is closed\n   while the marketplace is starting.\n * A menu dropdown with no additional identities for selection now indicates no\n   alternative identities for selection (rather than displaying nothing).\n * Presents a missing \"unlock wallet\" prompt when creating a market with an\n   encrypted wallet/identity.\n * Display an alternative error message when accepting a bid fails due to having\n   insufficient available funds.\n * Swap the position of the public and anon balance values in the Market\n   Overview display.\n * Updated a setting description to describe its intended purpose more\n   accurately.\n\nETA\nDue to the recent inflationary bug, all anon and blind outputs are temporarily\nfrozen. And because the Particl Marketplace works using anon and blind outputs,\nit is not operational until the upcoming hardfork that unfreezes outputs occurs.\n\nFor this reason, a mainnet release of Particl V3 is not possible until the\nhardfork. In the meantime, you can expect one or more testnet releases of\nParticl V3 to properly test all the new bug fixes and improvements made to it\nsince the first testnet release.\n\nIf the mainnet release is entirely ready before the hardfork takes place, the\nteam will start working on additional Particl Desktop deliverables/features in a\nseparate branch which may, or may not, be merged in time for the first V3\nmainnet release. If a feature has been started and is not ready for release when\nthe hardfork takes place, it’ll then be included in a subsequent release.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.
