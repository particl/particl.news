look back at what\nwe've achieved in the past few days and see what we've got to look forward to in\nthe week to come.\n\nNote that last week's progress was slightly slower than usual due to the\nholidays and spending a few days with family and friends. Regular development\npace has now resumed.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nDogecoin Integration ?\nWe are ready to merge the Dogecoin (DOGE) integration into the dev branch for\ncommunity testing, which will occur within the next few hours or during the\nweekend.\n\nDue to Dogecoin's unique codebase, we've developed a custom core package to\nenable integration. We're seeking additional community testers to thoroughly\nevaluate this implementation before its production release. It's important to\nnote that this DOGE integration will be classified as 'experimental' since it\nuses our custom core rather than the official one. This custom version was\nnecessary to implement functions required by BasicSwap that are absent from the\nofficial core.\n\nFurthermore, due to Dogecoin's lack of SegWit support, it will only be available\nas a scriptless coin. This means it cannot be swapped directly with Monero,\nWownero, or other non-scriptable coins. While we're investigating potential\nsolutions to this limitation, implementing the necessary changes may ultimately\ndepend on the Dogecoin development team.\n\nPrivate Offers  ?\nWe're expanding the local reputation system announced in last week's update with\nmore user-friendly features. These include a new tagging system that color-codes\nSMSG ID addresses on the order book and replaces them with user-defined labels\nwhen saved in contacts. We're also developing an improved identity page that\nfunctions more like a contact management system, making identity handling more\nintuitive.\n\nAlso, planning has begun for our network-wide reputation system, which will\nadapt much of the local reputation logic but operate at the node level. While\nimplementing decentralized reputation presents significant challenges, we've\ndesigned an elegant solution. However, it requires additional refinement to\naddress potential vulnerabilities.\n\nThough implementation isn't immediate, this network-wide reputation system\nrepresents one of our next major developments for BasicSwap. We'll provide more\ndetailed information once we begin active development.\n\nMaster Update ✅\nWe're preparing for the next BasicSwap production update, scheduled for release\naround next week. In preparation, we're completing various smaller tasks from\nour development list and will dedicate the next few days to minor bug fixes and\nimprovements.\n\nWatch for an upcoming Particl News blog post that will detail all the new\nfeatures and improvements in this update!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nDogecoin Integration ?\nWe are in the final stages of the DOGE integration, with only a few remaining\nadditions to complete.\n\nWe're still testing the various components of this integration to ensure they\nbehave as expected in all cases, but we are now indeed in the final stage of the\nprocess.\n\nPrivate Offers  ?\nWe're completing development of a new GUI feature that enables private trading\ncapabilities — a functionality that has been available in the back-end for some\ntime but lacked an intuitive user interface.\n\nPrivate Offers (WIP)Private offers are coming to BasicSwap DEX, allowing users\nto publish offers visible only to specifically authorized parties. These offers\nwill appear in the authorized users' order books with a private tag, indicating\ntheir exclusive nature.\n\nThis feature will soon be available in the dev branch, and we'll provide updates\nas development progresses.\"\n\nWebsockets for Live Updates ?\nWe have completed the integration of websockets into BasicSwap, enabling instant\norder book updates rather than relying on timed refreshes.\n\nThis improvement is crucial as we move toward making BasicSwap's order book more\ndynamic and visually similar to centralized exchanges, with buy/sell side splits\nand depth chart functionality.\n\nUser Interface  ?️\nAdditionally, we continue to make progress on following items outlined\npreviously:\n\n * Development of a new \"quick swap\" page\n   [https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-06-12-2024/#quick-swaps-] \n   that allows users to more easily and accurately swap cryptocurrencies\n * Implementing server-side caching for rate and percentage calculations (in\n   progress, experimental)\n * Standardized modal system; replacing JavaScript popups with consistent,\n   global modal components\n * Various other tweaks and improvements\n\nBasicSwap and Particl in the Media ?️\nPrivacy Roundtable w/ Rachel Rose O'Leary ?️\nThis week's Privacy Roundtable featured a special discussion with Rachel-Rose\nO'Leary from Lunar Punk, joined by our friends from PIVX and Firo. If you missed\nthe live broadcast, you can watch the full episode at the link below.\n\nx.comX (formerly Twitter) [https://x.com/firoorg/status/1869380929896194489]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nMulti-Net Support ?\nMultinet by tecnovert · Pull Request #311 · basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
