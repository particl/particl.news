112 commits coming from 6 different contributors\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/compare/v0.14.1...v0.14.2], we are\nexcited to announce the release of BasicSwap version 0.14.2, along with an\nupdate to its user interface, now at version 3.1.\n\nThis substantial update represents weeks of dedicated effort, incorporating\nnumerous improvements, bug fixes, and new features. The changes stem from\nextensive testing by both contributors and community members, resulting in a\nsignificant step forward for user experience and platform stability.\n\nThis update welcomes Bitcoin Cash and implements several key improvements across\nall aspects of the platform, including changes to the codebase, the user\ninterface, and to individual coin integrations such as Monero.\n\nNotably, a key technical change is the complete replacement of SQLAlchemy with\nmanbearpigSQL, our custom-built hybrid database system. This transition\nsimplifies BasicSwap's data management processes while solidifying security by\neliminating potential vulnerabilities.\n\nWe extend special thanks to Ofrnxmr, Mbacoinin, and mainnet_pat for their code\ncontributions this month, as well as to our dedicated community members who have\nhelped identify bugs and areas for improvement through thorough testing and\nfeedback. This update would not have been possible without their valuable\nefforts and support!\n\nFor a comprehensive list of all changes, please refer to the final section of\nthis blog post.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInstall the Latest BasicSwap Update ?️\n\nTo install the new update, which includes both the codebase and user interface\nupdates, simply update BasicSwap through the usual process\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html] \n(video walkthrough [https://youtu.be/kk3FtE_TKBQ]) and launch the DEX again.\n\nDocker\n> If you've installed BasicSwap following the Docker method...\n * Shutdown BasicSwap properly and stop the Docker image (docker-compose stop),\n * From the basicswap folder, type the git pull command,\n * In the /docker folder, run the docker-compose build --no-cache command,\n * Once the process completes, launch BasicSwap again using the docker-compose\n   up command.\n\nNon-Docker\n> If you've installed BasicSwap follow the non-Docker method...\n * Shutdown BasicSwap properly,\n * From the ~/coinswaps/basicswap folder, type the git pull command,\n * Execute the following command: pip install --require-hashes -r\n   requirements.txt,\n * Execute the following command: pip3 install .,\n * Launch BasicSwap as usual.\n\nInstall Script\n> If you've installed BasicSwap using Nahuhh's Github installation script\n[https://github.com/nahuhh/basicswap-bash/]...\n * Execute the update command twice: bsx-update && bsx-update.\n\nChangelog ?\nNew Coins\n * Bitcoin Cash (BCH)\n\nAPI\n * Rates and prices are now updated in one single API call instead of one call\n   per coin\n * Fixed Bitcoin Cash (BCH) market rate calculation via API\n * Added set_max_concurrent_bids helper\n * Optionally display events with states\n\nUI Code\n * Refactored the javascript code of the Offers page\n * Refactored the javascript code of the Wallets page\n\nUI\n * The new offer page remembers the last SMSG address used\n * Added a modal to review and confirm a bid's parameters before submitting\n * When publishing an offer on the public order book, rate variable is forced to\n   false\n * When publishing an offer on the public order book, amount variable is forced\n   to true\n * When publish an offer on the public order book, auto-accept is forced to true\n * Fixed various issues with Wownero chart and rates\n * Added a smart refresh button to offers table\n * Fixed caching system for Wallets page\n * Improved the show/hide functionality of the Wallets page (now also applies to\n   cryptocurrencies, not just fiat values)\n * Fixed a UI issue that caused bids to be sent twice\n * Fixed a UI issue that caused connection reset problems\n * Fixed caching system for order book\n * Added better filtering functionality to order book tables\n * Order book and price charts caching system now set to 5 minutes\n * After successfully placing a bid, the user is now automatically redirected to\n   the bid page\n * Order book filters now include \"Revoked\" and \"Expired\"\n * Fixed a bug that prevented a deposit address to be properly copied\n * Allow js_offers limit to be set above PAGE_LIMIT\n * Correct date now on displayed chart\n * Wallet blocks and depth requirements now displayed in Wallets page\n\nCore Functionality\n * basicswap-prepare script forces version to respect withcoins\n * basicswap-prepare script now applies disablecoin/addcoin for\n   manage_wallet_daemon\n * basicswap-prepare script doesn't start daemon if coin config exists in\n   basicswap.json anymore\n * Removed incomplete feature from market making companion script\n * Market making script now parses more than one page of offers\n * Allow startup of XMR wallet with a busy daemon\n * Improve XMR startup speed and remove extra wallet open and refresh processes\n * Improve XMR state saving\n * Fixed the functionality that checks for expired offers\n * Set state for expired reverse bids\n * Vastly improved the auto-accept functionality (eliminates a wide variety of\n   possible errors and failures)\n * Fixed the functionality that checks for Particl balances across different\n   states\n * Adjust wallet names for Particl anon and Particl blind interfaces\n * getUnspentByAddr now correctly retrieves unspent Particl blind UTXOs\n * Add debugind to prevent spending coin A lock transaction\n * Fixed unbound error when no wallet data is cached\n * Bypass .local domains when Tor is enabled\n * Reformat entire codebase according to \"Black\" standard (code aesthetic and\n   format standardization.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News.
