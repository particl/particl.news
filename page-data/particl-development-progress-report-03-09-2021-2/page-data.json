All the\nissues highlighted in the progress reports dating from the last testnet client\nup until now have been resolved. One more time, we're asking for your help in\ntesting the new client and trying to find any potential issue. \n\nMore specifically, here are our current areas of interest in regards to this\nspecific testnet round.\n\n 1. Test and verify that any previously mentioned issue is effectively resolved.\n 2. Test the disabling of cold staking from the module and determine whether a\n    previous issue is still present or not. In the previous codebase (\"Particl\n    V2\"), it used to cause problems in some rare cases, but we haven't been able\n    to reproduce it yet on our end. It may, or may not, still be present in\n    Particl V3.\n\nWe are targeting the next 72 hours for the release of the new testnet version of\nParticl V3. So stay tuned for when the news drop on Particl News and the other\nusual communication channels.\n\nParticl Core Development Report\nAside from the usual merging, core developer Tecnovert has resumed working on\nParticl's upcoming BasicSwap decentralized exchange protocol.\n\nAn update to the swapping protocol has gone live and is in the process of being\ntested by participants of the closed beta group.\n\nWhile we haven't made a ton of details on BasicSwap available yet, you can\nexpect that to change soon.\n\nWe'll be publishing more information on the application, how it works, how we\nplan to integrate it into the Particl ecosystem, and what's the longer-term\nvision we have planned for it shortly after the release of Particl V3 on\nmainnet. Additionally, you'll be able to test it out for yourself once we\ninitiate the open beta phase around the same time.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet's all test out the new testnet version of Particl V3 and ensure that it is\nfinally ready for mainnet. Once that is done, we'll be ready to blast forward\ninto the project's next phase and release our new and exciting roadmap.\n\nAs always, thank you immensely for your support and patience.

This list is not exhaustive, it does not\ninclude some of the smaller and/or less impactful fixes.\n\nGovernance Module\n * Enable the governance module for testing.\n * Fixed an issue where graphs were not displaying in release builds.\n\nMarket Module\n * Publishing fee estimates now correctly include the image fees.\n * Filtering for expired listings in Sell > Listings page now works correctly.\n * A warning is now displayed when there may be insufficient utxos (but\n   sufficient total funds) to publish a listing AND all its images. The ability\n   to still continue with the publish is possible, but requires the seller to\n   explicitly indicate that this is acceptable.\n * Updated the csv product import functionality to attempt to match on country\n   name (English only for now) instead of just the ISO code.\n * The csv product import now allows for specifying the \"shipping to\"\n   destinations countries in a comma separated list.\n * The market summary text of a market shown in the Joined Markets section is\n   now selectable.\n * Includes changes made to particl-marketplace service such as...\n * Fixed an error that prevented a bid from being placed if all the images of\n   the item in question had not been properly received.\n * Fixed an error that caused the buyflow to become stuck due to the buyer\n   cancelling the purchase arrangement but the seller completing the escrow\n   state prior to receiving the cancellation action.\n * The particl-marketplace service now has some time on termination to attempt\n   to gracefully shut itself down, instead of terminating processing immediately\n   (and potentially causing issues with the processing of messages).\n * Remove the lookup for an existing \"market\" named wallet to create the initial\n   profile/identity wallets from when initializing the service for the first\n   time: this potentially causes errors and requires manual user intervention if\n   the named \"market\" wallet is encrypted and locked during the service\n   initialization.\n\nWallet Module\n * Updated the zap functionality (cold staking) to cater to additional user\n   options.\n * Changed wording on the transaction table entries to make more sense when fees\n   are involved: this includes fees paid for smsg fees (eg: publishing listings\n   via smsg) and zap transaction fees.\n * The restore wallet flow now caters to 12 word mnemonic inputs.\n\nGeneral\n * Added additional messages to message of the day.\n * Spelling and other grammar updates.\n * Update and unify usage of the zmq library dependency.\n * Application crashes should now be handled correctly: instead of receiving a\n   nasty JS error prompt, the error is logged and a friendlier window is\n   displayed indicating that the application has crashed. This is a temporary\n   stopgap change that leads into better logging and user visibility into what\n   the application is doing.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you for your support and assistance in testing this new version of Particl\nV3.

Although\nwe didn't get a new Particl V3 testnet build this week, we've got a great update\nto communicate.\n\nThe star of the show this week is the ZMQ issue. Last week, we announced an\ninterim solution that would allow us to release Particl V3 on mainnet with\nminimal compromise. In a last ditch effort to fix the issue before the next\ntestnet round, core developer Tecnovert joined forces with desktop developer\nArnold Bansemer to find a permanent solution. We are very happy to announce that\nthe long-standing ZMQ issue is now permanently fixed with a unified solution\nacross all operating systems! An interim solution is not needed anymore.\n\n> \"I think its really important to mention Tecnovert's troubleshooting and\nassistance here in getting this done!! A massive thank you needs to be said to\nhim for the assistance with that whole mess!\" - Arnold Bansemer\nAside from this issue, a good number of minor issues were also fixed this week.\nThis includes the governance module's graph not properly displaying on\nproduction builds, adding more precise GUI messages to better define errors, and\ncleaning up the code in various places.\n\nSo what's left to do now? Let's check it out!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Development Report\nImprove the New Zap Function's Integration\nThe new zap function has been integrated into Particl Desktop but we've found a\nfew areas of improvements. Notably, the process of zapping now operates \"in the\nbackground\". For this reason, it needs to be able complete its task even while a\nuser navigates to a different module than the wallet (i.e., marketplace module).\n\nThis is a relatively minor task that should be completed quickly. \n\nBuild and Release the New (and Hopefully Last) Testnet Round\nOnce the above item will be completed, all that will remain will be to build the\nnew testnet version, test it internally, and then release it for one more round\nof public testing. Although we planned on releasing it a bit earlier, the\nbreakthrough made with the ZMQ issue has moved it to a few more days in the\nfuture. \n\nAs always, we don't have a precise ETA, but as you can see from this development\nprogress report, it's about ready!\n\nParticl Core Development Report\nOn top of helping with the ZMQ issue for the most part of the week, Particl's\ncode developer Tecnovert has merged various updates from Bitcoin into the\nParticl Core, as is usual. This is an ever-ongoing task.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs we near a new (and hopefully last) round of public testing for Particl V3, we\nwant to once again thank you all for your incredible support for this project\nand passion for what it stands for!

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nMulti-Net Support ?\nMultinet by tecnovert · Pull Request #311 · basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
