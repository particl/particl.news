This release has been a historic moment for the project and\na huge stepping stone for the upcoming eCommerce revolution that Particl is\nbrewing up.\n\nParticl’s Open Marketplace Live on Mainnet ?Since that time, the team has\ncertainly not been taking it slow. No, it’s instead been carefully monitoring\nthe community for feedback and comments regarding the overall user experience of\nthis first live version of the marketplace and has started working on several\nfeatures that are soon going to make their way onto the marketplace. It’s\nimportant to remind ourselves that this version of the Open Marketplace is an\nearly Beta version and is in no way the “end” of anything for Particl. Quite to\nthe contrary, it is the beginning of a great journey in disrupting one of the\nbiggest economic sector of the world— the eCommerce sector.\n\nIt’s been mentioned in the past that, as the Open Marketplace goes live on\nmainnet, it would signify a gradual change of phase for the project. Whereas\nParticl used to be almost exclusively focused on development, getting a live\nproduct means user adoption will now play a more important role. After all, this\nproject has always been about building a product that people could use to\naddress real-world issues. It has always been about creating a solution that\nempowers individuals and enables businesses to reach their full potential. And\nnow that the solution is here, it’s time to get people to use it and benefit\nfrom its groundbreaking technology.\n\nNow it’s Adoption Time!\nEver since the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace, the Particl team has\nreceived a huge amount of feedback and comments about the overall user\nexperience. And it is this user experience, the feeling you get when using the\nmarketplace, that is critical in getting new people and businesses to use\nParticl. It is one of the key factors in determining the “user conversion rate”,\nor the number of people that become recurring users after trying out the\nmarketplace for the first time.\n\nIndeed, getting new people to try out the marketplace is one thing, but\nretaining them as users is a whole other story. Most of the time, people are\nmore than willing to sacrifice their data and even pay higher prices if the user\nexperience is better elsewhere. And besides, you also get one chance at first\nimpressions.\n\nFor this reason, the new Open Marketplace development roadmap will now be\nheavily focused on building what needs to be done to make the user experience as\ngood and as accessible as possible. In other words, each new marketplace feature\nreleased within the next few weeks and months will directly contribute in making\nthe user experience better, thus increasing the user conversion rate and\nallowing more sellers and buyers to be onboarded.\n\nWhat are the Current Barriers to Entry\nSince the ultimate goal of the Open Marketplace is to empower individuals and\nbusinesses on a global scale, it’s important to identify what are the current\nbarriers to entry for anyone to start using the marketplace. After that, it’s\ncrucial to identify what can be done about it and then act on it.\n\nBy definition, a barrier to entry is an obstacle or hindrance that makes it hard\nto adopt a new product. This obstacle can be a technological challenge,\ndifficult government regulations, a steep financial cost, a lack of education\nabout a topic, and etc. In the Open Marketplace’s case, the barriers to entry\nare mostly technological, financial, and educational.\n\nThat much is made quite obvious when you start to go over the list of the most\nreported issues, comments, and feedback regarding the user experience of the\nmarketplace since it’s been released on mainnet. When all summarized, most of it\ncan be boiled down to a few main barriers to entry that makes it a bit\nchallenging for buyers and sellers to adopt the platform. Some of the most\nreported user experience issues include:\n\n * The setup process of the marketplace (it has to be manually enabled) could be\n   improved (technological barrier)\n * Listing fees being too high for large-scale sellers (financial barrier)\n * The double deposit MAD escrow requires a security deposit from both sides \n   (financial barrier)\n * There is no branding or identification option for vendors (technological\n   barrier)\n * The marketplace currently only accepts the PART coin and not Bitcoin, other\n   cryptocurrencies, or more traditional means of payment (technological\n   barrier)\n * The entire blockchain and SMSG network needs to be synced, which takes a few\n   minutes to do (technological barrier)\n * What needs to be done to complete a certain action isn’t always perfectly\n   clear (educational barrier)\n * How funds move throughout a full transaction process (educational barrier)\n\nThese barriers to entry are the main obstacles that make it harder for Particl\nto be adopted to a wider level. As such, solutions to these issues will be\nprioritized moving forward, and each item contained within the Open Marketplace\ndevelopment roadmap for the next few months is designed to increase the adoption\nof the Open Marketplace by improving the user experience.\n\nMake Particl as Accessible as Any Other Marketplace\nTo eliminate the barriers that make the Open Marketplace hard to adopt for most\npeople, the Particl team has planned and started working on several improvements\nand features. Each of them is designed to feed off each other and directly\ncontribute to improving Particl’s user experience for both buyers and sellers.\n\nWhat follows is an estimated release timeline of the next few features that are\ngoing to make their way onto Particl’s Open Marketplace. There’s currently no\ndate or time estimate associated with any of these features, but they’re what’s\nbeing worked on at this moment and what is planned to be released in the short\nto mid-term.\n\n> Note: This development timeline is only an estimation of the order at which\nfeatures will be released live on mainnet. All listed items are subject to\nchange.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Coming Up for Particl?\n * User Interface Tweaks\n * Lowering Marketplace Fees\n * Product Import Tool (1)\n * Q&A Section — Ask a Question to a Seller (2)\n * Particl Desktop Settings Page (3)\n * Market Management Tool (4)\n * Adjustable Escrow Ratio (5)\n * Inventory and Quantity Management Tool (6)\n * Then What?\n   Alternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments\n   Mobile Application\n   Developer SDK Tools\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUser Interface Tweaks\nImproved Sell Orders Page (Work-in-Progress)The lowest hanging fruit for\nimpoving Particl’s user experience is by making several tweaks to the user\ninterface of Particl Desktop, the client on which the Open Marketplace is\nhosted. These tweaks are currently being worked on based on user feedback and\nwill make using Particl much easier, especially for those who haven’t used it in\nthe past. These improvements and additions will also display more information to\nbuyers and sellers, making it easier to track what’s happening within the client\n(i.e. why funds are moving around, or at what time has a certain transaction\nbeen locked into escrow, and etc).\n\nLowering Marketplace Fees\nOne of the most reported issue with the Open Marketplace is the cost of listing\nan item. As the marketplace is fully autonomous and isn’t being operated by any\nthird-party, it charges no commission, subscription, payment processing, or\nescrow fee at all. It does, however, charge a small listing fee to fight off\nspam on the network.\n\nIn fact, when listing an item, the network usually charges sellers with a few\ncents worth of PART every day. And while it isn’t that big of a deal for any\nseller making a few sales here and there on their listings, especially given the\nfact that no commission is being charged on top of sales, it can quickly add up\nfor some of the smaller scale vendors who struggle to make sales and sellers\nwith huge inventories (hundreds/thousands of listings).\n\nAdjusting Marketplace Listing Fees on the Partyman AppFortunately, you can\nactually contribute to making this listing fee smaller. The Particl team has\npublished on their blog a full tutorial\n[https://particl.news/adjusting-listing-fees-4b676e230601] on how to instruct\nyour staking node to broadcast a request for lower fees to the SMSG network.\nSMSG is the network on which marketplace-related content is published and\nhosted.\n\nAdditionally, the Particl team is in the process of improving and optimizing the\nSMSG network. It is estimated that the marketplace fees (i.e. listing fees) will\nsignificantly be lowered due to the more effective SMSG codebase.\n\nThese changes will come gradually within the Beta phase of development of the\nmarketplace as updates get pushed.\n\nProduct Import Tool\nProduct Import Tool (Work-in-Progress)One of the key components of a two-sided\nmarketplace is getting a good amount of sellers and listed products. This is why\nthe new Particl Open Marketplace roadmap for the next few months includes a lot\nof tools that will make it easier for sellers to adopt the platform.\n\nOne such tool is the Product Import tool. This tool allows vendors to quickly\nimport large inventories from other sources, considerably reducing the time it\ntakes to populate the marketplace when holding custody of large inventories.\nWithout this feature, sellers need to manually add listings one by one, which is\na very time-consuming process.\n\nWith this feature in place, sellers are going to be able to import and list\nlarge inventories with only a few clicks. Outside sources for inventory\nimportation will include WooCommerce stores and CSV files (spreadsheets). More\noptions are very likely to be added in the future.\n\nQ&A Section — Ask a Question to a Seller\nBut a two-sided marketplace being a two-sided marketplace, it also needs a good\namount of buyers so that it can reach its full potential. This is where the\nupcoming Q&A section comes into play.\n\nThis “comment section” will allow anyone to ask questions to vendors before\npurchasing (or flagging) a product. This isn’t unlike the very popular Q&A\nsection that Amazon has had for some time now, and it goes a great way into\ngiving you information that might be missing from the item’s description.\n\nThis feature, while not a direct line of contact with the seller, will help\nbuyers make more informed purchasing decisions and give a little bit more\nconfidence when buying an item from a complete stranger. The more you know, the\nbetter decisions one can make.\n\nParticl Desktop Settings Page\nThe Particl Desktop Settings page is a no-brainer. Currently, if you want to\nchange a configuration on your Particl Desktop client, you either have to modify\nsome config file or enter some command inside the console. This works, but since\nthe goal is to make Particl’s user experience as good as possible, it’s\ndefinitely not as user-friendly as it should be.\n\nThe Settings page is pretty much what you would expect from a…settings page. It\nallows you to change various preferences without having to go through the hassle\nof finding a tutorial on how to find and modify a config file, or find a list of\ncommands to enter in the console.\n\nMarket Management Tool\nThe Market Management tool is one of the most awaited features of the Open\nMarketplace, and rightly so. It is what’s going to make all the individual\npieces of the marketplace click together and form into a giant distributed\nnetwork of markets.\n\nSelect What Market (or Storefront) to Browse (Work-in-Progress)Market Management\nwill allow you to either create a market of your own or connect your client to a\npre-existing one. These community markets can be created by anyone and are\ncompletely independent of the main interface of the Open Marketplace. In fact,\nthey are powered by completely different sets of market keys, meaning no data\ncan be shared between the different markets. It’s like multi-wallets, but more\nadvanced and for markets.\n\nOn Particl, there are two types of markets: community markets, and storefronts.\n\nCommunity Markets: They are markets on which anyone that has access to it can\nbuy or sell goods and services. They function exactly the same as the main\ninterface of the Open Marketplace, and nobody has any special permission over\nother users. Not even the market creator. These markets, however, are not\nenabled nor visible by default. To access these markets, you need to connect\nyour Particl Desktop client to its Market ID.\n\n> Note: The main interface of the Open Marketplace is a community market that’s\nenabled and displayed by default by the Particl Desktop client.\nJoined Markets (and Storefronts) Page (Work-in-Progress)Storefronts: They are customizable community markets on which special\npermissions can be attributed to various users. In their most common sense, they\nare storefronts on which a seller can “set up a shop” in such a way that only\nhim (or the people he gives administrator rights to) can publish listings.\nAnyone with access to a storefront can only buy (or flag) the listings put on\nthere by the owner of the storefront. Storefronts can also be used by\ncommunities looking for higher standards in quality on which only vetted sellers\ncould publish listings.\n\n> Note: By default, Particl Desktop has no way to automatically find Market IDs on\nthe network. These keys need to be distributed manually by whoever wants people\nto interact with a certain market or storefront…unless these markets/storefronts\nget promoted.\nPromote a Market or Storefront (Work-in-Progress)While Particl Desktop cannot\nautomatically scan and detect community markets, it is still possible to promote\nyour market to the network, for a fee. When “promoting” your market (or\nstorefront), your Particl Desktop client broadcasts the Market ID of your market\nto the network using SMSG. It is then picked up by the other clients connected\nto the Particl network, and is added to a “market browser”. At this point, a\nmarket will act just like a listing. It will show up on the market browser for\nthe amount of time it’s been promoted. Once the promotion period ends, the\nmarket disappears from the market browser.\n\n> Note: Once a market or storefront disappears from the market browser, it is\nstill accessible to anyone with its Market ID. The only difference is that it\nwon’t be publicly accessible from the market browser itself.\nAnyone with the proper Market IDs of a market or storefront can promote it. All\nthe fees paid to bump/promote community markets are, just like the listing fees,\nredistributed to stakers.\n\nCreate a New Storefront With Logo (Work-in-Progress)Storefronts are ideal for\nsellers with an already established reputation. It allows them to guarantee to\ntheir customer base that a given market, thus all products published inside of\nit, belongs to him. This can easily be done by, for example, displaying the\nMarket ID of the storefront on the seller’s official website.\n\nAdditionally, storefronts allow for a minimal amount of customization/branding\n(logo, store description, store title) and aggregate all the listings of a\nvendor to a single point of access This makes it easier and quicker for\ncustomers to find what they’re looking for, when they need it.\n\nAdjustable Escrow Ratio\nAs it stands right now, Particl’s double deposit MAD escrow system only works\nusing a 100% ratio, meaning both parties need to deposit a security deposit\nequal to 100% of the value of the item or service being purchased. There’s\nnothing wrong with that, of course. After all, a 100% ratio does provide the\nbest game-theory for this type of escrow. There might, however, be some\ncircumstances where such an escrow system wouldn’t be ideal.\n\nTake the example of a well-known seller that’s already trusted by its customer\nbase and runs a storefront on Particl. This seller might want to move some of\nits inventory on Particl to save on fees and improve the level of privacy for\nhis business as well as his customers. But since that seller is already\nwell-known and has an established customer base, it might not be ideal for both\nthe seller and its customer to front funds in order to cover a double deposit\nMAD escrow smart-contract. There is already trust that’s been established\nbetween the two parties and, since the seller is running a Particl storefront,\nhe can prove ownership of the products being offered simply by spreading his\nMarket ID on his website or social media pages. In that situation, the required\nsecurity deposits become an unnecessary obstacle for both the seller and the\nbuyer as they do not necessarily require, or want, escrow protection for\ntransactions.\n\nWhat an adjustable escrow would mean is that vendors could set up their own\nescrow ratio preferences from 0% to 100%. In the above example of a well-known\nseller running a Particl storefront, he could just reduce his escrow ratio to\n0%, meaning no security deposit would be required from neither the buyer or the\nvendor. This, of course, means that buyers would have no recourse against a\ndishonest seller, but for those already-established sellers with an existing\ncustomer base, having the opportunity to not have to advance coins to fund the\nescrow system would make adopting Particl’s Open Marketplace much more of a\nno-brainer.\n\nInventory and Quantity Management Tool\nThis feature is self-explanatory. There is no way, currently, to manage a wide\ninventory and add quantities to your listing. Fortunately, the marketplace\nback-end currently allows for most of it, but it hasn’t been integrated into the\nOpen Marketplace just yet. Note that a relatively fair amount of development is\nstill needed around this feature and it is likely to be released after the\nMarket Management tool.\n\nThis tool, like its name implies, allows vendors to easily manage inventory\nquantities, manage multiple listings, and etc. Just like the Product Import\ntool, Inventory Management is going to make it way easier for sellers with large\ninventories to take the leap and get started selling on Particl without it being\na big hassle.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThen What?\nAll of the above-mentioned items are placed into a short to mid-term roadmap,\nmeaning they are likely to be released within the next few weeks and months,\ndepending on the feature. But wait, there’s more to it!\n\nThe Particl team is thinking ahead and has already planned and started doing\nresearch on the features that are going to be worked on once the above\nmarketplace development roadmap is completed.\n\nAlternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments\nOne of the barriers to entry for Particl’s Open Marketplace currently is that it\nonly works with PART, Particl’s native privacy coin. This, of course, is due to\nthe nature of the technology and how the marketplace has to use PART for its\nprivacy and smart-contract capabilities\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd]. If it\nwere using Bitcoin, not only would transactions take a considerably longer time\ndue to longer confirmations, but the marketplace wouldn’t be able to offer a\nprivate-by-default experience to its users. And if it were using Monero, it\nwould be okay on the privacy side of things, but then the coin couldn’t be used\nwithin smart-contracts. The PART coin is a next-generation privacy coin that\nhas\nboth a solid privacy scheme and a flexible codebase\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd] which\nallows it to be used within smart-contracts. As far as privacy coins come, it’s\npretty much getting your cake and eating it too! The good stuff…without the\nlimitations.\n\nBut in the end, people want an easy-to-use marketplace with good user\nexperience, and only accepting PART severely limits the number of new users that\ncan be onboarded (that’s because everybody uses Bitcoin, mostly). To address\nthis issue, the Particl team is going to be working on integrating alternative\nmethods of payments, like paying with Bitcoin, for example.\n\nThere are a couple of ways this can be done, either through an atomic swap\nwidget or by integrating a third-party partner. And while the Particl team would\nlike to use an atomic swap solution (research and development on the matter is\nongoing at this very moment), a third-party integration might have to be coded\nin until an atomic swap application is fully ready (and thoroughly tested) to\ngo. There are currently investigations going into this question specifically,\nand so more details will be able to be communicated in the future.\n\nIt’s important to note though that, regardless of the method chosen to accept\ndifferent payment methods, the PART coin will always be the coin that settles\nthe transaction in the end. That’s because even though Particl’s Open\nMarketplace would be accepting Bitcoin, the marketplace Dapp still needs PART to\noperate as it is the coin that gives it its privacy and smart-contract\ncapabilities. This means any non-PART payments will be automatically converted\ninto a PART transaction, in the background, on behalf of the user. The end\nresult is that the buyer pays with Bitcoin, and the Open Marketplace does all\nthe rest, transferring the Bitcoin into Particl to fuel the escrow contract.\n\nMobile Application\nAnother very important upcoming feature is a Particl Open Marketplace mobile\napplication. Indeed, most people now shop on their cellphones, which means\ndownloading a software that requires you to sync two networks (blockchain +\nSMSG) is definitely a downgrade in terms of user experience. Sure, it provides\nway better privacy and decentralization, but for most people, this is too weak\nof an argument against a lazy and fast user-experience.\n\nAnd so, to address this issue, the Particl team has scheduled the development of\na mobile application. Research is already being put into this item at this very\nmoment, although it is not a top priority for the team right now. That’s because\nthere are still some core features missing to the marketplace (the items in the\nabove roadmap) that need to be added before the team can think of wrapping\neverything within a mobile application. Once the above roadmap is complete or\nnear-complete, that’s when the Open Marketplace’s mobile application is going to\nbecome more of a focus.\n\nThis mobile application will make Particl as accessible as it will have ever\nbeen. In fact, most of the world uses cellphones and more and more people now\nspend more time on their phone than on their computer. To make sure the\napplication has good performance and setup speed, it is more than likely to be a\n“light wallet”, meaning it won’t require you to download the entire blockchain\nand SMSG network to function. In other words, this application is intended to be\nas easy to use as any traditional marketplace mobile application (i.e. Amazon’s\napplication).\n\nDeveloper SDK Tools\nWith bringing more people within the Particl ecosystem in mind, the team has\nplanned for the release of an SDK tool. This tool will be accompanied by various\ntechnical documentation that is now currently missing. This will allow outside\ndevelopers and teams to easily start contributing to the Particl network by\ndeveloping services, decentralized applications, marketplace features, and etc.\n\nBecause the Open Marketplace is still very much into a heavy development phase,\nthis SDK tool is likely to be one of the last items of this article to see the\nday. With this in mind, the SDK tool will be going live once the Particl code\ngets “stable enough” so that it makes sense to commit to a version and write\ndocumentation on it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet’s Wrap it Up\nAll of the above-mentioned features that are going to be added to Particl have\none thing in common — they are part of a bigger puzzle that’s gonna make the\nOpen Marketplace much more accessible and easy to use for everyone. They all\ncontribute to eliminate the current barriers to entry that makes adopting\nParticl more complicated for most people.\n\nOnce in place, these should take Particl to the next level, making it a much\nmore credible contender for mainstream adoption. In the meantime, Particl\npioneers such as you can still buy and sell anything for crypto, without leaving\na trace, using the current version of the Open Marketplace. And since the\nmarketplace is now live on mainnet, new features and improvements can be\nexpected to come out at an accelerated pace!\n\nParticl is now well on its way on the path towards mainstream adoption. The\ndevelopment team is now a well-oiled machine and is excited to enter this new\nphase for the Particl project. The base layer is there, now it’s all about\nputting the last pieces to the puzzle together. This is where it gets exciting\nand when it starts moving faster!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-r41YvsRXOJyeVDkN_GcTqg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"new-marketplace-development-update-roadmap\">New Marketplace Development Update &amp; Roadmap</h3><p>It has now been more than 2 weeks since the Particl Open Marketplace has launched on mainnet. This release has been a historic moment for the project and a huge stepping stone for the upcoming eCommerce revolution that Particl is brewing up.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-QjorfnMkAgAxEXVbGdPndw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl’s Open Marketplace Live on Mainnet ?</figcaption></figure><p>Since that time, the team has certainly not been taking it slow. No, it’s instead been carefully monitoring the community for feedback and comments regarding the overall user experience of this first live version of the marketplace and has started working on several features that are soon going to make their way onto the marketplace. It’s important to remind ourselves that this version of the Open Marketplace is an early Beta version and is in no way the “end” of anything for Particl. Quite to the contrary, it is the beginning of a great journey in disrupting one of the biggest economic sector of the world— the eCommerce sector.</p><p>It’s been mentioned in the past that, as the Open Marketplace goes live on mainnet, it would signify a gradual change of phase for the project. Whereas Particl used to be almost exclusively focused on development, getting a live product means user adoption will now play a more important role. After all, this project has always been about building a product that people could use to address <strong>real-world issues. </strong>It has always been about creating a solution that empowers individuals and enables businesses to reach their full potential. And now that the solution is here, it’s time to get people to use it and benefit from its groundbreaking technology.</p><h2 id=\"now-it-s-adoption-time-\">Now it’s Adoption Time!</h2><p>Ever since the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace, the Particl team has received a huge amount of feedback and comments about the overall user experience. And it is this user experience, the feeling you get when using the marketplace, that is critical in getting new people and businesses to use Particl. It is one of the key factors in determining the “user conversion rate”, or the number of people that become recurring users after trying out the marketplace for the first time.</p><p>Indeed, getting new people to try out the marketplace is one thing, but retaining them as users is a whole other story. Most of the time, people are more than willing to sacrifice their data and even pay higher prices if the user experience is better elsewhere. And besides, you also get one chance at first impressions.</p><p>For this reason, <strong>the new Open Marketplace development roadmap will now be heavily focused on building what needs to be done to make the user experience as good and as accessible as possible. </strong>In other words, each new marketplace feature released within the next few weeks and months will directly contribute in making the user experience better, thus increasing the user conversion rate and allowing more sellers and buyers to be onboarded.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-current-barriers-to-entry\">What are the Current Barriers to Entry</h2><p>Since the ultimate goal of the Open Marketplace is to empower individuals and businesses on a global scale, it’s important to identify what are the current barriers to entry for anyone to start using the marketplace. After that, it’s crucial to identify what can be done about it and then act on it.</p><p>By definition, a barrier to entry is an obstacle or hindrance that makes it hard to adopt a new product. This obstacle can be a technological challenge, difficult government regulations, a steep financial cost, a lack of education about a topic, and etc. In the Open Marketplace’s case, the barriers to entry are mostly <strong>technological</strong>, <strong>financial</strong>, and<strong> educational</strong>.</p><p>That much is made quite obvious when you start to go over the list of the most reported issues, comments, and feedback regarding the user experience of the marketplace since it’s been released on mainnet. When all summarized, most of it can be boiled down to a few main barriers to entry that makes it a bit challenging for buyers and sellers to adopt the platform. Some of the most reported user experience issues include:</p><ul><li>The setup process of the marketplace (it has to be manually enabled) could be improved <strong>(technological barrier)</strong></li><li>Listing fees being too high for large-scale sellers <strong>(financial barrier)</strong></li><li>The double deposit MAD escrow requires a security deposit from both sides <strong>(financial barrier)</strong></li><li>There is no branding or identification option for vendors <strong>(technological barrier)</strong></li><li>The marketplace currently only accepts the PART coin and not Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, or more traditional means of payment <strong>(technological barrier)</strong></li><li>The entire blockchain and SMSG network needs to be synced, which takes a few minutes to do<strong> (technological barrier)</strong></li><li>What needs to be done to complete a certain action isn’t always perfectly clear <strong>(educational barrier)</strong></li><li>How funds move throughout a full transaction process <strong>(educational barrier)</strong></li></ul><p>These barriers to entry are the main obstacles that make it harder for Particl to be adopted to a wider level. As such, solutions to these issues will be prioritized moving forward, and each item contained within the Open Marketplace development roadmap for the next few months is designed to increase the adoption of the Open Marketplace by improving the user experience.</p><h2 id=\"make-particl-as-accessible-as-any-other-marketplace\">Make Particl as Accessible as Any Other Marketplace</h2><p>To eliminate the barriers that make the Open Marketplace hard to adopt for most people, the Particl team has planned and started working on several improvements and features. Each of them is designed to feed off each other and directly contribute to improving Particl’s user experience for both buyers and sellers.</p><p>What follows is an estimated release timeline of the next few features that are going to make their way onto Particl’s Open Marketplace. There’s currently no date or time estimate associated with any of these features, but they’re what’s being worked on at this moment and what is planned to be released in the short to mid-term.</p><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>This development timeline is only an estimation of the order at which features will be released live on mainnet.

In their most common sense, they are storefronts on which a seller can “set up a shop” in such a way that only him (or the people he gives administrator rights to) can publish listings. Anyone with access to a storefront can only buy (or flag) the listings put on there by the owner of the storefront. Storefronts can also be used by communities looking for higher standards in quality on which only vetted sellers could publish listings.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> By default, Particl Desktop has no way to automatically find Market IDs on the network. These keys need to be distributed manually by whoever wants people to interact with a certain market or storefront…unless these markets/storefronts get promoted.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-xEOnXDjpfjoRMz-Gyasahg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Promote a Market or Storefront (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>While Particl Desktop cannot automatically scan and detect community markets, it is still possible to <strong>promote your market</strong> to the network, for a fee. When “promoting” your market (or storefront), your Particl Desktop client broadcasts the Market ID of your market to the network using SMSG. It is then picked up by the other clients connected to the Particl network, and is added to a “market browser”. At this point, a market will act just like a listing. It will show up on the market browser for the amount of time it’s been promoted. Once the promotion period ends, the market disappears from the market browser.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Once a market or storefront disappears from the market browser, it is still accessible to anyone with its Market ID. The only difference is that it won’t be publicly accessible from the market browser itself.</blockquote><p>Anyone with the proper Market IDs of a market or storefront can promote it. All the fees paid to bump/promote community markets are, just like the listing fees, redistributed to stakers.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-5utZ5LvZNv-3EOxW_ueeow.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Create a New Storefront With Logo (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>Storefronts are ideal for sellers with an already established reputation. It allows them to guarantee to their customer base that a given market, thus all products published inside of it, belongs to him. This can easily be done by, for example, displaying the Market ID of the storefront on the seller’s official website.</p><p>Additionally, storefronts allow for a minimal amount of customization/branding (logo, store description, store title) and aggregate all the listings of a vendor to a single point of access This makes it easier and quicker for customers to find what they’re looking for, when they need it.</p><h3 id=\"adjustable-escrow-ratio\">Adjustable Escrow Ratio</h3><p>As it stands right now, Particl’s double deposit MAD escrow system only works using a 100% ratio, meaning both parties need to deposit a security deposit equal to 100% of the value of the item or service being purchased. There’s nothing wrong with that, of course. After all, a 100% ratio does provide the best game-theory for this type of escrow. There might, however, be some circumstances where such an escrow system wouldn’t be ideal.</p><p>Take the example of a well-known seller that’s already trusted by its customer base and runs a storefront on Particl. This seller might want to move some of its inventory on Particl to save on fees and improve the level of privacy for his business as well as his customers. But since that seller is already well-known and has an established customer base, it might not be ideal for both the seller and its customer to front funds in order to cover a double deposit MAD escrow smart-contract. There is already trust that’s been established between the two parties and, since the seller is running a Particl storefront, he can prove ownership of the products being offered simply by spreading his Market ID on his website or social media pages. In that situation, the required security deposits become an unnecessary obstacle for both the seller and the buyer as they do not necessarily require, or want, escrow protection for transactions.</p><p>What an adjustable escrow would mean is that vendors could set up their own escrow ratio preferences from 0% to 100%. In the above example of a well-known seller running a Particl storefront, he could just reduce his escrow ratio to 0%, meaning no security deposit would be required from neither the buyer or the vendor. This, of course, means that buyers would have no recourse against a dishonest seller, but for those already-established sellers with an existing customer base, having the opportunity to not have to advance coins to fund the escrow system would make adopting Particl’s Open Marketplace much more of a no-brainer.</p><h3 id=\"inventory-and-quantity-management-tool\">Inventory and Quantity Management Tool</h3><p>This feature is self-explanatory. There is no way, currently, to manage a wide inventory and add quantities to your listing. Fortunately, the marketplace back-end currently allows for most of it, but it hasn’t been integrated into the Open Marketplace just yet. Note that a relatively fair amount of development is still needed around this feature and it is likely to be released after the Market Management tool.</p><p>This tool, like its name implies, allows vendors to easily manage inventory quantities, manage multiple listings, and etc. Just like the Product Import tool, Inventory Management is going to make it way easier for sellers with large inventories to take the leap and get started selling on Particl without it being a big hassle.</p><hr><h2 id=\"then-what\"><strong>Then What?</strong></h2><p>All of the above-mentioned items are placed into a short to mid-term roadmap, meaning they are likely to be released within the next few weeks and months, depending on the feature. But wait, there’s more to it!</p><p>The Particl team is thinking ahead and has already planned and started doing research on the features that are going to be worked on once the above marketplace development roadmap is completed.</p><h3 id=\"alternative-payment-options-bitcoin-payments\">Alternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments</h3><p>One of the barriers to entry for Particl’s Open Marketplace currently is that it only works with PART, Particl’s native privacy coin. This, of course, is due to the nature of the technology and how the marketplace has to use <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>PART for its privacy and smart-contract capabilities</strong></a>. If it were using Bitcoin, not only would transactions take a considerably longer time due to longer confirmations, but the marketplace wouldn’t be able to offer a private-by-default experience to its users. And if it were using Monero, it would be okay on the privacy side of things, but then the coin couldn’t be used within smart-contracts. The <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>PART coin is a next-generation privacy coin that has both a solid privacy scheme and a flexible codebase</strong></a> which allows it to be used within smart-contracts. As far as privacy coins come, it’s pretty much getting your cake and eating it too! The good stuff…without the limitations.</p><p>But in the end, people want an easy-to-use marketplace with good user experience, and only accepting PART severely limits the number of new users that can be onboarded (that’s because everybody uses Bitcoin, mostly). To address this issue, the Particl team is going to be working on integrating alternative methods of payments, like paying with Bitcoin, for example.</p><p>There are a couple of ways this can be done, either through an atomic swap widget or by integrating a third-party partner. And while the Particl team would like to use an atomic swap solution (research and development on the matter is ongoing at this very moment), a third-party integration might have to be coded in until an atomic swap application is fully ready (and thoroughly tested) to go. There are currently investigations going into this question specifically, and so more details will be able to be communicated in the future.</p><p>It’s important to note though that, regardless of the method chosen to accept different payment methods, the PART coin will always be the coin that settles the transaction in the end. That’s because even though Particl’s Open Marketplace would be accepting Bitcoin, the marketplace Dapp still needs PART to operate as it is the coin that gives it its privacy and smart-contract capabilities. This means any non-PART payments will be automatically converted into a PART transaction, in the background, on behalf of the user. The end result is that the buyer pays with Bitcoin, and the Open Marketplace does all the rest, transferring the Bitcoin into Particl to fuel the escrow contract.</p><h3 id=\"mobile-application\">Mobile Application</h3><p>Another very important upcoming feature is a Particl Open Marketplace mobile application. Indeed, most people now shop on their cellphones, which means downloading a software that requires you to sync two networks (blockchain + SMSG) is definitely a downgrade in terms of user experience. Sure, it provides way better privacy and decentralization, but for most people, this is too weak of an argument against a lazy and fast user-experience.</p><p>And so, to address this issue, the Particl team has scheduled the development of a mobile application. Research is already being put into this item at this very moment, although it is not a top priority for the team right now. That’s because there are still some core features missing to the marketplace (the items in the above roadmap) that need to be added before the team can think of wrapping everything within a mobile application. Once the above roadmap is complete or near-complete, that’s when the Open Marketplace’s mobile application is going to become more of a focus.</p><p>This mobile application will make Particl as accessible as it will have ever been. In fact, most of the world uses cellphones and more and more people now spend more time on their phone than on their computer. To make sure the application has good performance and setup speed, it is more than likely to be a “light wallet”, meaning it won’t require you to download the entire blockchain and SMSG network to function. In other words, this application is intended to be as easy to use as any traditional marketplace mobile application (i.e. Amazon’s application).</p><h3 id=\"developer-sdk-tools\">Developer SDK Tools</h3><p>With bringing more people within the Particl ecosystem in mind, the team has planned for the release of an SDK tool. This tool will be accompanied by various technical documentation that is now currently missing. This will allow outside developers and teams to easily start contributing to the Particl network by developing services, decentralized applications, marketplace features, and etc.</p><p>Because the Open Marketplace is still very much into a heavy development phase, this SDK tool is likely to be one of the last items of this article to see the day. With this in mind, the SDK tool will be going live once the Particl code gets “stable enough” so that it makes sense to commit to a version and write documentation on it.</p><hr><h2 id=\"let-s-wrap-it-up\">Let’s Wrap it Up</h2><p>All of the above-mentioned features that are going to be added to Particl have one thing in common — they are part of a bigger puzzle that’s gonna make the Open Marketplace much more accessible and easy to use for everyone. They all contribute to eliminate the current barriers to entry that makes adopting Particl more complicated for most people.</p><p>Once in place, these should take Particl to the next level, making it a much more credible contender for mainstream adoption. In the meantime, Particl pioneers such as you can still buy and sell anything for crypto, without leaving a trace, using the current version of the Open Marketplace. And since the marketplace is now live on mainnet, new features and improvements can be expected to come out at an accelerated pace!</p><p>Particl is now well on its way on the path towards mainstream adoption. The development team is now a well-oiled machine and is excited to enter this new phase for the Particl project. The base layer is there, now it’s all about putting the last pieces to the puzzle together. This is where it gets exciting and when it starts moving faster!</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-uAgpsfe9xDDVHe1pF6zJdg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure>","url":"http://localhost:2368/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"994d687a-0700-42af-9230-d514c67d48e9","codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5f7e4ca61a93b603e3f767b2","reading_time":16,"send_email_when_published":false,"email_subject":null,"childHtmlRehype":{"html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-r41YvsRXOJyeVDkN_GcTqg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><h3 id=\"new-marketplace-development-update-roadmap\">New Marketplace Development Update &#x26; Roadmap</h3><p>It has now been more than 2 weeks since the Particl Open Marketplace has launched on mainnet. This release has been a historic moment for the project and a huge stepping stone for the upcoming eCommerce revolution that Particl is brewing up.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-QjorfnMkAgAxEXVbGdPndw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl’s Open Marketplace Live on Mainnet ?</figcaption></figure><p>Since that time, the team has certainly not been taking it slow. No, it’s instead been carefully monitoring the community for feedback and comments regarding the overall user experience of this first live version of the marketplace and has started working on several features that are soon going to make their way onto the marketplace. It’s important to remind ourselves that this version of the Open Marketplace is an early Beta version and is in no way the “end” of anything for Particl. Quite to the contrary, it is the beginning of a great journey in disrupting one of the biggest economic sector of the world— the eCommerce sector.</p><p>It’s been mentioned in the past that, as the Open Marketplace goes live on mainnet, it would signify a gradual change of phase for the project. Whereas Particl used to be almost exclusively focused on development, getting a live product means user adoption will now play a more important role. After all, this project has always been about building a product that people could use to address <strong>real-world issues. </strong>It has always been about creating a solution that empowers individuals and enables businesses to reach their full potential. And now that the solution is here, it’s time to get people to use it and benefit from its groundbreaking technology.</p><h2 id=\"now-it-s-adoption-time-\">Now it’s Adoption Time!</h2><p>Ever since the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace, the Particl team has received a huge amount of feedback and comments about the overall user experience. And it is this user experience, the feeling you get when using the marketplace, that is critical in getting new people and businesses to use Particl. It is one of the key factors in determining the “user conversion rate”, or the number of people that become recurring users after trying out the marketplace for the first time.</p><p>Indeed, getting new people to try out the marketplace is one thing, but retaining them as users is a whole other story. Most of the time, people are more than willing to sacrifice their data and even pay higher prices if the user experience is better elsewhere. And besides, you also get one chance at first impressions.</p><p>For this reason, <strong>the new Open Marketplace development roadmap will now be heavily focused on building what needs to be done to make the user experience as good and as accessible as possible. </strong>In other words, each new marketplace feature released within the next few weeks and months will directly contribute in making the user experience better, thus increasing the user conversion rate and allowing more sellers and buyers to be onboarded.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-current-barriers-to-entry\">What are the Current Barriers to Entry</h2><p>Since the ultimate goal of the Open Marketplace is to empower individuals and businesses on a global scale, it’s important to identify what are the current barriers to entry for anyone to start using the marketplace. After that, it’s crucial to identify what can be done about it and then act on it.</p><p>By definition, a barrier to entry is an obstacle or hindrance that makes it hard to adopt a new product. This obstacle can be a technological challenge, difficult government regulations, a steep financial cost, a lack of education about a topic, and etc. In the Open Marketplace’s case, the barriers to entry are mostly <strong>technological</strong>, <strong>financial</strong>, and<strong> educational</strong>.</p><p>That much is made quite obvious when you start to go over the list of the most reported issues, comments, and feedback regarding the user experience of the marketplace since it’s been released on mainnet. When all summarized, most of it can be boiled down to a few main barriers to entry that makes it a bit challenging for buyers and sellers to adopt the platform. Some of the most reported user experience issues include:</p><ul><li>The setup process of the marketplace (it has to be manually enabled) could be improved <strong>(technological barrier)</strong></li><li>Listing fees being too high for large-scale sellers <strong>(financial barrier)</strong></li><li>The double deposit MAD escrow requires a security deposit from both sides <strong>(financial barrier)</strong></li><li>There is no branding or identification option for vendors <strong>(technological barrier)</strong></li><li>The marketplace currently only accepts the PART coin and not Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, or more traditional means of payment <strong>(technological barrier)</strong></li><li>The entire blockchain and SMSG network needs to be synced, which takes a few minutes to do<strong> (technological barrier)</strong></li><li>What needs to be done to complete a certain action isn’t always perfectly clear <strong>(educational barrier)</strong></li><li>How funds move throughout a full transaction process <strong>(educational barrier)</strong></li></ul><p>These barriers to entry are the main obstacles that make it harder for Particl to be adopted to a wider level. As such, solutions to these issues will be prioritized moving forward, and each item contained within the Open Marketplace development roadmap for the next few months is designed to increase the adoption of the Open Marketplace by improving the user experience.</p><h2 id=\"make-particl-as-accessible-as-any-other-marketplace\">Make Particl as Accessible as Any Other Marketplace</h2><p>To eliminate the barriers that make the Open Marketplace hard to adopt for most people, the Particl team has planned and started working on several improvements and features. Each of them is designed to feed off each other and directly contribute to improving Particl’s user experience for both buyers and sellers.</p><p>What follows is an estimated release timeline of the next few features that are going to make their way onto Particl’s Open Marketplace. There’s currently no date or time estimate associated with any of these features, but they’re what’s being worked on at this moment and what is planned to be released in the short to mid-term.</p><blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>This development timeline is only an estimation of the order at which features will be released live on mainnet. All listed items are subject to change.</blockquote><hr><h3 id=\"what-s-coming-up-for-particl\">What’s Coming Up for Particl?</h3><ul><li><a href=\"#8c5a\"><strong>User Interface Tweaks</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"#5f27\"><strong>Lowering Marketplace Fees</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"#909d\"><strong>Product Import Tool</strong></a><strong> (1)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#3d73\"><strong>Q&#x26;A Section — Ask a Question to a Seller</strong></a><strong> (2)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#c8cb\"><strong>Particl Desktop Settings Page</strong></a><strong> (3)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#7168\"><strong>Market Management Tool</strong></a><strong> (4)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#e90f\"><strong>Adjustable Escrow Ratio</strong></a><strong> (5)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#3d2b\"><strong>Inventory and Quantity Management Tool</strong></a><strong> (6)</strong></li><li><a href=\"#5a71\"><strong>Then What?</strong></a><br><a href=\"#a7e1\">Alternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments</a><br><a href=\"#c75e\">Mobile Application</a><br><a href=\"#9733\">Developer SDK Tools</a></li></ul><hr><h3 id=\"user-interface-tweaks\">User Interface Tweaks</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-ZdZYzwxy3xJGIyMnGSbIwQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Improved Sell Orders Page (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>The lowest hanging fruit for impoving Particl’s user experience is by making several tweaks to the user interface of Particl Desktop, the client on which the Open Marketplace is hosted. These tweaks are currently being worked on based on user feedback and will make using Particl much easier, especially for those who haven’t used it in the past. These improvements and additions will also display more information to buyers and sellers, making it easier to track what’s happening within the client (i.e. why funds are moving around, or at what time has a certain transaction been locked into escrow, and etc).</p><h3 id=\"lowering-marketplace-fees\">Lowering Marketplace Fees</h3><p>One of the most reported issue with the Open Marketplace is the cost of listing an item. As the marketplace is fully autonomous and isn’t being operated by any third-party, it charges no commission, subscription, payment processing, or escrow fee at all. It does, however, charge a small listing fee to fight off spam on the network.</p><p>In fact, when listing an item, the network usually charges sellers with a few cents worth of PART every day. And while it isn’t that big of a deal for any seller making a few sales here and there on their listings, especially given the fact that no commission is being charged on top of sales, it can quickly add up for some of the smaller scale vendors who struggle to make sales and sellers with huge inventories (hundreds/thousands of listings).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-OLpQIvxuczEzoa_flsWpfw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Adjusting Marketplace Listing Fees on the Partyman App</figcaption></figure><p>Fortunately, you can actually contribute to making this listing fee smaller. <a href=\"https://particl.news/adjusting-listing-fees-4b676e230601\"><strong>The Particl team has published on their blog a full tutorial</strong></a> on how to instruct your staking node to broadcast a request for lower fees to the SMSG network. SMSG is the network on which marketplace-related content is published and hosted.</p><p>Additionally, the Particl team is in the process of improving and optimizing the SMSG network. It is estimated that the marketplace fees (i.e. listing fees) will significantly be lowered due to the more effective SMSG codebase.</p><p>These changes will come gradually within the Beta phase of development of the marketplace as updates get pushed.</p><h3 id=\"product-import-tool\">Product Import Tool</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-nV8MXWfbGAStemdjRDT_EQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Product Import Tool (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>One of the key components of a two-sided marketplace is getting a good amount of sellers and listed products. This is why the new Particl Open Marketplace roadmap for the next few months includes a lot of tools that will make it easier for sellers to adopt the platform.</p><p>One such tool is the Product Import tool. This tool allows vendors to quickly import large inventories from other sources, considerably reducing the time it takes to populate the marketplace when holding custody of large inventories. Without this feature, sellers need to manually add listings one by one, which is a very time-consuming process.</p><p>With this feature in place, sellers are going to be able to import and list large inventories with only a few clicks. Outside sources for inventory importation will include WooCommerce stores and CSV files (spreadsheets). More options are very likely to be added in the future.</p><h3 id=\"qa-section-ask-a-question-to-a-seller\">Q&#x26;A Section — Ask a Question to a Seller</h3><p>But a two-sided marketplace being a two-sided marketplace, it also needs a good amount of buyers so that it can reach its full potential. This is where the upcoming Q&#x26;A section comes into play.</p><p>This “comment section” will allow anyone to ask questions to vendors before purchasing (or flagging) a product. This isn’t unlike the very popular Q&#x26;A section that Amazon has had for some time now, and it goes a great way into giving you information that might be missing from the item’s description.</p><p>This feature, while not a direct line of contact with the seller, will help buyers make more informed purchasing decisions and give a little bit more confidence when buying an item from a complete stranger. The more you know, the better decisions one can make.</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-settings-page\">Particl Desktop Settings Page</h3><p>The Particl Desktop Settings page is a no-brainer. Currently, if you want to change a configuration on your Particl Desktop client, you either have to modify some config file or enter some command inside the console. This works, but since the goal is to make Particl’s user experience as good as possible, it’s definitely not as user-friendly as it should be.</p><p>The Settings page is pretty much what you would expect from a…settings page. It allows you to change various preferences without having to go through the hassle of finding a tutorial on how to find and modify a config file, or find a list of commands to enter in the console.</p><h3 id=\"market-management-tool\">Market Management Tool</h3><p>The Market Management tool is one of the most awaited features of the Open Marketplace, and rightly so. It is what’s going to make all the individual pieces of the marketplace click together and form into a giant distributed network of markets.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-sQWfEk-U6lWzv8ijSfJBng.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Select What Market (or Storefront) to Browse (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p>Market Management will allow you to either create a market of your own or connect your client to a pre-existing one. These community markets can be created by anyone and are completely independent of the main interface of the Open Marketplace. In fact, they are powered by completely different sets of market keys, meaning no data can be shared between the different markets. It’s like multi-wallets, but more advanced and for markets.</p><p>On Particl, there are two types of markets: community markets, and storefronts.</p><p><strong>Community Markets:</strong> They are markets on which anyone that has access to it can buy or sell goods and services. They function exactly the same as the main interface of the Open Marketplace, and nobody has any special permission over other users. Not even the market creator. These markets, however, are not enabled nor visible by default. To access these markets, you need to connect your Particl Desktop client to its Market ID.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> The main interface of the Open Marketplace is a community market that’s enabled and displayed by default by the Particl Desktop client.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-Gh6FqychOcQ2f49d-D_laA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Joined Markets (and Storefronts) Page (Work-in-Progress)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Storefronts: </strong>They are customizable community markets on which special permissions can be attributed to various users.

There’s nothing wrong with that, of course. After all, a 100% ratio does provide the best game-theory for this type of escrow. There might, however, be some circumstances where such an escrow system wouldn’t be ideal.</p><p>Take the example of a well-known seller that’s already trusted by its customer base and runs a storefront on Particl. This seller might want to move some of its inventory on Particl to save on fees and improve the level of privacy for his business as well as his customers. But since that seller is already well-known and has an established customer base, it might not be ideal for both the seller and its customer to front funds in order to cover a double deposit MAD escrow smart-contract. There is already trust that’s been established between the two parties and, since the seller is running a Particl storefront, he can prove ownership of the products being offered simply by spreading his Market ID on his website or social media pages. In that situation, the required security deposits become an unnecessary obstacle for both the seller and the buyer as they do not necessarily require, or want, escrow protection for transactions.</p><p>What an adjustable escrow would mean is that vendors could set up their own escrow ratio preferences from 0% to 100%. In the above example of a well-known seller running a Particl storefront, he could just reduce his escrow ratio to 0%, meaning no security deposit would be required from neither the buyer or the vendor. This, of course, means that buyers would have no recourse against a dishonest seller, but for those already-established sellers with an existing customer base, having the opportunity to not have to advance coins to fund the escrow system would make adopting Particl’s Open Marketplace much more of a no-brainer.</p><h3 id=\"inventory-and-quantity-management-tool\">Inventory and Quantity Management Tool</h3><p>This feature is self-explanatory. There is no way, currently, to manage a wide inventory and add quantities to your listing. Fortunately, the marketplace back-end currently allows for most of it, but it hasn’t been integrated into the Open Marketplace just yet. Note that a relatively fair amount of development is still needed around this feature and it is likely to be released after the Market Management tool.</p><p>This tool, like its name implies, allows vendors to easily manage inventory quantities, manage multiple listings, and etc. Just like the Product Import tool, Inventory Management is going to make it way easier for sellers with large inventories to take the leap and get started selling on Particl without it being a big hassle.</p><hr><h2 id=\"then-what\"><strong>Then What?</strong></h2><p>All of the above-mentioned items are placed into a short to mid-term roadmap, meaning they are likely to be released within the next few weeks and months, depending on the feature. But wait, there’s more to it!</p><p>The Particl team is thinking ahead and has already planned and started doing research on the features that are going to be worked on once the above marketplace development roadmap is completed.</p><h3 id=\"alternative-payment-options-bitcoin-payments\">Alternative Payment Options — Bitcoin Payments</h3><p>One of the barriers to entry for Particl’s Open Marketplace currently is that it only works with PART, Particl’s native privacy coin. This, of course, is due to the nature of the technology and how the marketplace has to use <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>PART for its privacy and smart-contract capabilities</strong></a>. If it were using Bitcoin, not only would transactions take a considerably longer time due to longer confirmations, but the marketplace wouldn’t be able to offer a private-by-default experience to its users. And if it were using Monero, it would be okay on the privacy side of things, but then the coin couldn’t be used within smart-contracts. The <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>PART coin is a next-generation privacy coin that has both a solid privacy scheme and a flexible codebase</strong></a> which allows it to be used within smart-contracts. As far as privacy coins come, it’s pretty much getting your cake and eating it too! The good stuff…without the limitations.</p><p>But in the end, people want an easy-to-use marketplace with good user experience, and only accepting PART severely limits the number of new users that can be onboarded (that’s because everybody uses Bitcoin, mostly). To address this issue, the Particl team is going to be working on integrating alternative methods of payments, like paying with Bitcoin, for example.</p><p>There are a couple of ways this can be done, either through an atomic swap widget or by integrating a third-party partner. And while the Particl team would like to use an atomic swap solution (research and development on the matter is ongoing at this very moment), a third-party integration might have to be coded in until an atomic swap application is fully ready (and thoroughly tested) to go. There are currently investigations going into this question specifically, and so more details will be able to be communicated in the future.</p><p>It’s important to note though that, regardless of the method chosen to accept different payment methods, the PART coin will always be the coin that settles the transaction in the end. That’s because even though Particl’s Open Marketplace would be accepting Bitcoin, the marketplace Dapp still needs PART to operate as it is the coin that gives it its privacy and smart-contract capabilities. This means any non-PART payments will be automatically converted into a PART transaction, in the background, on behalf of the user. The end result is that the buyer pays with Bitcoin, and the Open Marketplace does all the rest, transferring the Bitcoin into Particl to fuel the escrow contract.</p><h3 id=\"mobile-application\">Mobile Application</h3><p>Another very important upcoming feature is a Particl Open Marketplace mobile application. Indeed, most people now shop on their cellphones, which means downloading a software that requires you to sync two networks (blockchain + SMSG) is definitely a downgrade in terms of user experience. Sure, it provides way better privacy and decentralization, but for most people, this is too weak of an argument against a lazy and fast user-experience.</p><p>And so, to address this issue, the Particl team has scheduled the development of a mobile application. Research is already being put into this item at this very moment, although it is not a top priority for the team right now. That’s because there are still some core features missing to the marketplace (the items in the above roadmap) that need to be added before the team can think of wrapping everything within a mobile application. Once the above roadmap is complete or near-complete, that’s when the Open Marketplace’s mobile application is going to become more of a focus.</p><p>This mobile application will make Particl as accessible as it will have ever been. In fact, most of the world uses cellphones and more and more people now spend more time on their phone than on their computer. To make sure the application has good performance and setup speed, it is more than likely to be a “light wallet”, meaning it won’t require you to download the entire blockchain and SMSG network to function. In other words, this application is intended to be as easy to use as any traditional marketplace mobile application (i.e. Amazon’s application).</p><h3 id=\"developer-sdk-tools\">Developer SDK Tools</h3><p>With bringing more people within the Particl ecosystem in mind, the team has planned for the release of an SDK tool. This tool will be accompanied by various technical documentation that is now currently missing. This will allow outside developers and teams to easily start contributing to the Particl network by developing services, decentralized applications, marketplace features, and etc.</p><p>Because the Open Marketplace is still very much into a heavy development phase, this SDK tool is likely to be one of the last items of this article to see the day. With this in mind, the SDK tool will be going live once the Particl code gets “stable enough” so that it makes sense to commit to a version and write documentation on it.</p><hr><h2 id=\"let-s-wrap-it-up\">Let’s Wrap it Up</h2><p>All of the above-mentioned features that are going to be added to Particl have one thing in common — they are part of a bigger puzzle that’s gonna make the Open Marketplace much more accessible and easy to use for everyone. They all contribute to eliminate the current barriers to entry that makes adopting Particl more complicated for most people.</p><p>Once in place, these should take Particl to the next level, making it a much more credible contender for mainstream adoption. In the meantime, Particl pioneers such as you can still buy and sell anything for crypto, without leaving a trace, using the current version of the Open Marketplace. And since the marketplace is now live on mainnet, new features and improvements can be expected to come out at an accelerated pace!</p><p>Particl is now well on its way on the path towards mainstream adoption. The development team is now a well-oiled machine and is excited to enter this new phase for the Particl project. The base layer is there, now it’s all about putting the last pieces to the puzzle together. This is where it gets exciting and when it starts moving faster!</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-uAgpsfe9xDDVHe1pF6zJdg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":["kg-card","kg-image-card"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Open-Marketplace-and-the-Road-to-Mainstream-Adoption/1-r41YvsRXOJyeVDkN_GcTqg.jpeg","className":["kg-image"],"alt":""},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"new-marketplace-development-update-roadmap"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"New Marketplace Development Update & Roadmap"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"It has now been more than 2 weeks since the Particl Open Marketplace has launched on mainnet.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
