There is a very simple reason behind it: it’s one of the first\ntime people can actually gain full control over their own money and transact\nwith anyone in the world without requiring the assistance or oversight of any\nthird-party or authority figure. In other words, Bitcoin gives us, the people,\nfinancial and economic freedom like never before.\n\nAs great as it sounds, Bitcoin is still unfortunately pretty dependent on\ncentralized infrastructure, and thus, is having a hard time realizing its\nvision. When you think about it, the moment you want to spend your coins, what\ndo you do? Maybe you transfer them to an exchange, trade them against fiat\ncurrencies, make a withdraw into your bank account, and then, finally, visit an\neCommerce platform to make a purchase. Or maybe you have found some service\ncompany that will accept your coins and buy products on the web on your behalf.\nThat is, in both cases, quite costly in terms of fees, time spent navigating\nthrough all these hoops and, most importantly, still pretty much centralized.\nNot only does this practice goes against everything Bitcoin was created for,\nnamely the vision of a new economy, one that is independent of centralized\nauthorities and third-parties, but it also makes Bitcoin’s adoption as a\ncurrency a dud.\n\nSo how do we fix that problem? How can we fill the gap to adoption and place the\nfinal piece of the puzzle, so to speak? How can we get to the point where we\nwon’t have to exit crypto anymore because spending Bitcoin and other coins will\nbe easier than switching back to the old global fiat economy?\n\nBitcoin’s Missing Piece to its Grand Puzzle\nBitcoin is almost everything a currency should be, but there appears to be\nsomething missing for a true crypto-based economy to flourish and thrive. Of\ncourse, some merchants do accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly and\nwithout intermediary, but they are few and far in between and usually difficult\nto find within all the noise. Because most people value convenience so much,\nthey would rather spend more money and “exit” the crypto ecosystem rather than\ngoing through the hassle of finding these vendors.\n\nThe end result is that, as it stands today, Bitcoin is used for mostly three\nthings: trading/speculation, remittance payments, and store of value. It is\ncertainly debatable how much it is used for actual spending, but one thing is\ncertain: spending Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for products and services\nis, at the moment, considerably more of a hassle than simply using fiat\ncurrencies. This makes cryptocurrencies simply unattractive to most people\noutside the relatively small cryptocurrency community and is one of the main\nreasons it is still not recognized as a serious currency.\n\nWhen we, cryptocurrency enthusiasts, dream about mainstream adoption, we have to\nfirst recognize the challenges we still face to this day. Without Bitcoin and\nother cryptocurrencies being at least as easily, affordably, and conveniently\nspendable as traditional currencies, the cryptocurrency ecosystem is likely to\nremain stuck within its own bubble. The path to mainstream adoption of the\nBitcoin decentralized currency and the independent economy it seeks to create\ncannot rely on the centralized infrastructure of the old global fiat economy.\n\n> The path to mainstream adoption of the Bitcoin decentralized currency and the\nindependent economy it seeks to create cannot rely on the centralized\ninfrastructure of the old global fiat economy.\nWith the Bitcoin cryptocurrency ecosystem and community quickly growing within\nthe last few years, it seems the final roadblock in the path to mainstream\nadoption and the realization of crypto as a truly independent economy is the\nability to be able to easily spend coins without third-party and have it be as\nconvenient and affordable as it would be when spending traditional currencies\nwithin the global fiat economy.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Day Has Come for Crypto to Claim its Independence\nUp until now, and even after all these years, there hasn’t been any clear\nsolution to the issue of not being able to spend Bitcoin and other\ncryptocurrencies with the same freedom and convenience you can transact them.\nMany companies and websites have tried to claim they were allowing people to\neasily spend their coins, but in the end, it always required you to trust that\nentity and pay fees on top of it. Far from ideal!\n\nThere is, however, a project presenting itself as a solid and completely\ntrustless solution to the now decade-old coin spending problem, and could very\nwell help Bitcoin’s adoption as an actual currency. Let’s dive right into what\nmakes this project such a good candidate to be that missing piece of the\nBitcoin’s puzzle.\n\nParticl’s Open Marketplace\nBuilt on the most recent Bitcoin codebase, Particl’s Open Marketplace is a\ndecentralized, fully trustless marketplace specifically designed to work with\nyour favorite cryptocurrency. Imagine a platform similar to eBay, but with no\nintermediary whatsoever, the possibility to use your favorite coin (including\nBitcoin), built with privacy at its core, and with barely any fee. All the good\nstuff from eBay…without the bad stuff! Too good to be true? Absolutely not!\n\nThe absence of any intermediary, just like Bitcoin, allows the Open Marketplace\nto run very effectively without any bias and at a bare minimal cost. The\nbuilt-in privacy features included with the Particl network (RingCT on Bitcoin\ncodebase) and the lack of any sort of data mining also insures that no party,\nsuch as a platform operator or payment processor, can access your personal\ninformation. The only data ever shared with another party is your shipping\naddress to the vendors you’re buying products from.\n\nBuilt on the Bitcoin Codebase\nParticl Open Marketplace is built on the latest Bitcoin codebase, meaning it has\nall the latest features brought forth by the most recent updates to Bitcoin,\nincluding a default integration of Segwit, Lightning Network\n[http://lightning.network]-readiness, as well as being compatible with most of\nthe Bitcoin products out there (i.e. Bitpay’s Copay Bitcoin mobile wallet is\nnamed Particl Copay on the Particl blockchain).\n\nIt is important to note, however, that Particl is not an ICO, not an\nEthereum-token, and runs its very own blockchain in order to have full control\nover its ecosystem. The blockchain was launched in a very fair way years ago and\nis developed by a team of mostly Bitcoin fanatics [http://particl.io/about-us] \nthat have been working in crypto for quite some time and have made names for\nthemselves. Particl’s Github page [http://github.com/particl] is one of the most\nactive one in the entire blockchain industry, and the amount of work being done\non it is tremendous, especially in comparison to other cryptocurrency projects,\nalways ranking in among the top coins in Darpal’s Github Audit Reports\n[https://medium.com/@DPRating].\n\nUse Your Favorite Coin\nStraying away from the counter-productive “tribalism” currently plaguing the\ncrypto industry, Particl Open Marketplace’s underlying protocol is designed to\nwork with your favorite cryptocurrency. While initial versions of the\nmarketplace might only work with PART to begin with, it has been coded in such a\nway that integrating almost any coin to its platform is made trivial. Of course,\nBitcoin is planned to be the first coin introduced to the platform.\n\nTribalism, or the bad habit many people in the crypto industry adopt when\nfighting over “who has the best coin or platform”, is not a philosophy endorsed\nby the Particl team. Contrary to many ICOs and “new” blockchain projects, \nParticl is free for almost any crypto community to use and does not discriminate\nin favor of its native currency. Forcing users to use a native currency is a\nmistake we see way too often now in the industry and a gimmick that is highly\nunappealing to most people. Particl’s Open Marketplace is designed to benefit\nthe entire crypto ecosystem and add utility to all coins!\n\nPrivate-by-Design\nUsing some of the latest privacy technologies in the industry, the Open\nMarketplace is private-by-design, meaning that all purchases and sales made from\nwithin its platform are private by default, regardless of the coin used to make\nthe purchase.\n\nIn fact, Particl has been the first project to integrate RingCT, the privacy\nprotocol made popular by Monero, on the Bitcoin codebase (or any other codebase\nother than Cryptonote, for that matter). Moreover, the entire platform is built\nwith privacy at its core, meaning no data can ever leak out of the platform or\nbe recorded in a publicly auditable fashion on the blockchain, protecting its\nusers from abusive data analysis and industry copycats. Content is stripped of\nall its metadata (i.e. listing pictures) and every aspect of the marketplace is\ndesigned to make transactions and user identities indistinguishable.\nAdditionally, you can start your own private market (currently called “bubbles”)\nand make products available only to those who you send the access key to, making\nthe entire process even more private and completely away from the eyes of\ncompetitors.\n\nRidiculously Low Fees\nParticl’s Initial Fee Schedule (Will Decrease Over Time)What would be the use of\nsuch a marketplace if fees were high? The whole point of this article was to, in\npart, point out how expensive shopping with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies\ncan get because you are forced to use third-parties which, among the many\ndisadvantages they cause, charge users with fees that make spending coins not a\ncost-effective activity. For the crypto economy to really become a viable\noption, fees need to be kept at a minimum, which is exactly the case on\nParticl’s Open Marketplace.\n\nWhile Particl is already very low on fees at this current moment in time, it\nwill ultimately reach its vision and be fully integrated with both scalable and\nentirely trustless solutions which will make it a near-zero fee platform.\nProtocols such as atomic swaps\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atomic-swaps.asp] (already live on mainnet\nsince October 2017), Lightning Network [http://lightning.network], Segwit, and\nothers will make using Particl extremely affordable and as convenient and fast\nas traditional eCommerce platforms.\n\nGenerally speaking, charging vendors with barely any fee, especially when they\nare used to be being abused by traditional platforms, means they will be able to\neither make more profit-per-sale or lower their prices to gain an advantage over\ntheir competitors and get bigger sales volume. The end result for the customer\nis likely to be more affordable products than anywhere else on the web. Fees on\ntraditional eCommerce platforms are outrageous, the new crypto economy is a fair\none that is centered around its users, not the platform’s operator!\n\nNo Intermediary At All\nNo, you are not dreaming. All of this is indeed available without the use of any\nthird-party or central authority whatsoever. Every feature available on the Open\nMarketplace comes from 100% trustless protocols. For example, atomic swaps is\nthe protocol used to enable you to use your favorite coin. The escrow is managed\nthrough a mechanism using a smart-contract and security deposits and is based on\nthe MAD game-theory. The governance (or moderation) of the marketplace’s content\nis entirely controlled by the community.\n\nThere is absolutely no intermediary on Particl, just like there is no\nintermediary involved when transacting Bitcoin from person-to-person. In other\nwords, everything that Bitcoin has which made its cryptocurrency great, Particl\noffers the same but to the eCommerce industry. No intermediary means anything\nyou do within the platform is perfectly secure and untraceable, that your data\nisn’t collected or shared with anyone, and that the platform can be used at a\nbare minimal cost.\n\nAs mentioned earlier in this article, the path to mainstream adoption of the\nBitcoin decentralized currency and the independent economy it seeks to create\ncannot rely on the centralized infrastructure of the old global fiat economy.\n\nEarn Cryptocurrencies While You Sleep\nAnother important aspect of an “economy” is to be able to earn transferable\nvalue (currency) directly within it. This is precisely what Particl makes\npossible.\n\nIn fact, not only can you sell products and services online to earn\ncryptocurrencies without requiring any intermediary, but you also receive the\nentirety of the fees generated by the Particl platform as a coin holder. This\naspect of the platform constitutes a great source of passive income and is\nexpected to get exponentially profitable as the marketplace sees more sales\nvolume per day. This passive income mechanism also applies to all future paid\n(but optional) features of the marketplace such as featured listing spots, for\nexample.\n\nThe Power of Community\nWith Particl’s Open Marketplace, you can expect convenience like never seen\nbefore when looking for vendors that accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nBecause Particl presents itself as a common ground for both vendors and buyers,\nit makes it very easy to find the product or service you are looking for or to\nget the exposure you deserve as a vendor accepting crypto. Looking for\nsomething? Just type what you wish to purchase in the search bar, and be exposed\nto a multitude of vendors selling what you need. Selling stuff? Just list your\nproducts on the Open Marketplace and instantly get the exposure you deserve in\nfront of the right target audience. Gone are the days spent digging through\nsearch engines and advertising your business on obscure cryptocurrency forums,\nthe world is now at your fingertips and is available at minimum effort!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Building Blocks of the New Economy\nBitcoin and Particl’s Open Marketplace are entirely complementary and made to\nlive side-by-side. If we were to compare the new, independent economy made\npossible by Bitcoin and Particl to a house, Bitcoin would be its cornerstone (or\nits foundation) while Particl would the support beams. Bitcoin is what started\nit all (the cornerstone), but without its support beams, the house would not be\nable to stand ground for much longer, let alone withstand severe storms of FUD\nand speculation-led bear markets.\n\nBe Part of the Solution\nThe mainnet release of Particl Open Marketplace is rapidly approaching, and the\ndays where Bitcoin was stuck within its own bubble caused by the inconvenience\nof spending coins are now coming to an end. With a super convenient, affordable,\neye-candy, and trustless solution to spend coins about to see the day, now is\nthe time to get involved!\n\nParticl Open Marketplace is currently undergoing heavy testing on public testnet\nand is nearing its Beta release, and we need you now more than ever! Come to\njoin our community, connect with other pioneers of the new, independent economy,\nand spread the word around. We now stand at the forefront of one of the biggest\nfinancial revolution to ever see the day: the birth of the first truly global\nand independent economy powered by Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Bitcoin---Particl--Building-an-Independent-Economy-Together/1-LejDfDLZGzsWcTxixmLHzA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Bitcoin is often considered the most important technological breakthrough since the internet.

In other words, Bitcoin gives us, the people, financial and economic freedom like never before.</p><p>As great as it sounds, Bitcoin is still unfortunately pretty dependent on centralized infrastructure, and thus, is having a hard time realizing its vision. When you think about it, the moment you want to spend your coins, what do you do? Maybe you transfer them to an exchange, trade them against fiat currencies, make a withdraw into your bank account, and then, finally, visit an eCommerce platform to make a purchase. Or maybe you have found some service company that will accept your coins and buy products on the web on your behalf. That is, in both cases, quite costly in terms of fees, time spent navigating through all these hoops and, most importantly, still pretty much centralized.

Of course, some merchants do accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly and without intermediary, but they are few and far in between and usually difficult to find within all the noise.

It is certainly debatable how much it is used for actual spending, but one thing is certain: spending Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for products and services is, at the moment, considerably more of a hassle than simply using fiat currencies. This makes cryptocurrencies simply unattractive to most people outside the relatively small cryptocurrency community and is one of the main reasons it is still not recognized as a serious currency.</p><p>When we, cryptocurrency enthusiasts, dream about mainstream adoption, we have to first recognize the challenges we still face to this day.

Many companies and websites have tried to claim they were allowing people to easily spend their coins, but in the end, it always required you to trust that entity and pay fees on top of it. Far from ideal!</p><p>There is, however, a project presenting itself as a solid and completely trustless solution to the now decade-old coin spending problem, and could very well help Bitcoin’s adoption as an actual currency. Let’s dive right into what makes this project such a good candidate to be that missing piece of the Bitcoin’s puzzle.</p><h3 id=\"particl-s-open-marketplace\">Particl’s Open Marketplace</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Bitcoin---Particl--Building-an-Independent-Economy-Together/1-ic2Ys6LH0rRcc9IiHUJ-XA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Built on the most recent Bitcoin codebase, Particl’s Open Marketplace is a decentralized, fully trustless marketplace specifically designed to work with your favorite cryptocurrency. Imagine a platform similar to eBay, but with <strong>no intermediary</strong> whatsoever, the <strong>possibility to use your favorite coin</strong> (including Bitcoin), <strong>built with privacy at its core</strong>, and <strong>with barely any fee</strong>. All the good stuff from eBay…without the bad stuff! Too good to be true? Absolutely not!</p><p>The absence of any intermediary, just like Bitcoin, allows the Open Marketplace to run very effectively without any bias and at a bare minimal cost. The built-in privacy features included with the Particl network (RingCT on Bitcoin codebase) and the lack of any sort of data mining also insures that <strong>no party</strong>, such as a platform operator or payment processor, <strong>can access your personal information</strong>. The only data ever shared with another party is your shipping address to the vendors you’re buying products from.</p><h3 id=\"built-on-the-bitcoin-codebase\"><strong>Built on the Bitcoin Codebase</strong></h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Bitcoin---Particl--Building-an-Independent-Economy-Together/1-t2vpHIAhhHL09kj6CLmGjg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Particl Open Marketplace is built on the latest Bitcoin codebase, meaning it has all the latest features brought forth by the most recent updates to Bitcoin, including a default integration of Segwit, <a href=\"http://lightning.network\"><strong>Lightning Network</strong></a>-readiness, as well as being compatible with most of the Bitcoin products out there (i.e. Bitpay’s Copay Bitcoin mobile wallet is named Particl Copay on the Particl blockchain).</p><p>It is important to note, however, that Particl is <strong>not an ICO</strong>, <strong>not an Ethereum-token</strong>, and runs its very own blockchain in order to have full control over its ecosystem. The blockchain was launched in a very fair way years ago and is <a href=\"http://particl.io/about-us\"><strong>developed by a team of mostly Bitcoin fanatics</strong></a><strong> </strong>that have been working in crypto for quite some time and have made names for themselves. <a href=\"http://github.com/particl\"><strong>Particl’s Github page</strong></a> is one of the most active one in the entire blockchain industry, and the amount of work being done on it is tremendous, especially in comparison to other cryptocurrency projects, always ranking in among the top coins in <a href=\"https://medium.com/@DPRating\"><strong>Darpal’s Github Audit Reports</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"use-your-favorite-coin\"><strong>Use Your Favorite Coin</strong></h3><p>Straying away from the counter-productive “tribalism” currently plaguing the crypto industry, Particl Open Marketplace’s underlying protocol is <strong>designed to work with your favorite cryptocurrency</strong>. While initial versions of the marketplace might only work with PART to begin with, it has been coded in such a way that integrating almost any coin to its platform is made trivial. Of course, Bitcoin is planned to be the first coin introduced to the platform.</p><p>Tribalism, or the bad habit many people in the crypto industry adopt when fighting over “who has the best coin or platform”, is not a philosophy endorsed by the Particl team. Contrary to many ICOs and “new” blockchain projects, <strong>Particl is free for almost any crypto community to use and does not discriminate in favor of its native currency</strong>. Forcing users to use a native currency is a mistake we see way too often now in the industry and a gimmick that is highly unappealing to most people. Particl’s Open Marketplace is designed to benefit the entire crypto ecosystem and add utility to all coins!</p><h3 id=\"private-by-design\"><strong>Private-by-Design</strong></h3><p>Using some of the latest privacy technologies in the industry, the Open Marketplace is private-by-design, meaning that <strong>all purchases and sales made from within its platform are private by default</strong>, regardless of the coin used to make the purchase.</p><p>In fact, Particl has been the <strong>first project </strong>to integrate <strong>RingCT</strong>, the privacy protocol made popular by Monero, on the Bitcoin codebase (or any other codebase other than Cryptonote, for that matter). Moreover, the entire platform is built with privacy at its core, meaning <strong>no data can ever leak out of the platform</strong> or be recorded in a publicly auditable fashion on the blockchain, protecting its users from abusive data analysis and industry copycats. Content is stripped of all its metadata (i.e. listing pictures) and every aspect of the marketplace is designed to make transactions and user identities indistinguishable. Additionally, you can start your own private market (currently called “bubbles”) and make products available only to those who you send the access key to, making the entire process even more private and completely away from the eyes of competitors.</p><h3 id=\"ridiculously-low-fees\"><strong>Ridiculously Low Fees</strong></h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Bitcoin---Particl--Building-an-Independent-Economy-Together/1-ro6GHoRZk1JIctiO64ac9Q.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl’s Initial Fee Schedule (Will Decrease Over Time)</figcaption></figure><p>What would be the use of such a marketplace if fees were high? The whole point of this article was to, in part, point out how expensive shopping with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can get because you are forced to use third-parties which, among the many disadvantages they cause, charge users with fees that make spending coins not a cost-effective activity. For the crypto economy to really become a viable option, fees need to be kept at a minimum, which is exactly the case on Particl’s Open Marketplace.</p><p>While Particl is already <strong>very low on fees</strong> at this current moment in time, it will ultimately reach its vision and be fully integrated with both scalable and entirely trustless solutions which <strong>will make it a near-zero fee platform</strong>. Protocols such as <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atomic-swaps.asp\"><strong>atomic swaps</strong></a> (already live on mainnet since October 2017), <a href=\"http://lightning.network\"><strong>Lightning Network</strong></a>, Segwit, and others will make using Particl extremely affordable and as convenient and fast as traditional eCommerce platforms.</p><p>Generally speaking, charging vendors with barely any fee, especially when they are used to be being abused by traditional platforms, means they will be able to either make more profit-per-sale or lower their prices to gain an advantage over their competitors and get bigger sales volume. The end result for the customer is likely to be more affordable products than anywhere else on the web. Fees on traditional eCommerce platforms are outrageous, the new crypto economy is a fair one that is centered around its users, not the platform’s operator!</p><h3 id=\"no-intermediary-at-all\"><strong>No Intermediary At All</strong></h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Bitcoin---Particl--Building-an-Independent-Economy-Together/1-o2H8JUZgcWaZkbjIHVRB9w.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>No, you are not dreaming. All of this is indeed available without the use of any third-party or central authority whatsoever. Every feature available on the Open Marketplace comes from <strong>100% trustless</strong> protocols. For example, atomic swaps is the protocol used to enable you to use your favorite coin. The escrow is managed through a mechanism using a smart-contract and security deposits and is based on the MAD game-theory. The governance (or moderation) of the marketplace’s content is entirely controlled by the community.</p><p><strong>There is absolutely no intermediary on Particl</strong>, just like there is no intermediary involved when transacting Bitcoin from person-to-person. In other words, everything that Bitcoin has which made its cryptocurrency great, Particl offers the same but to the eCommerce industry. No intermediary means anything you do within the platform is perfectly secure and untraceable, that your data isn’t collected or shared with anyone, and that the platform can be used at a bare minimal cost.</p><p>As mentioned earlier in this article, the path to mainstream adoption of the Bitcoin decentralized currency and the independent economy it seeks to create cannot rely on the centralized infrastructure of the old global fiat economy.</p><h3 id=\"earn-cryptocurrencies-while-you-sleep\"><strong>Earn Cryptocurrencies While You Sleep</strong></h3><p>Another important aspect of an “economy” is to be able to earn transferable value (currency) directly within it. This is precisely what Particl makes possible.</p><p>In fact, not only can you sell products and services online to earn cryptocurrencies without requiring any intermediary, but you also <strong>receive the entirety of the fees generated by the Particl platform</strong> as a coin holder. This aspect of the platform constitutes a great source of passive income and is expected to get exponentially profitable as the marketplace sees more sales volume per day. This passive income mechanism also applies to all future paid (but optional) features of the marketplace such as featured listing spots, for example.</p><h3 id=\"the-power-of-community\"><strong>The Power of Community</strong></h3><p>With Particl’s Open Marketplace, you can expect <strong>convenience</strong> like never seen before when looking for vendors that accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Because Particl presents itself as a common ground for both vendors and buyers, it makes it very easy to find the product or service you are looking for or to get the exposure you deserve as a vendor accepting crypto. Looking for something? Just type what you wish to purchase in the search bar, and be exposed to a multitude of vendors selling what you need. Selling stuff? Just list your products on the Open Marketplace and instantly get the exposure you deserve in front of the right target audience. Gone are the days spent digging through search engines and advertising your business on obscure cryptocurrency forums, the world is now at your fingertips and is available at minimum effort!</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Bitcoin---Particl--Building-an-Independent-Economy-Together/1-ywqAnNA29pZqUYbTD6X85g.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><h2 id=\"the-building-blocks-of-the-new-economy\">The Building Blocks of the New Economy</h2><p>Bitcoin and Particl’s Open Marketplace are entirely complementary and made to live side-by-side.

Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\nWhen is the RingCT and governance hardfork is going to happen?\nThere is no official date set for it yet, and the plan to combine RingCT and\ngovernance into the same hardfork hasn’t changed since we last spoke about it.\nTecnovert is still working on some RingCT improvements on stability,\nperformance, and security, and wants to complete those before releasing it on\nmainnet. He did start to officially work on the Bulletproofs implementation and\nso it is likely that it will hit mainnet WITH bulletproofs included.\n\nDoes the Particl team plans on integrating a lock-up time for PART coins when\nthey are unlocked for staking so that coins are locked for a longer time and\ncan’t be moved/staked/sold before your node finds a block?\nIn short, it is not an immediate issue we are targeting. While this might be a\ngood idea, in theory, to make it more difficult for people to accumulate coins\nand then misuse them to attack the project by abusing the Proof-of-Stake\nprotocol, such as measure would likely severely handicap Particl as a currency.\nThis isn’t to say that a similar measure won’t ever be considered or\nimplemented, after all, Particl is all about security, but right now the focus\nis mostly on Particl Marketplace and Particl Desktop. It’s important to note\nthat we have a Research & Development team constantly putting up to test,\nresearching, and evaluating the many solutions popping up all over the industry,\nmeaning that our team is pro-actively putting your security at the highest\npriority.\n\nOne interesting dynamics related to this question specifically is how Particl\nMarketplace’s escrow mechanism, which is based on the MAD game-theory and\nrequires double security deposits from both vendors and buyers, will actually\nlock some of the supply out of circulation. In fact, both vendors and buyers\nneed to deposit funds into an escrow smart-contract to ensure both parties’\nhonesty. This, in turn, results in a portion of the supply being locked.\nContrary to the proposed solution in this question, having some of the supply\nlocked through the marketplace’s escrow is much more organic and less intrusive,\nas everyone who’s going to contribute to this “lock up” will do so in a\nperfectly voluntary basis, as opposed to being “forced” to lock some coins up\nfor an extended period of time by the protocol. This is a scenario we believe to\nbe more fair to the users and less handicapping. Additionally, in the future,\nmore Dapps could make use of Particl’s decentralized escrow mechanism and lock\neven more supply out of circulation, especially once we release the developed\nSDK toolkit. This will make it considerably harder for attackers to acquire\nlarge sums of coins and misuse them against the network (although that behavior\nis akin to an “economic suicide” from the attacker’s standpoint).\n\nLooking at recent events with Charlie Shrem, does he have access to any\ndocumentation or internal chats?\nNo, none of our advisors have any access to internal chats and documents, except\nfor Joe Fisher which has been heavily involved with Particl Marketplace lately\n(as per his experience as a career product inventor and online seller). All of\nCharlie’s communication with the team has been done through private messages.\nLike any other company that would have one of its advisors accused of some\nmisbehavior, we’re adopting a wait and see approach to the situation, instead\ndeciding to keep a close eye on the situation rather than proceed to hasty\nconclusions. Should Charlie Shrem be recognized guilty of the allegations made\nagainst him, we will have no choice but to distance ourselves from him and his\nbrand. Until that point, we’re staying alert to the situation.\n\nWill Particl hire a market maker and make deals with bigger exchanges\nlike Binance?\nIt seems that some representative from Binance may be hanging in our community\nand chatrooms as we get some pretty pointed questions from them from times to\ntimes regarding happenings, updates, and news we publish. While in reality, this\nmay not mean anything, it is definitely a good thing for the industry in general\nthat this exchange is keeping itself super diligent. Some of their questions are\nactually pretty good and shows they really are keeping a close eye on what’s\nhappening surrounding the project.\n\nRight now, we’re mostly focused on larger exchanges such as, of course, Binance,\nbut also Coinbase, Circle, Poloniex, Bitfinex, and other similarly large\nexchanges. We do not focus on smaller exchanges that are asking for a listing\nfee and that we believe wouldn’t yield us some return (in terms of community\ngrowth) on our investment. This is directly in line with our responsible fund\nmanagement strategy and part of the reason why we are guaranteed to have funds\nfor development for at least until the end of Q1 2019 (after which an additional\nfunding round will be in sight).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nStatus Report\nParticl.io * Privacy-focused Decentralized Applications\n[http://particl.io/status-report/]\nParticl provides a decentralized privacy platform with a suite of tools to\nenhance your online privacy * Private… [http://particl.io/status-report/]\nparticl.io [http://particl.io/status-report/]\n\nAs always, a new Status Report was published at the same time we did our last\nlivestream. This report indicates a couple of items to be completed, such as \nuniformed height of listing items, drag’n’drop capability added when adding\nlistings, and proposals/votes to be based on time instead of blocks. Newly added\nto the In Development section are the governance system coin weight system, \nprivate markets, and proposal enhancements. As always, Tecnovert is still\nworking on improving the RingCT implementation with enhancements and \nBulletproofs. The current team meeting in South Africa is likely to shape future\nStatus Report and further the internal roadmap.\n\nConferences & Meetups\n> \nAs we have been saying lately, our intention is to start getting a more direct\nexposure by directly reaching out to the most passionate individuals of the\ncrypto scene by getting a better exposure at various crypto events. Nothing\nbeats the human interaction of discussing in-person the subject we are all\npassionate about!\n\n> \nOur newest team member, Lina Seiche, was specifically hired with this in mind\nand has already started integrating Particl into the blockchain presentations\nshe had already scheduled. Because she is seemingly falling in love with\nParticl, and also because of her own company, block-chats\n[https://block-chats.com/], it is to be expected that Particl will now be\nintegrated into most of their events, in some way or the other, in addition to\nthe Particl-themed events she’ll be organizing.\n\nAs such, she’s started planning the first of many future Particl-themed events.\nIn fact, on the 14th of December, Particl is going to hold its first official\nevent in Manilla, Philippines. This Christmas-themed Particl event will not only\nfocus on Particl but will also hold a panel of experts and well-known blockchain\npublic figures in that region. The panel will focus on eCommerce and why it is\nin dire need of decentralization and will be composed of leaders in the\nPhilippines blockchain industry such as:\n\n * Miguel Cuneta — Co-Founder of SCI [https://sci.ph/] & Particl Advisor\n * Mark Vernon — Founder of TagCash [https://tagcash.com/], a large\n   Philippines-based crypto company and very well-known within the Asian\n   community\n * Chris Verceles — Blockchain developer at Consensys [https://consensys.net/]\n * Colin Goltra — Head of Cryptocurrency Program at Coin.ph [https://coins.ph/]\n * Gerb Inajada — Head of Blockchain Technology at UnionBank\n   [https://www.unionbank.com/]\n * Alenna Dawn Magpantay — Philippines Ambassador for Coding Girls\n   [https://www.coding-girls.com/]\n\nFor more information about this event, please follow these links: \nhttps://block-chats.com/christmas-fair-2018/ & \nhttps://www.meetup.com/BlockChatsPhilippines/events/256492831/\n\nWe’ve also have been reaching out to our key contacts within the French\ncommunity and are planning a meetup/conference in Paris shortly. We will give\nmore information about this one at a future time.\n\nParticl Chosen to Present at the Toronto CryptoCamp Blockchain Unconference\nHome [https://www.cryptocamp.community/]\nToronto | 29.11.18 Crypto camp Get your tickets!\n[https://www.cryptocamp.community/]www.cryptocamp.community\n[https://www.cryptocamp.community/]\n\nParticl has been chosen among 80 applications to present its Particl Marketplace\nproduct at the Blockchain Unconference in Toronto on the 29th of November.\n\n> CryptoCamp is Toronto’s first-ever blockchain unconference. This\n100%-volunteer-led event aims to bring the entire blockchain community together,\nshowcase some of the most interesting products and projects, and pay it forward\nby offering Blockchain Bootcamp workshops. Organized by the community for the\ncommunity, CryptoCamp aims to grow, connect, and diversify the ecosystem. Come\nto meet other crypto-curious and crypto-scaredies, and connect with\nprofessionals working in this space. This event is for you.\nThis conference is mainly focused on two things: education, and the presentation\nof actual products making use of the blockchain technology. This event will be\nhosted at the Deloitte Office in Toronto and will take place over two entire\nfloors.\n\nThe first part of the day will be dedicated to education. In fact, many speakers\nwill give educational talks about crypto and blockchain technology in general to\na wide audience of crypto enthusiasts. The second part of the day, which is when\nwe are scheduled to present Particl Marketplace to the crowd, is focused on\nshowcasing actual blockchain products. In fact, a series of speakers will each\nbe demonstrating their blockchain products in front of experts in the field and\nexplain how they foresee it making an impact on the industry they’re each\ntargeting. With around 80 submitted applications or so, the event has chosen\nParticl as one of the projects it wants to see presented!\n\nTickets for the entire event are available at this link\n[https://www.eventbrite.com/e/crypto-camp-at-deloitte-tickets-51716842468#tickets]\n, and we hope to have the chance to meet some of you who live close to Toronto.\nThis event is organized in part by CryptoChicks, a rather well-known blockchain\ngroup in Canada, and has partnered with several key sponsors such as Deloitte,\nShyft, BlockGeeks, TWG, and many more to make it a memorable moment. If you’re\naround the area and would like to come, let us know in advance so that we can\nmeet up at some point!\n\nSee the full list of speakers here: https://www.cryptocamp.community/speakers/\n\nDevelopment Team Meeting in South Africa\nThe team is currently meeting near Elizabeth Port in South Africa for its\nquarterly meeting.

In fact, both vendors and buyers need to deposit funds into an escrow smart-contract to ensure both parties’ honesty. This, in turn, results in a portion of the supply being locked. Contrary to the proposed solution in this question, having some of the supply locked through the marketplace’s escrow is much more organic and less intrusive, as everyone who’s going to contribute to this “lock up” will do so in a perfectly voluntary basis, as opposed to being “forced” to lock some coins up for an extended period of time by the protocol. This is a scenario we believe to be more fair to the users and less handicapping. Additionally, in the future, more Dapps could make use of Particl’s decentralized escrow mechanism and lock even more supply out of circulation, especially once we release the developed SDK toolkit. This will make it considerably harder for attackers to acquire large sums of coins and misuse them against the network (although that behavior is akin to an “economic suicide” from the attacker’s standpoint).</p><h3 id=\"looking-at-recent-events-with-charlie-shrem-does-he-have-access-to-any-documentation-or-internal-chats\">Looking at recent events with Charlie Shrem, does he have access to any documentation or internal chats?</h3><p>No, none of our advisors have any access to internal chats and documents, except for Joe Fisher which has been heavily involved with Particl Marketplace lately (as per his experience as a career product inventor and online seller). All of Charlie’s communication with the team has been done through private messages.

Her entrance into the blockchain industry came through her\nposition as the PR Manager and Evangelist for a Tokyo-founded cryptocurrency\nhedge fund platform where she would break down language barriers launching\nglobal roadshows and marketing activities.\nThe founder of BlockChats [https://block-chats.com/], an event, and lifestyle\ncommunity focused on education, inspiration, and international connection in and\naround the blockchain space, Lina aims to deliver unusual concepts to the\ngrowing communities around the world in order to shine a light on the\nopportunities in the industry.\nTrue to the spirit of the blockchain universe, she is a constant traveler in\nbetween countries and blockchain destinations, placing a special focus on\nemerging markets and the collaboration between communities all over the world.\nShe will still sing for you if you ask nicely, or if there’s a karaoke\nhappening.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLina’s going to be touching on a lot of stuff and be a great asset for the\nproject. Whether it be organizing events or talking at conferences, building\n“boots on the ground” communities, producing videos, helping with social media,\nor writing articles, her experience in the blockchain and business industries is\ngoing to be a game-changer for the project.\n\nLina already has a good following and community through her BlockChats\n[https://block-chats.com/] meetups (focused on blockchain education), her \nSatoshi Citadel Industries [https://sci.ph/] connections (both SCI’s founders,\nMiguel and John, are part of Particl’s advisory team), and from her continued\npresence at various blockchain events. In fact, anything event-related is going\nto be one of Lina’s core role within the team.\n\nAs such, for the month of November, she’s already scheduled to present an\neducative talk at BlockLab\n[https://block-chats.com/events/manila/blocklab-dish-edition/] on the 10th of\nNovember as well as give speeches at the DISH2018 [https://dish2018.com/] \nhackathon on the 24th and 25th of November.

Don’t worry, this update should keep you up to speed with all\nthe latest developments and news surrounding the project!\n\nYou also don’t want to miss the News & Updates part of this Community Update as\nwe’ll reveal some details about Particl’s new team member, Lina!\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\nNote: This edition of the AMA/FAQ livestream features Arnold Bansemer as a\nguest. Some of the answers to the questions included in this summary have been\nparaphrased and shortened to fit with the Community Update format. Please refer\nto the provided timestamps for the exact answer from Arnold himself!\n\n(2:34 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=154]) Arnold Bansemer Introduces Himself\n“I’ve taken over from Kewde as Lead Developer for Particl Desktop, however, I\nstill refer back to him from time to time as he’s been a huge part of building\nParticl Desktop, so he’s not entirely relieved from its “duty”. What I mostly do\nis code reviews, manage merge and pull requests as well as help other developers\nwhen they have difficulties or issues with some specific tasks. I also have my\nown development workload, of course.”\n\n(3:56 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=236]) Are you only working on Particl\nDesktop or do you also work on the marketplace?\n“If my help is required, I’ll always be there to assist the marketplace\ndevelopers. As a matter of fact, I’ve already submitted some PRs (pull requests)\nabout it, although I am still finding my way myself through the marketplace\ncode. In fact, there’s a lot of code done on Particl Marketplace! The\nMarketplace Team is also very strong and experienced and I don’t think I’m\nneeded that much to assist them, but if there is a need I’ll be there!”\n\n(6:20 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=380]) Is there any update on the cold\nstaking pool?\nThe cold staking pools are more or less ready to be released. If you are already\non the #testing channel on Riot or Discord, you can see Tecnovert has already\nmade the code publicly available. Not only has the code been made available, but\ntesting as well. In fact, in the #testing channel were posted instructions on\nhow to test the staking pool on both testnet and mainnet networks. The more\ntesters we get, the quicker we can identify and fix issues and get it officially\nreleased.\n\nSneak peek of the cold staking pool’s user interfaceIt’s important to note that\nthe publicly available staking pools do not have any GUI interface and are very\nbarebone. While the GUI has been under development for some time now, it will\nonly be available on the official launch day of the staking pools.\n\nThe code itself is not hosted under Particl’s Github account, just like\nDasource’s Partyman cold staking app. The code for the cold staking pools is\nhosted under Tecnovert’s personal account here: \nhttps://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool. We encourage everyone to\ntest, study, tweak, or fork the code if they want to.\n\nKeep an eye out for any update about cold staking pools in the coming weeks!\n\n(10:21 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=621]) Arnold, what’s your fresh\nperspective of the project?\n“One thing that particularly stood out when I first joined the Particl project\nis the passion, dedication, and technical skills of the team members. I can even\nsay that at first, I was a little bit intimidated by that as everyone really is\non top of their game, I was wondering how I would measure up to them. There is\nso much that has been accomplished code wise and it’s pretty impressive. I can\nsay this is what really stood out for me as a new team member.”\n\n(12:41 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=760]) What do you think the project is\n“behind”?\n“As far as what we are behind with…well we are always “generally behind” when it\ncomes to any project development. It’s a bit difficult to put into perspective\nbecause there’s a lot of work to be done, but we’re also moving as fast as we\ncan given the size of the team. I don’t see, however, any particular aspect of\nthe project that is specifically behind other aspects or being neglected. We’re\nstill on track to wrap up governance this month, and probably get Beta ready for\nthe next month or so. One thing we gotta be careful about though is to finish\nwhat we start working on first before implementing new features/functions, or\nelse it becomes hard to finish things up properly. I think we’ve been pretty\ngood on that end though.”\n\n(14:50 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=884]) As a new team member, did you\nfeel welcome?\n“Yes, but it’s a bit different than what I am used to. I come from the more\ntraditional 9 to 5 job model where you work in an office and have a set\nschedule. Usually, during your first day at the office, you are directly\nintroduced to everyone you’ll be working with and so it is easy to get to know\nyour new co-workers quickly.\n\nParticl being a decentralized team, it’s a bit different. You kind of have to\nmake the first steps because everyone is so busy and caught up in their work.\nThere’s also the fact that most conversations happen over text in chat, so it’s\nnot as easy to get to know your new co-workers as an in-office job. But yes, I\ndid feel welcome, and so far most team members have been willing to sacrifice\nsome of their time to chat a little and get to me know better!”\n\n(17:14 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1034]) Are you going to the South Africa\ntrimestrial team meeting?\n“Yes, I’ll be there! I actually live in South Africa so it won’t be difficult\nfor me to get where the meetings are. I’ll surely be taking part in some of the\ndeveloper meetings and will be there to finally meet the rest of the team in\nperson! This will definitely be beneficial to get together, in person, to flesh\nout ideas in a more direct way than over chats or conference calls!”\n\n(19:40) What would you say to others who may want to join the development? Would\nyou recommend it?\n“I can’t comment on what the Foundation does and who they hire, but I definitely\nrecommend participating from a community contribution perspective. Do it,\nplease, it’s important and helps a lot! This is a community project and\ncontributions are welcomed in more than one way. If you’ve got an idea for a\nfeature or just a general proposal, then, by all means, log it on Github or code\nit up then submit a pull request. I’ll definitely review it for integration and\nit might just make it if the review is positive. We’ll never say no to\ncontributions, especially as we have a small team. There’s only so much we can\ndo at a given time. Right now, we’re really busy with the marketplace code. If\nthere’s something that’s not within our immediate focus, you can contribute and\nwe will look into each submission for sure!”\n\n(22:19 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1339]) What’s your opinion on the few\nbugs identified on the latest Particl Marketplace Alpha builds?\n“A couple of them are easy fixes and have already fixed in internal builds.\nThere have been, however, one or two bugs that have been trickier in fixing,\nnotably due to reproduction issues (recreating the bug internally) and figuring\nout how they’re happening. We’re making good progress on them though, especially\non the [object Object] issue lots of people have been having.\n\nIn most cases, the fixes are pretty simple, it’s more about figuring about how\nthe bugs are generated and not breaking anything else while fixing them. That's\npretty much what automated test cases are for, and I think we need to have more\nof them. It’s one of the goals we’re all currently working towards at the same\ntime as shown in the status report. Also, as mentioned before, more community\ntesters definitely helps to identify and troubleshoot these issues.”\n\n(25:22 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1522]) Will you guys put new testnet\nbuilds out now that the download links have expired?\n“What we’re trying to avoid with the 10-day expiry limit on download links is\nthe number of available bugs out there. We don’t want people using old builds\nand reporting bugs and issues that have already been fixed in new releases.\nThere’s also a second aspect to it in that we ideally want to include new stuff\nfor the community to test everytime we do new releases to keep it interesting to\nthe community to keep the number of testers high! There should be a new testnet\nbuild coming out soon so keep an eye on the #testing channel!”\n\n(28:07 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1687]) You mentioned in your interview\nwith Cryptoguard that you were excited about future use-cases, features, and\nDapps for Particl. Do you have any idea on top of your head you can share?\n“I’ve actually been discussing with Cryptoguard in private chats the other day\nideas we and other people from the community and team have had over time.\nThere’s a couple of them floating around, but currently, the main focus really\nis about getting the marketplace up and we need to push that hard. We’re\nhesitant to mention anything specific at the moment because we don’t want to\nswitch the focus on other stuff.\n\nWhat really excites me in that regard though is that there are many ideas out\nthere that would be possible to implement. Getting ideas from the community is\nwhat we need to go forward, and is a great mental exercise to identify what we\nneed to focus on next after the marketplace. For the moment, I won’t elaborate\ntoo much and keep that for after the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace!”\n\n(30:44 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=1844]) What are your thoughts on the\npotential of the coming developer SDK? How do you see Particl as a decentralized\nand privacy-focused economy rather than just a currency?\n“That’s extremely important to have that baseline of privacy, and then\neverything built on top of that is beneficial. Getting the community involved as\nwell, in the long run, is going to really push the project forward and will\nprobably be the driver for mass adoption. There’s already going to be the\nmarketplace available, but taking it beyond that is really going to transform\nthe GUI (Particl Desktop) into essentially a platform with a similar approach to\na plugin-based platform architecture. Whether future Dapps and features are\ndeveloped by us or by the community…I really believe this is going to be the\ndriving force for mass adoption!”\n\n(33:30 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=2010]) Has Particl been your introduction\nto blockchain development?\n“My very very first introduction to cryptocurrencies was back in 2011–2012 when\nI first heard about it. I didn’t really know about it at the time and kind of\npushed it to the side to see what would happen before I do anything about it.\nThen, one of the companies I was working with started to look into crypto and\nthat’s when I really could evaluate what was happening in the space. That’s\naround the time I first bought Bitcoin as well as some other coins. But strictly\nrelated to actual development, yes, Particl is my first crypto project as a\ndeveloper.”\n\n(36:07 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=2167]) What’s your favorite topping on\na pizza?\n“I’m born carnivorous, so any kind of meat is welcomed on pizza, especially\nbacon! Also, I’m in the more controversial side of the debate…but pineapple can\ndefinitely work on a pizza.”\n\n(39:01 [https://youtu.be/NALsvLzdMFE?t=2341]) Paul, Does Particl plans on\ncreating a two-token system to reduce the volatility of funds held in escrow?\n“There’s no immediate plan for this. That being said, that doesn’t it won’t ever\nhappen, but as Arnold said, it’s important to focus on one thing at a thing and\nnot spread ourselves too thin, otherwise, lots of stuff get started but few of\nthem actually get finished up. We are actually going to consider various\nsolutions to reduce volatility and a two-token system might be part of the\nsolution, but it’s not part of the current roadmap.”\n\n(41:46) Will the official website be updated in time for the mainnet release of\nthe marketplace?\n“Yes, the website is constantly in evolution since we launched Particl. We’re\nalso in contact with HackerBay, a German-based company focused on communication\nand marketing, among other things, to help improve the way our message is being\ncommunicated.\n\nWe are currently working on a page specifically made for the marketplace and\nwill update the rest of the website accordingly.”\n\n—\n\nIf you want to read more questions and answers from Arnold, please head over to\nthe link below and read Cryptoguard’s interview with him!\n\nInterview with Arnold Bansemer, Particl Desktop’s Lead Developer\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-arnold-bansemer-particl-desktops-lead-developer-9eb923294826]\nBack in August, the Particl team was very excited to welcome Arnold Bansemer as\nthe new Particl Desktop Lead Developer…\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-arnold-bansemer-particl-desktops-lead-developer-9eb923294826]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-arnold-bansemer-particl-desktops-lead-developer-9eb923294826]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nNew Team Member Joins the Rank\nLast weekend, we’ve teased pictures of a mystery woman hanging out with Miguel\nCuneta [https://twitter.com/MiguelCuneta/status/1056727461990289409], CCO and\nCo-Founder at Satoshi Citadel Industries and Particl advisor. Now’s the time to\nreveal a bit more about Lina, Particl’s newest team member!\n\n> Originally from Germany, Lina is a former\nYoutube-singer-turned-blockchain-advocate — with a few stations in\nbetween.Scouted online by a Japanese artist, she made the move to Asia to\nundergo extensive studies in music, language, and business administration,\neventually turning to the latter to become chief manager at a Kuala Lumpur-based\nmanagement company. Her entrance into the blockchain industry came through her\nposition as the PR Manager and Evangelist for a Tokyo-founded cryptocurrency\nhedge fund platform where she would break down language barriers launching\nglobal roadshows and marketing activities.\n\nHer extensive experience in PR management and event organization is going to\nhelp the project a lot. Particl will also benefit from her skills as a public\nspeaker, writer, event organizer, and much more. We are already bouncing many\nevent ideas and, with Lina, you can expect Particl to start gaining more “boots\non the ground” exposure at conferences and meetups all around the world!\n\nLina will introduce herself to the community next week with a video, you\ndefinitely want to keep your eyes open for that!\n\nStatus Report Updated\nParticl.io — StatusReport [http://particl.io/status-report/]\nParticl is an open source, decentralized privacy platform. Built for global\nperson to person and business to person… [http://particl.io/status-report/]\nparticl.io [http://particl.io/status-report/]\n\nWhile the team is currently mostly busy working on finalizing the governance\nsystem with coin weights, building the private markets, and fixing the various\nissues identified by community testers of the last Particl Marketplace Alpha\nbuild, an interesting item has popped up in the newest Status Report: the\nability to view a list of reported items to cast a vote. This feature will allow\nusers to quickly access listings that have previously been flagged by other\nusers and either vote them as undesirable or not undesirable. This should\nincrease the number of votes cast, thus making the reporting more accurate.\n\nzDEX Alpha is Live With Particl\nzDEX, a privacy-focused decentralized exchange using PIVX’s second-tier network,\nhas launched its Alpha (testnet) version with Particl as one of its 6 first\ncoins to be made available. Make sure to visit zDEX’s website\n[http://www.zdex.exchange/] and test this promising exchange!\n\nSupply lock up\nIn the last few weeks, there have been interesting discussions on Discord and\nTelegram as to how Particl’s MAD escrow system is going to reduce the\ncirculating supply of the PART coin.\n\nIn fact, as the escrow system generally requires the buyer to pay for an item,\nmake a security deposit equal to the value of the purchased order, and have the\nvendor also make an equal-value security deposit, it can be estimated that, in\naverage, three times the value of an item is locked in escrow for a certain\nduration (until both parties agree the transaction is done).\n\nIf we are to estimate that an escrow could take on average 14 days to complete\n(the time it takes to process, package, ship, and receive an order), then it is\npossible to estimate the total amount of money, in PART, locked out of\ncirculation at any given time.\n\nTo not miss any of these interesting discussions, join our of our chatrooms on\neither Discord, Telegram, or Riot. As all chat platforms are linked together, it\ndoesn’t matter which one you join as you’ll be connected to the rest of the\ncommunity automatically, so pick the one you prefer!\n\nparticl.page\nSome members from the community have started a fan website for Particl and have\nbeen teasing its content for the past few days.\n\nThey have revealed on the 26th of October a gorgeous and thorough statistics\npage to keep track of all Particl-related data and metrics, and are promising\nmore interesting features to their website in the near future\n\nWhat do you think they have planned for the community?

It’s a bit difficult to put into perspective because there’s a lot of work to be done, but we’re also moving as fast as we can given the size of the team. I don’t see, however, any particular aspect of the project that is specifically behind other aspects or being neglected. We’re still on track to wrap up governance this month, and probably get Beta ready for the next month or so. One thing we gotta be careful about though is to finish what we start working on first before implementing new features/functions, or else it becomes hard to finish things up properly.

Kewde, who used to assume that role, has\nbeen moved over to Particl Core to work together with Tecnovert on some\ncryptography and core related tasks.\n\nMore widely known as zaSmilingIdiot [https://github.com/zaSmilingIdiot] within\nthe community, as per Arnold’s Github username, he has impressed quite a few\npeople by his development methodologies and insightful Github posts. Following\non lots of requests from the community, I’ve sat down earlier this week with\nArnold to run a small interview and give him the opportunity to introduce\nhimself to the community.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCould you give a small resume of your professional journey?\n> I started out doing what essentially would be IT Support for a couple of months\nbefore moving on to a more technical role with some development work, to\neventually doing full-time dev work. I cut my teeth with Java, and then jumped\nship to Python when the product I was involved with at the time started making\nthe move to becoming a Javascript-based platform instead. At the time I had no\nlove or want of involvement in JS. How things change…Interestingly, the company\nI had migrated to were doing some decent work with putting together their UI’s,\nand my interest piqued and I figured that javascript couldn’t be so bad after\nall (although, to clarify, I believe I might have had a tainted perspective\ngiven my previous exposure to Java). So I started becoming more actively\ninvolved in that side of things. Fast forward a few years, and while getting\nsome exposure to Ruby and Golang along the way, I’ve been pretty much involved\nin JS projects the entire time.\nFor the most part, I’ve always worked in smaller companies, although most have\nhad business/involvement with some more well-known international brands. Its\nbeen pretty amazing to know that some of what I’ve been involved with is being\nused/promoted by some larger companies and, in some cases, had a direct impact\non them. I’ve picked up some great insight into multiple industries along the\nway, from project management, IT security, mining, gambling/entertainment,\ninfrastructure management spaces, and now in the blockchain space.\n…and here we are today :)\n\nHow did you get to join Particl?\n> My brother-in-law knows Ryno, and he mentioned that he was involved with a\nnumber of projects, and that I could always apply and try to find work there if\nI wanted. I didn’t really give it much thought until Ryno got in touch with me.\nWe chatted, I had an interview and then got an offer :) In all honesty, I almost\nnever accepted, but then saw the error of my ways and quickly changed my answer!\nWhat makes you the most excited about Particl?\n> The privacy aspect is definitely a very strong contender, and I think having a\nfocus on privacy is a great baseline. We also have a great team that is skilled\nin bringing the current vision to life. So, generally, I think there is are some\nexciting times ahead already.However, in my opinion, the future potential use\ncases for Particl is what I’m most excited about. I personally see a couple of\napplications for it in the future, and it’s going to be exciting to see what\nsuggestions and integrations come through.\n\nObligatory question: Where does your ZaSmilingIdiot Github username come from?\n> Its actually a name I’ve used in gaming circles: I don’t play too much but when\nI do I’m purely in it for the fun of it. So it’s more about laughing at my own\n(usual) noobiness. Its also probably closer to being the antithesis of how I\nfeel I really am… so there’s that as well! But mostly, it’s about just having\nfun and not caring what others think of me.\nWhat is the biggest challenge you foresee with Particl?\n> I see two (my own, very likely uninformed, opinions).Firstly, in the general\ncrypto space, on-boarding users to make use of the various applications and\nproducts is the one I’m most concerned about at the moment. In terms of Particl\nand the marketplace, this translates to the idea that the average user wanting\nto purchase something online can quickly and conveniently sign in/up to a\nregular online store, and complete a purchase in a few minutes using the fiat\ncurrency already available to them. On the crypto side of the fence, unless the\nuser is already holding a certain amount of the coin of choice and has the app\nalready synced, it requires that the user follow a more complicated process.\nThis means the average mainstream buyer is likely to, at least at first, stick\nwith their current online store purchases due to convenience and ease of\ncompleting the process. A lack of buyers is also not encouraging for sellers to\nuse the platform, and so slow uptake from both sides from more mainstream users\nis likely going to slow the adoption speed. This is of course slowly changing\nand there seems to be some progress in getting cryptocurrency more “mainstream”.\nWhich is a great thing, and having the platforms like Particl marketplace\navailable to help drive this change is crucial. Of course, when we’re at the\npoint that cryptocurrency is used to buy and sell items at the cake sale down\nthe road, then we’re well and truly long past this concern. But until that\nhappens, finding unique ways to attract both buyers and sellers to the platform\nis going to be the bigger challenge.\nAgain, this is something that I see as more of a larger problem that affects\nmost other projects as well, and so keeping an eye on other projects and how\nthey solve it might allow us to generate some unique ideas of own. :D\nThe second challenge relates to the inclusion of future dApps. I’d personally\nlike to see the Desktop evolve into a platform for future dApp inclusion,\npossibly allowing for community built “plugins” that users can apply at will. I\nthink it would really take the product forward as a whole, but it’s (maybe\nfortunately :) ) not up to me. If we did ever want to progress in this\ndirection, I think we’re going to have to think about how to effectively\nstructure such a platform that keeps the privacy and decentralization aspect of\nParticl intact, without falling into the trap of becoming like any other\n(currently centralized) platform.\n\nWhat is your specific role in Particl Desktop? In other words, what is a typical\nday for you working for Particl.\n> I think it’s fairly typically a developer type of role, or what most people\nfamiliar with dev roles would expect it to be! Typically, this involves writing\ncode and/or reviewing code changes. So more than likely I’ll be the one\nreviewing pull requests and doing the code merges. Which also means running\nthrough and testing a feature/bug fix so that it does what it’s meant to do. I\nthen try to be involved in responding to Github issues, and also where possible,\ntry to assist with anything that prevents another dev from doing their job.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt does look like Arnold is going to be a great asset to Particl, and it’s safe\nto say that the entire team is pretty excited about him! I’d like to thank\nArnold for the time taken to generously answer these questions and for his\ndedicated work for Particl.

This is of course slowly changing and there seems to be some progress in getting cryptocurrency more “mainstream”. Which is a great thing, and having the platforms like Particl marketplace available to help drive this change is crucial. Of course, when we’re at the point that cryptocurrency is used to buy and sell items at the cake sale down the road, then we’re well and truly long past this concern.

Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\nIs Making a Listing Pool for Vendors to Make Their First Listings Free Possible?\nTo fight off spammers, all Particl listings require users to submit a small\nlisting fee. This feature is important in fighting off spam as it makes it\nunprofitable for the attacker to do so, at least when done on a larger scale.\nTaking the listing fee out of the equation would leave an opportunity for\nspammers to mess with the network and potentially even defraud the funds\ncontained in the “Free Listing Pool”. Note that we’re currently going over many\nstrategies to help with and kickstart the adoption of the coming marketplace and\nthat we are aware a strategy needs to be adopted to not end up with a difficult\n“Chicken and Egg” problem that is observable sometimes with other marketplaces,\ndecentralized or not.\n\nWhen is the Marketplace Coming on Mainnet?\nParticl Marketplace Alpha (Early October Version)Particl Marketplace Alpha is\nalready out, though it is a testnet-only version. We’ve also released new builds\nthis week that shows the good progress being made on it. If you want to test it\nout, scroll down to the News & Updates section of this Community Update to find\nthe link to the blog post containing the builds.\n\nThe requirements for Particl Marketplace to be released on mainnet is mainly\ndecentralized governance, which is almost ready and can be tested on testnet,\nand RingCT, which has been ready ever since we launched Particl. Other features\nsuch as private markets and private listings are also scheduled for the first\nversion of the marketplace and are well under development. Finally, the testnet\nBeta version of the marketplace (which should contain most, if not all, of the\nmainnet features) should be super stable and devoid of notable bugs.\n\nAs we have three separate development teams (Core, Marketplace, and Desktop),\neach of them working on specific aspects of the Particl platform, giving\ndeadlines is difficult because there are a lot of moving pieces, each one of\nthem having the potential to affect other pieces. Ideally, we’re looking for the\nmonth of November/December for the release of Particl Marketplace Beta, which\nwill also be a testnet version, although that is not a fixed date or deadline of\nany kind. Rest assured that we will take the appropriate steps to let everyone\nknow when we are about to release on mainnet and promote this milestone event as\nit should.\n\nWhen’s the RingCT Hardfork?\nRingCT has been ready for mainnet ever since we launched Particl, but we’ve\ndecided to instead have it properly audited and reviewed to make sure our\nimplementation of it, the first ever done on any other codebase other than\nCryptonote, was secure and trustworthy. As such, we’ve had the implementation\nacademically reviewed by the NJIT Department of Technology and audited by WSA.\nNote that WSA is currently undergoing a second, more thorough audit of the code\nas they requested.\n\nThe requirements for RingCT to be put on mainnet is for the governance system to\nbe fully completed. Similarly to our first hardfork which moved cold staking on\nmainnet, we will likely give a 4-week notice to the community prior to doing it.\nThis should give enough time for most Particl users to be aware of that fact and\nupdate their node in time. This process should be made much easier by the fact\nthat both Particl Desktop and Partyman clients have built-in features to either\nautomatically update Particl Core or block access to features until it is\nupdated to the latest version.\n\nAny plans on Presenting/Attending Events?\nYes. The entire team is going to meet in South Africa during the month of\nNovember for our quarterly team summit. Usually, this summit is mostly focused\non development strategies. This time, however, we’re also bringing the\nCommunications Team over to strategize the future and, most importantly, the\nroad to Particl Marketplace’s mainnet release. This is going to be a milestone\nmeeting for the team as it is going to be the first time most of the team is\ngoing to be at the same place, at the same time. This should prove to be a great\nopportunity to really nail down the launch strategy and get everybody on sync.\n\nOne of the important and main topics that will be discussed during this series\nof meetings is going to be our presence at conferences and getting more exposure\nwithin the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry itself. For example, we’d like\nto organize a launch party at a popular cryptocurrency conference that we’d be\nsponsoring. The idea would be to present Particl Marketplace to a wide audience\nand then end the presentation by actually launching mainnet live. We have a lot\nof similar ideas brewing up, and we’re very excited to be able to meet in person\nin November and really finalize that launch strategy.\n\nWe’ve also started to support ambassadors and initiatives from the community as\nit relates to meetups. As we mentioned in the last Community Update, we’ve had\ncommunity member JoaquimF organize a meetup in São Paulo, Brazil, and we’ve also\nreceived a LOT of interest from our French community for a France-based meetup\nwhich is already in the works.\n\nIt’s also important to note that, as the Particl Foundation has been extremely\ndiligent and careful with their funds, we’ll have the resources required to\nproperly plan and fund our Particl Marketplace launch strategy. We’ll have more\ndetails about it once we come back from our week of meetings in South Africa.\n\nWhat Efforts are Made to Attract a Public Figure for Particl?\nAt the moment, we are not actively looking for a public speaker or figure to\nrepresent Particl. This may end up being part of our marketing strategy after we\nraise funds through our Primary Funding Round, but is not a short-term focus.\n\nThat being said, Particl is a true open-source project and as such, we strongly\nencourage anyone from the community to step up. We’ll offer support to any\nserious community member looking to represent Particl at public events, be it\nlocal meetups or conferences. If you are a good public speaker and want to step\nup, don’t hesitate to contact us and we’ll make sure to find ways to involve\nyou!\n\nWill There Be a Launch Event?\nAbsolutely! We’d like to sponsor a main event for a big conference where we’d be\nlaunching the marketplace on mainnet live. I’d be a great way to reveal the\nmarketplace to a large audience and get exposure from big players, investors,\nand cryptocurrency enthusiasts. We have a lot of ideas for this launch event and\nwe are quite excited to craft an exciting and fun launch strategy. The mainnet\nrelease of Particl Marketplace is a huge milestone for the Particl project, and\nwe want to make the launch event as big as the release is.\n\nAre Efforts Being Made to Create a Particl Documentary?\nNot at this time.\n\nIs Particl’s Treasurer Buying PART at These Prices?\nNo. The Particl team doesn’t hold any coin, the Particl Foundation does. The\nFoundation cannot trade coins speculatively. Moreover, all of the Foundation’s\naccounts are known and publicly auditable, and any transaction can be tracked.\n\nWill Particl Consider Changing its Setup and Switch to a Two-Token Mechanism?\nWe have no plan to do so at the moment, but as our team is constantly looking\nfor improvements, it may come at a later time in our roadmap if that ever makes\nsense to do so. In other words, we are not against it, but it is not within our\nshort-term vision or requirements for the moment.\n\nWill Ryno be Actively Coding on Particl?\nAs Ryno said himself earlier this year during our livestream, he is now more\ninvolved in the management side of things rather than the coding side of thing.\nHe puts in a lot of work for the project right now and oversees that both the\ndevelopment and the business management/organizational side of the project goes\non smoothly. He’s a big part of the core team and an important decision maker.\n\nWhen Will the BitcoinTalk Thread be Updated?\nIt’s one of our backlog items, and we have to pick which item we want to tackle\nfirst on a priority basis. As BitcoinTalk isn’t as popular as it used to be,\nwe’re focusing on stuff that is more urgent in the short-term and stuff we think\nwill have a more important impact on the project. We are aware the thread header\nneeds to be updated, and it will come once we reach that item after tackling\nmore important tasks.\n\nWe again strongly encourage and support community members stepping up and\noffering help. If you want to contribute, let us know, it helps a ton!\n\nDoes Particl Plan on Getting on More Exchanges?\nYes, especially decentralized exchanges. We are working on new exchange deals\nright now and are looking at bigger exchanges like Circle, CoinBase, Binance, a\nhandful of long-standing ones. It is important for us each exchange on which we\nwant to be listed is approved by our legal team and that they be larger, more\nestablished exchange. Exchanges do reach out to us from time to time, ask\npointed questions, but in the end, there are always two parties involved.\nThere’s also a lot of research being done on our end for each exchange,\nincluding looking at how other coins are doing on this exchange, how it\nbenefited them, looking at if the volume is legit or faked, and etc.\n\nIt does look like the mindset of some exchanges is changing and we are hopeful\nthey are starting to look and list valuable projects that will benefit the space\nrather than any ICO able to pay for listing fees.\n\nHave Funds Been Made Available for the Binance Application?\nNo, funds have not been made available for any exchange including Binance, but\neach exchange is a case-by-case and every proposal from serious exchanges is\nbeing considered. Getting on smaller exchanges, however, especially when those\nask for a listing fee, is not something we are interested in as we do not\nbelieve the impact to be big enough for Particl.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nNew Testnet Marketplace Builds Available\nMarketplace | Community Test Build 2018–10–16\n[https://particl.news/marketplace-community-test-build-2018-10-16-b2a9fd913a3c]\nParticl development teams have been hard at work adding additional features and\ninterface experiences to Particl…\n[https://particl.news/marketplace-community-test-build-2018-10-16-b2a9fd913a3c]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/marketplace-community-test-build-2018-10-16-b2a9fd913a3c]\n\nListing governance has been added to the marketplaceOn Tuesday, we released new\nmarketplace testnet builds.

A few items have been moved around and some\nwere added to the report. For example, the report shows a new Particl Desktop\nfeature, adjustable ring size value, is now completed. It also shows that all of\nthe Settings features have now been moved to the Waiting for Review category,\nmeaning they are just about to be included in future public testnet builds.\n\nPrivate MarketsOne quite interesting development in the past two weeks have been\nthe layouts for the coming private markets and listings feature that will be\nincluded in the first mainnet version of Particl Marketplace. A screenshot of\nthe Private Markets page has been shared this week, and more exist. We will\nrelease more of them when we are sure that they aren’t going to be changed\nbefore actual implementation.\n\nParticl Core 0.17.0.2 is Out — Fixes Ledger Issues for MacOS Users\nParticl Core 0.17.0.2 Released — Fixes Ledger Issues on MacOS\n[https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-2-released-fixes-ledger-issues-on-macos-6d9af9f7fe50]\nYesterday, we released Particl Core 0.17.0.2, an update that fixes\nLedger-related issues some MacOS users have been…\n[https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-2-released-fixes-ledger-issues-on-macos-6d9af9f7fe50]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-2-released-fixes-ledger-issues-on-macos-6d9af9f7fe50]\n\nWe’ve also released on the same Particl Core 0.17.0.2, an update that fixes\nLedger-related issues some MacOS users have been experiencing.\n\nIn other words, you shouldn’t have any issue anymore when trying to use your\nLedger hardware device on MacOS.

This feature is important in fighting off spam as it makes it unprofitable for the attacker to do so, at least when done on a larger scale. Taking the listing fee out of the equation would leave an opportunity for spammers to mess with the network and potentially even defraud the funds contained in the “Free Listing Pool”. Note that we’re currently going over many strategies to help with and kickstart the adoption of the coming marketplace and that we are aware a strategy needs to be adopted to not end up with a difficult “Chicken and Egg” problem that is observable sometimes with other marketplaces, decentralized or not.</p><h3 id=\"when-is-the-marketplace-coming-on-mainnet\"><strong>When is the Marketplace Coming on Mainnet?</strong></h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--9/1-HwPakrwxuZXK7Viru1THcQ.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl Marketplace Alpha (Early October Version)</figcaption></figure><p>Particl Marketplace Alpha is already out, though it is a testnet-only version. We’ve also released new builds this week that shows the good progress being made on it. If you want to test it out, scroll down to the <em>News &#x26; Updates </em>section of this Community Update to find the link to the blog post containing the builds.</p><p>The requirements for Particl Marketplace to be released on mainnet is mainly decentralized governance, which is almost ready and can be tested on testnet, and RingCT, which has been ready ever since we launched Particl. Other features such as private markets and private listings are also scheduled for the first version of the marketplace and are well under development. Finally, the testnet Beta version of the marketplace (which should contain most, if not all, of the mainnet features) should be super stable and devoid of notable bugs.</p><p>As we have three separate development teams (Core, Marketplace, and Desktop), each of them working on specific aspects of the Particl platform, giving deadlines is difficult because there are a lot of moving pieces, each one of them having the potential to affect other pieces. Ideally, we’re looking for the month of November/December for the release of Particl Marketplace Beta, which will also be a testnet version, although that is not a fixed date or deadline of any kind. Rest assured that we will take the appropriate steps to let everyone know when we are about to release on mainnet and promote this milestone event as it should.</p><h3 id=\"when-s-the-ringct-hardfork\">When’s the RingCT Hardfork?</h3><p>RingCT has been ready for mainnet ever since we launched Particl, but we’ve decided to instead have it properly audited and reviewed to make sure our implementation of it, the first ever done on any other codebase other than Cryptonote, was secure and trustworthy. As such, we’ve had the implementation academically reviewed by the NJIT Department of Technology and audited by WSA. Note that WSA is currently undergoing a second, more thorough audit of the code as they requested.</p><p>The requirements for RingCT to be put on mainnet is for the governance system to be fully completed. Similarly to our first hardfork which moved cold staking on mainnet, we will likely give a 4-week notice to the community prior to doing it. This should give enough time for most Particl users to be aware of that fact and update their node in time. This process should be made much easier by the fact that both Particl Desktop and Partyman clients have built-in features to either automatically update Particl Core or block access to features until it is updated to the latest version.</p><h3 id=\"any-plans-on-presenting-attending-events\">Any plans on Presenting/Attending Events?</h3><p>Yes. The entire team is going to meet in South Africa during the month of November for our quarterly team summit. Usually, this summit is mostly focused on development strategies. This time, however, we’re also bringing the Communications Team over to strategize the future and, most importantly, the road to Particl Marketplace’s mainnet release. This is going to be a milestone meeting for the team as it is going to be the first time most of the team is going to be at the same place, at the same time. This should prove to be a great opportunity to really nail down the launch strategy and get everybody on sync.</p><p>One of the important and main topics that will be discussed during this series of meetings is going to be our presence at conferences and getting more exposure within the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry itself. For example, we’d like to organize a launch party at a popular cryptocurrency conference that we’d be sponsoring. The idea would be to present Particl Marketplace to a wide audience and then end the presentation by actually launching mainnet live. We have a lot of similar ideas brewing up, and we’re very excited to be able to meet in person in November and really finalize that launch strategy.</p><p>We’ve also started to support ambassadors and initiatives from the community as it relates to meetups. As we mentioned in the last Community Update, we’ve had community member JoaquimF organize a meetup in São Paulo, Brazil, and we’ve also received a LOT of interest from our French community for a France-based meetup which is already in the works.</p><p>It’s also important to note that, as the Particl Foundation has been extremely diligent and careful with their funds, we’ll have the resources required to properly plan and fund our Particl Marketplace launch strategy. We’ll have more details about it once we come back from our week of meetings in South Africa.</p><h3 id=\"what-efforts-are-made-to-attract-a-public-figure-for-particl\">What Efforts are Made to Attract a Public Figure for Particl?</h3><p>At the moment, we are not actively looking for a public speaker or figure to represent Particl. This may end up being part of our marketing strategy after we raise funds through our Primary Funding Round, but is not a short-term focus.</p><p>That being said, Particl is a true open-source project and as such, we strongly encourage anyone from the community to step up. We’ll offer support to any serious community member looking to represent Particl at public events, be it local meetups or conferences. If you are a good public speaker and want to step up, don’t hesitate to contact us and we’ll make sure to find ways to involve you!</p><h3 id=\"will-there-be-a-launch-event\">Will There Be a Launch Event?</h3><p>Absolutely! We’d like to sponsor a main event for a big conference where we’d be launching the marketplace on mainnet live.

Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\nLast week’s livestream was a special edition as we had the great pleasure to\nwelcome Gerlof van Ek, Particl’s Lead Designer, on the livestream as a guest.\n\nGerlof, more commonly known as Crz within the community, has gained valuable\nexperience working for international companies like Disney, Yves Rocher and\nother major design companies. He’s made a name for himself working and\nfreelancing for various successful crypto and blockchain projects such as \nShadowcash, which he co-founded with Ryno and Tecnovert. He has also had a hand\nin EOS (logo/branding), Nexus, CryptoFR [https://cryptofr.com/], BitcoinFR\n[https://bitcoin.fr/], Blocktix, a few exchanges and — of course —Particl, to\nname a few.\n\nGerlof works full-time on Particl, a project he has absolute passion for, and is\nin charge of the branding, GUI design, and much more. For more details about\nGerlof’s journey, watch him break it down on last week’s livestream starting at \n2:10 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=2m10s]!\n\n(10:10 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=10m10s]) Could you please elaborate a bit\non the Bitcoin DDoS bug that was disclosed? How is it possible Particl isn’t\naffected since it’s built on the Bitcoin codebase?\nThe Bitcoin DDoS bug that was recently disclosed about Bitcoin was actually\npretty critical\n[https://medium.com/@jimmysong/bitcoin-core-bug-cve-2018-17144-an-analysis-f80d9d373362]\n, some people even speculating it may have been one of the largest, if not the\nlargest, exploit ever found on Bitcoin. This exploit was inadvertently\nintroduced in Bitcoin Core 0.14 and has been present in all further versions,\nmeaning projects with older versions of the Bitcoin codebase weren’t affected by\nit (for example, PIVX).\n\nAs for Particl, our codebase is always on the heels of Bitcoin Core and is\nsimply not a copy-paste version Bitcoin at some past point in time. Indeed, our\ncore development team is super diligent and focused on security, and this\nvulnerability was spotted long ago by them as they built Particl Confidential\nTransactions on Bitcoin 14.2. In fact, this issue was fixed by our team even\nbefore we went live with our genesis block, meaning Particl has never been\naffected by it at any moment of its history. When we say that security is one of\nour core value, we really mean it, and we have the developers to live up to this\nclaim!.\n\n(13:48 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=13m48s]) Has the Particl UI been designed\nin such a way that will make it easy to apply skins to it?\nYes. Particl Desktop is 100% open-source and users can code their own themes\nusing HTML and CSS. Particl itself is planning on introducing two default themes\n, a light one, which is the current one, and a dark one, for those using Particl\nDesktop at night. We have had an idea where users could go to their Settings\npage and set up their client to automatically change the theme at a specific\ntime of the day, as chosen by the user itself. Additional themes can be coded by\nthe community and might make it to the official repo if they are popular or\nparticularly appreciated by the team.\n\n(15:44 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=15m44s]) Gerlof, it’s been said that\nyou’ve helped other crypto teams with their graphics and branding (such as EOS),\nso with that in mind, what made you choose to join Particl as a team member as\nopposed to any of the other teams you’ve worked with?\nParaphrased: Particl really is my passion and what I consider to be my main\nproject. I absolutely enjoy working on it and taking what was once simply an\nidea to what it is now. I keep wanting to improve it, make it better, and see\nhow far it can go. Another reason I made Particl my full-time project is that we\nhave a super great team composed of genuinely great AND really talented\nindividuals. The atmosphere “behind the scenes” is super positive and\nmotivating, which makes for a great work environment.\n\n(17:39 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=17m39s]) When you first started working\nwith Ryno, was it just the two of you or was Tecnovert, or any other developer,\npart of the initial team?\nParaphrased: We were basically like the three musketeers. We had members come\nand go throughout this journey but us three were basically the core team. The\nvision and scope of the project has severely evolved since we started working on\nit and we found new core members along the way which are now important\ncomponents of Particl. The team has pretty much become a well-oiled machine now\nwith around 15 developers actively working on the project and it is amazing to\nsee!\n\nEverything is carefully planned, and we have daily meetings (sometimes more than\none per day), and the entire project has evolved from a hobby project to a\nreally professional one. Ludx is one great example of a super top quality team\nmember we’ve picked along the way and he’s now working full-time and around the\nclock on Particl, leading the marketplace side of things as well as a lot of the\nbackend stuff. He’s really passionate about Particl and definitely helps taking\nParticl to the next level!\n\n(20:31 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=20m31s]) Will Particl Desktop’s page\neventually default to the marketplace for the sake of usability and mainstream\npotential?\nYes and no… Right now, the wallet is what you see first when you launch Particl\nDesktop, but we do want to redesign/rebuild the Overview page to change it to a\nmore customizable one with the help of Particl widgets. That is because buyers\nand vendors will probably not want to see the same thing when they launch\nParticl Desktop. A vendor might be interested in quickly overviewing their sales\ndata, orders, or inventory whereas a buyer might be more interested in their\npurchasing history or favored items.\n\nSimilarly to regular eCommerce websites, it would be more familiar to shoppers\nif the first thing they see when loading up Particl is a search bar where they\ncan immediately start looking for what they want. Of course, both types of users\nmight be interested in the same data as well such as messages, shipping statues\non ongoing transactions, and so on. This would make the Overview page of Particl\nDesktop a true dashboard.\n\nBecause every user has different needs and expectations, we want Particl Desktop\nto be very customizable. One of the way we aim to attain that customization is\nto have a complete installer that launches the first time you launch the client.\nThis installer will allow users to choose what decentralized applications they\nwant to be included in their personal version of Particl Desktop as well as set\ntheir client up with various parameters and setting options. For example, a user\nmight be only interested in the passive income aspect of Particl, therefore she\ncould disable the marketplace altogether to make the client more lightweight in\nterms of resources. This will be up to the users themselves to choose and design\ntheir most optimal Particl Desktop setup.\n\n> It’s important to understand that Particl is still pretty much in a heavy\ndevelopment phase and mostly a testing environment for now.\nThese are all options we’ve been heavily considering but as with everything\nbeing built alongside blockchain technology, it takes time to develop and\neverything has to be included in a priority queue. We highly recommend users to\ntest the various iterations of Particl Marketplace and Particl Desktop and give\nus as many feedback as possible, either by writing about it in our #testing\n[https://discord.gg/m27aqEq] or #Open-Development [https://discord.gg/7SjzX7Q] \nchannels or directly on the Issues section of Particl Desktop on Github\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues]. It’s important to try\ndifferent approaches at this stage of development and see what works best and\nwhat doesn’t.\n\nParticl-Desktop — Issues [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues]\nParticl Angular GUI — The source for the Particl GUI. — particl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues]\n\n(24:59 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDCzPdVHMJY&feature=youtu.be&t=24m59s])\nIs Particl making plans to have more sponsored ambassadors, per country?\nYes. We’ve had some community members step up already. As a prime example,\nJoaquimF, a Particl fan from Brazil, has been working with us for the past 2 or\n3 weeks to organize a local meetup in Saō Paulo, Brazil. We provided him with a\nton of information as well as some PART coins for the attendees to play with on\nParticl Copay. Additionally, we’ve created flyers both in english and portuguese\nfor the people that are going to be present as well as some custom and exclusive\nt-shirts. Brazil is big on marketplaces in general and we do see this country as\na good place where Particl Marketplace could shine, so with that in mind, we’d\nlike to take this opportunity to thank JoaquimF for his implication and\ngo-getter attitude as well as the effort put in in organizing this these past\nfew weeks!\n\nParticl Meetup in São Paulo, Brazil | Dunas\n[https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde]\nFriday, October 5, 2018\n[https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde]\n\nWe also had motivated folks from the United States, France, Switzerland, and UK\npointing out to us their interest in contributing in a more pro-active way. Note\nthat we will always support and give resources to motivated individuals with a\ndesire to spread the Particl word in the “real world”. We highly encourage\nanyone that wants to step up or have ideas on how to spread the word to contact\nus, either through Paul Schmitzer, Cryptoguard, or any other team member. We’ve\nalso started to take a deeper look into potential conferences, and while it may\nbe hard for us sometimes to make it to these conferences due to the fact that we\nare still in that heavy development phase, we will always consider great\nopportunities. Going to conferences will be something we’ll increasingly be\nlooking for the closer we near to the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace and\nbeyond.\n\n(44:03 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=44m3s]) Is there a limit to the number of\nlistings Particl Marketplace can support?\nNo! There is no upper limit to how many items Particl Marketplace can support!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nNew Particl Core and Particl Desktop Versions Released\nParticl Core 0.17.0.1 and Desktop 1.3 are released\n[https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-1-and-desktop-1-3-are-released-6d1bc3453ea]\nToday, Particl Core 0.17.0.1 was released on the heels of Bitcoin Core 0.17.0\nreleased yesterday.\n[https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-1-and-desktop-1-3-are-released-6d1bc3453ea]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-1-and-desktop-1-3-are-released-6d1bc3453ea]\n\nWe’ve released yesterday two major updates to our clients: Particl Desktop 1.3,\nand Particl Core 0.17.0.1. Both these updates are important, especially for\nParticl Desktop to connect securely to 0.17. This update marks a departure in\nour usual methodology of keeping up-to-date with the Bitcoin codebase a few days\nor weeks after Bitcoin updates its core protocol. This time, we’ve gone ahead a\nreleased it ahead of time.\n\nMost of the changes from Desktop v1.2.3 to v1.3 are cosmetic or bug/issue\nrelated. Most importantly — just like the previous version — users of Desktop\nv1.3 will see an upgrade to the latest Particl Core (0.17.0.1) automatically on\nrestart.\n\n> It is highly recommended for users running Desktop v1.2.2 or earlier to\nimmediately upgrade to Desktop 1.3 in order to be securely communicating with\nCore 0.17.0.1.\nNote: If you have cold staking activated, you will need to update your partyman\napp by navigating to its folder and executing the “git pull” command (without\nthe “ ”). You might also be requested to update your Core node by executing the\n“./partyman update” command (again, without the “ ”).\n\nNew Status Report Out\nParticl.io — StatusReport [https://www.particl.io/status-report]\nParticl provides a decentralized privacy platform with a suite of tools to\nenhance your online privacy * Private… [https://www.particl.io/status-report]\nwww.particl.io [https://www.particl.io/status-report]\n\nAs is now tradition, a new Status Report has been released last Friday just\nbefore we’ve started streaming. While not entirely different from previous\nreports, there are still a few interesting developments worth pointing out. For\none, the report shows that the escrow refactoring and enhancement process has\nbeen completed.\n\nA one week old preview of the current Particl’s testnet environmentThe report\nalso shows the team has started adding coin weight to the governance mechanism,\nmeaning that soon enough, it will work on a 1 coin = 1 vote basis. Implementing\nthe coin weight is a necessary feature of the governance mechanism to help\nfights spammers and only let users with an actual stake in the platform govern\nit. Coin weight also allows anyone, staker or not, to participate in the\ndemocratic process. For an interesting discussion regarding coin weight, visit\nthis forum thread of an archived discussion some community members and Lead\nParticl Marketplace Developer Ludx had last week on Discord/Telegram:\n\nDebate on Decentralized Voting Methodology Optimization\n[https://particl.community/t/debate-on-decentralized-voting-methodology-optimization/306]\nARCHIVED] General Discussion Channel (Discord/Telegram) (28–09–2018) Link:\nhttps://discord.gg/uvSpbQN Lollr: You can’t…\n[https://particl.community/t/debate-on-decentralized-voting-methodology-optimization/306]\nparticl.community\n[https://particl.community/t/debate-on-decentralized-voting-methodology-optimization/306]\n\nAdditionally, following some requests from the community on Telegram, we’ve\nbegun working on a Support & Help tab which will guide and help new users,\nespecially those not very experienced with crypto, in using Particl Desktop.\nThis is directly in line with our mission to make the Particl platform as easy\nto use as possible, even for non-techy individuals. Another item we’ve started\nworking on is a small tweak to the Community Proposals system to make its\nlifecycle based on a time measure rather than a block measure.\n\nAs usual, Particl is still under heavy development and there are a lot of code\nbeing refactored to make it more efficient as well as making the experience\nsmoother and more user-friendly. To get more details about the development\nprogress, please refer to our Status Report [http://particl.io/status-report].\n\nNoteworthy Github Activity\nAside from the Status Report, Github [http://github.com/particl] is always the\nbest place to keep yourself up-to-date with all the latest developments.

Once again, we’ve had a very high participation rate with around 90\nsubmissions from 18 different users. As suggested by some community members,\nwe’ve decided to change the rules a little bit and have a jury composed of team\nmembers handpick the best slogans and put them up for vote. This should reduce\n“user fatigue” when confronted with too many options, and hopefully will result\nin a higher voting participation rate.\n\nThe contest ends next Monday, so if you had a slogan in mind and haven’t posted\nit yet, now is the time to do it!\n\nNew Video & Article from CryptoRamble\nThe Startling Secret Between Google and MasterCard — Crypto Ramble — Medium\n[https://medium.com/@cryptoramble/14eb3cfbc172]\nImagine that you are the creator of a useful tool that you think will help\nsociety.

He’s made a name for himself working and freelancing for various successful crypto and blockchain projects such as <strong>Shadowcash</strong>, which he co-founded with Ryno and Tecnovert. He has also had a hand in <strong>EOS </strong>(logo/branding), <strong>Nexus</strong>, <a href=\"https://cryptofr.com/\"><strong>CryptoFR</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://bitcoin.fr/\"><strong>BitcoinFR</strong></a>, <strong>Blocktix</strong>, a few exchanges and — of course — <strong>Particl</strong>, to name a few.</p><p>Gerlof works full-time on Particl, a project he has absolute passion for, and is in charge of the branding, GUI design, and much more. For more details about Gerlof’s journey, watch him break it down on last week’s livestream starting at <a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=2m10s\"><strong>2:10</strong></a>!</p><h3 id=\"-10-10-could-you-please-elaborate-a-bit-on-the-bitcoin-ddos-bug-that-was-disclosed-how-is-it-possible-particl-isn-t-affected-since-it-s-built-on-the-bitcoin-codebase\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=10m10s\">10:10</a>) Could you please elaborate a bit on the Bitcoin DDoS bug that was disclosed? How is it possible Particl isn’t affected since it’s built on the Bitcoin codebase?</h3><p>The Bitcoin DDoS bug that was recently disclosed about Bitcoin was actually pretty <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jimmysong/bitcoin-core-bug-cve-2018-17144-an-analysis-f80d9d373362\">critical</a>, some people even speculating it may have been one of the largest, if not the largest, exploit ever found on Bitcoin. This exploit was inadvertently introduced in Bitcoin Core 0.14 and has been present in all further versions, meaning projects with older versions of the Bitcoin codebase weren’t affected by it (for example, PIVX).</p><p>As for Particl, our codebase is always on the heels of Bitcoin Core and is simply not a copy-paste version Bitcoin at some past point in time. Indeed, our core development team is super diligent and focused on security, and this vulnerability was spotted long ago by them as they built Particl Confidential Transactions on Bitcoin 14.2. In fact, this issue was fixed by our team even before we went live with our genesis block, meaning Particl has never been affected by it at any moment of its history. When we say that security is one of our core value, we really mean it, and we have the developers to live up to this claim!.</p><h3 id=\"-13-48-has-the-particl-ui-been-designed-in-such-a-way-that-will-make-it-easy-to-apply-skins-to-it\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=13m48s\">13:48</a>) Has the Particl UI been designed in such a way that will make it easy to apply skins to it?</h3><p>Yes. Particl Desktop is 100% open-source and users can code their own themes using HTML and CSS. Particl itself is planning on introducing <strong>two default themes</strong>, a light one, which is the current one, and a dark one, for those using Particl Desktop at night. We have had an idea where users could go to their Settings page and set up their client to <strong>automatically change the theme at a specific time of the day</strong>, as chosen by the user itself. Additional themes can be coded by the community and might make it to the official repo if they are popular or particularly appreciated by the team.</p><h3 id=\"-15-44-gerlof-it-s-been-said-that-you-ve-helped-other-crypto-teams-with-their-graphics-and-branding-such-as-eos-so-with-that-in-mind-what-made-you-choose-to-join-particl-as-a-team-member-as-opposed-to-any-of-the-other-teams-you-ve-worked-with\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=15m44s\">15:44</a>) Gerlof, it’s been said that you’ve helped other crypto teams with their graphics and branding (such as EOS), so with that in mind, what made you choose to join Particl as a team member as opposed to any of the other teams you’ve worked with?</h3><p><strong>Paraphrased:</strong> <em>Particl really is my passion and what I consider to be my main project. I absolutely enjoy working on it and taking what was once simply an idea to what it is now. I keep wanting to improve it, make it better, and see how far it can go. Another reason I made Particl my full-time project is that we have a super great team composed of genuinely great AND really talented individuals. The atmosphere “behind the scenes” is super positive and motivating, which makes for a great work environment.</em></p><h3 id=\"-17-39-when-you-first-started-working-with-ryno-was-it-just-the-two-of-you-or-was-tecnovert-or-any-other-developer-part-of-the-initial-team\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=17m39s\">17:39</a>) When you first started working with Ryno, was it just the two of you or was Tecnovert, or any other developer, part of the initial team?</h3><p><strong>Paraphrased: </strong><em>We were basically like the three musketeers. We had members come and go throughout this journey but us three were basically the core team. The vision and scope of the project has severely evolved since we started working on it and we found new core members along the way which are now important components of Particl. The team has pretty much become a well-oiled machine now with around </em><em><strong>15 developers</strong></em><em> actively working on the project and it is amazing to see!</em></p><p><em>Everything is carefully planned, and we have </em><em><strong>daily meetings</strong></em><em> (sometimes more than one per day), and the entire project has evolved from a hobby project to a really professional one. Ludx is one great example of a super top quality team member we’ve picked along the way and he’s now working full-time and around the clock on Particl, leading the marketplace side of things as well as a lot of the backend stuff. He’s really passionate about Particl and definitely helps taking Particl to the next level!</em></p><h3 id=\"-20-31-will-particl-desktop-s-page-eventually-default-to-the-marketplace-for-the-sake-of-usability-and-mainstream-potential\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=20m31s\">20:31</a>) Will Particl Desktop’s page eventually default to the marketplace for the sake of usability and mainstream potential?</h3><p>Yes and no… Right now, the wallet is what you see first when you launch Particl Desktop, but we do want to <strong>redesign/rebuild the Overview page</strong> to change it to a more <strong>customizable</strong> one with the help of <strong>Particl widgets</strong>. That is because buyers and vendors will probably not want to see the same thing when they launch Particl Desktop. A vendor might be interested in quickly overviewing their sales data, orders, or inventory whereas a buyer might be more interested in their purchasing history or favored items.</p><p>Similarly to regular eCommerce websites, it would be more familiar to shoppers if the first thing they see when loading up Particl is a search bar where they can immediately start looking for what they want. Of course, both types of users might be interested in the same data as well such as messages, shipping statues on ongoing transactions, and so on. This would make the Overview page of Particl Desktop a true dashboard.</p><p>Because every user has different needs and expectations, we want Particl Desktop to be <strong>very customizable</strong>. One of the way we aim to attain that customization is to have a complete <strong>installer</strong> that launches the first time you launch the client. This installer will allow users to <strong>choose what decentralized applications they want to be included</strong> in their personal version of Particl Desktop as well as set their client up with various parameters and setting options. For example, a user might be only interested in the passive income aspect of Particl, therefore she could disable the marketplace altogether to make the client more lightweight in terms of resources. <strong>This will be up to the users themselves to choose and design their most optimal Particl Desktop setup</strong>.</p><blockquote>It’s important to understand that Particl is still pretty much in a heavy development phase and mostly a testing environment for now.</blockquote><p>These are all options we’ve been heavily considering but as with everything being built alongside blockchain technology, it takes time to develop and everything has to be included in a priority queue. We highly recommend users to test the various iterations of Particl Marketplace and Particl Desktop and give us as many feedback as possible, either by writing about it in our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/m27aqEq\"><strong>#testing</strong></a> or <a href=\"https://discord.gg/7SjzX7Q\"><strong>#Open-Development</strong></a> channels or directly on the <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\"><strong>Issues section of Particl Desktop on Github</strong></a>. It’s important to try different approaches at this stage of development and see what works best and what doesn’t.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\"><strong>Particl-Desktop — Issues</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\"><em>Particl Angular GUI — The source for the Particl GUI. — particl/particl-desktop</em></a><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\">github.com</a></p><h3 id=\"-24-59-is-particl-making-plans-to-have-more-sponsored-ambassadors-per-country\">(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDCzPdVHMJY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=24m59s\">24:59</a>) Is Particl making plans to have more sponsored ambassadors, per country?</h3><p>Yes. We’ve had some community members step up already. As a prime example, JoaquimF, a Particl fan from Brazil, has been working with us for the past 2 or 3 weeks to organize a local meetup in Saō Paulo, Brazil. We provided him with a ton of information as well as some PART coins for the attendees to play with on Particl Copay. Additionally, we’ve created flyers both in english and portuguese for the people that are going to be present as well as some custom and exclusive t-shirts. Brazil is big on marketplaces in general and we do see this country as a good place where Particl Marketplace could shine, so with that in mind, we’d like to take this opportunity to thank JoaquimF for his implication and go-getter attitude as well as the effort put in in organizing this these past few weeks!</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\"><strong>Particl Meetup in São Paulo, Brazil | Dunas</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\"><em>Friday, October 5, 2018</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\">particl.news</a></p><p>We also had motivated folks from the United States, France, Switzerland, and UK pointing out to us their interest in contributing in a more pro-active way. Note that we will always support and give resources to motivated individuals with a desire to spread the Particl word in the “real world”. We highly encourage anyone that wants to step up or have ideas on how to spread the word to contact us, either through Paul Schmitzer, Cryptoguard, or any other team member. We’ve also started to take a deeper look into potential conferences, and while it may be hard for us sometimes to make it to these conferences due to the fact that we are still in that heavy development phase, we will always consider great opportunities. Going to conferences will be something we’ll increasingly be looking for the closer we near to the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace and beyond.</p><h3 id=\"-44-03-is-there-a-limit-to-the-number-of-listings-particl-marketplace-can-support\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=44m3s\">44:03</a>) Is there a limit to the number of listings Particl Marketplace can support?</h3><p>No! There is no upper limit to how many items Particl Marketplace can support!</p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &amp; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"new-particl-core-and-particl-desktop-versions-released\">New Particl Core and Particl Desktop Versions Released</h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-1-and-desktop-1-3-are-released-6d1bc3453ea\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.0.1 and Desktop 1.3 are released</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-1-and-desktop-1-3-are-released-6d1bc3453ea\"><em>Today, Particl Core 0.17.0.1 was released on the heels of Bitcoin Core 0.17.0 released yesterday.</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-1-and-desktop-1-3-are-released-6d1bc3453ea\">particl.news</a></p><p>We’ve released yesterday two major updates to our clients: Particl Desktop 1.3, and Particl Core 0.17.0.1. Both these updates are important, especially for Particl Desktop to connect securely to 0.17. This update marks a departure in our usual methodology of keeping up-to-date with the Bitcoin codebase a few days or weeks after Bitcoin updates its core protocol. This time, we’ve gone ahead a released it ahead of time.</p><p>Most of the changes from Desktop v1.2.3 to v1.3 are cosmetic or bug/issue related. Most importantly — just like the previous version — users of Desktop v1.3 will see an upgrade to the latest Particl Core (0.17.0.1) <strong>automatically</strong> on restart.</p><blockquote><strong>It is highly recommended for users running Desktop v1.2.2 or earlier to immediately upgrade to Desktop 1.3 in order to be securely communicating with Core 0.17.0.1.</strong></blockquote><p><em><strong>Note: </strong></em><em>If you have cold staking activated, you will need to update your partyman app by navigating to its folder and executing the “</em><em><strong>git pull</strong></em><em>” command (without the “ ”).

This is directly in line with our mission to make the Particl platform as easy to use as possible, even for non-techy individuals. Another item we’ve started working on is a small tweak to the Community Proposals system to make its lifecycle based on a time measure rather than a block measure.</p><p>As usual, Particl is still under heavy development and there are a lot of code being refactored to make it more efficient as well as making the experience smoother and more user-friendly.

Additional themes can be coded by the community and might make it to the official repo if they are popular or particularly appreciated by the team.</p><h3 id=\"-15-44-gerlof-it-s-been-said-that-you-ve-helped-other-crypto-teams-with-their-graphics-and-branding-such-as-eos-so-with-that-in-mind-what-made-you-choose-to-join-particl-as-a-team-member-as-opposed-to-any-of-the-other-teams-you-ve-worked-with\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=15m44s\">15:44</a>) Gerlof, it’s been said that you’ve helped other crypto teams with their graphics and branding (such as EOS), so with that in mind, what made you choose to join Particl as a team member as opposed to any of the other teams you’ve worked with?</h3><p><strong>Paraphrased:</strong> <em>Particl really is my passion and what I consider to be my main project.

We had members come and go throughout this journey but us three were basically the core team. The vision and scope of the project has severely evolved since we started working on it and we found new core members along the way which are now important components of Particl. The team has pretty much become a well-oiled machine now with around </em><em><strong>15 developers</strong></em><em> actively working on the project and it is amazing to see!</em></p><p><em>Everything is carefully planned, and we have </em><em><strong>daily meetings</strong></em><em> (sometimes more than one per day), and the entire project has evolved from a hobby project to a really professional one.

He’s really passionate about Particl and definitely helps taking Particl to the next level!</em></p><h3 id=\"-20-31-will-particl-desktop-s-page-eventually-default-to-the-marketplace-for-the-sake-of-usability-and-mainstream-potential\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=20m31s\">20:31</a>) Will Particl Desktop’s page eventually default to the marketplace for the sake of usability and mainstream potential?</h3><p>Yes and no… Right now, the wallet is what you see first when you launch Particl Desktop, but we do want to <strong>redesign/rebuild the Overview page</strong> to change it to a more <strong>customizable</strong> one with the help of <strong>Particl widgets</strong>. That is because buyers and vendors will probably not want to see the same thing when they launch Particl Desktop. A vendor might be interested in quickly overviewing their sales data, orders, or inventory whereas a buyer might be more interested in their purchasing history or favored items.</p><p>Similarly to regular eCommerce websites, it would be more familiar to shoppers if the first thing they see when loading up Particl is a search bar where they can immediately start looking for what they want. Of course, both types of users might be interested in the same data as well such as messages, shipping statues on ongoing transactions, and so on. This would make the Overview page of Particl Desktop a true dashboard.</p><p>Because every user has different needs and expectations, we want Particl Desktop to be <strong>very customizable</strong>. One of the way we aim to attain that customization is to have a complete <strong>installer</strong> that launches the first time you launch the client. This installer will allow users to <strong>choose what decentralized applications they want to be included</strong> in their personal version of Particl Desktop as well as set their client up with various parameters and setting options. For example, a user might be only interested in the passive income aspect of Particl, therefore she could disable the marketplace altogether to make the client more lightweight in terms of resources. <strong>This will be up to the users themselves to choose and design their most optimal Particl Desktop setup</strong>.</p><blockquote>It’s important to understand that Particl is still pretty much in a heavy development phase and mostly a testing environment for now.</blockquote><p>These are all options we’ve been heavily considering but as with everything being built alongside blockchain technology, it takes time to develop and everything has to be included in a priority queue. We highly recommend users to test the various iterations of Particl Marketplace and Particl Desktop and give us as many feedback as possible, either by writing about it in our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/m27aqEq\"><strong>#testing</strong></a> or <a href=\"https://discord.gg/7SjzX7Q\"><strong>#Open-Development</strong></a> channels or directly on the <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\"><strong>Issues section of Particl Desktop on Github</strong></a>. It’s important to try different approaches at this stage of development and see what works best and what doesn’t.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\"><strong>Particl-Desktop — Issues</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\"><em>Particl Angular GUI — The source for the Particl GUI. — particl/particl-desktop</em></a><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\">github.com</a></p><h3 id=\"-24-59-is-particl-making-plans-to-have-more-sponsored-ambassadors-per-country\">(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDCzPdVHMJY&#x26;feature=youtu.be&#x26;t=24m59s\">24:59</a>) Is Particl making plans to have more sponsored ambassadors, per country?</h3><p>Yes. We’ve had some community members step up already. As a prime example, JoaquimF, a Particl fan from Brazil, has been working with us for the past 2 or 3 weeks to organize a local meetup in Saō Paulo, Brazil. We provided him with a ton of information as well as some PART coins for the attendees to play with on Particl Copay. Additionally, we’ve created flyers both in english and portuguese for the people that are going to be present as well as some custom and exclusive t-shirts. Brazil is big on marketplaces in general and we do see this country as a good place where Particl Marketplace could shine, so with that in mind, we’d like to take this opportunity to thank JoaquimF for his implication and go-getter attitude as well as the effort put in in organizing this these past few weeks!</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\"><strong>Particl Meetup in São Paulo, Brazil | Dunas</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\"><em>Friday, October 5, 2018</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\">particl.news</a></p><p>We also had motivated folks from the United States, France, Switzerland, and UK pointing out to us their interest in contributing in a more pro-active way. Note that we will always support and give resources to motivated individuals with a desire to spread the Particl word in the “real world”. We highly encourage anyone that wants to step up or have ideas on how to spread the word to contact us, either through Paul Schmitzer, Cryptoguard, or any other team member. We’ve also started to take a deeper look into potential conferences, and while it may be hard for us sometimes to make it to these conferences due to the fact that we are still in that heavy development phase, we will always consider great opportunities. Going to conferences will be something we’ll increasingly be looking for the closer we near to the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace and beyond.</p><h3 id=\"-44-03-is-there-a-limit-to-the-number-of-listings-particl-marketplace-can-support\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=44m3s\">44:03</a>) Is there a limit to the number of listings Particl Marketplace can support?</h3><p>No!

Both these updates are important, especially for Particl Desktop to connect securely to 0.17. This update marks a departure in our usual methodology of keeping up-to-date with the Bitcoin codebase a few days or weeks after Bitcoin updates its core protocol. This time, we’ve gone ahead a released it ahead of time.</p><p>Most of the changes from Desktop v1.2.3 to v1.3 are cosmetic or bug/issue related. Most importantly — just like the previous version — users of Desktop v1.3 will see an upgrade to the latest Particl Core (0.17.0.1) <strong>automatically</strong> on restart.</p><blockquote><strong>It is highly recommended for users running Desktop v1.2.2 or earlier to immediately upgrade to Desktop 1.3 in order to be securely communicating with Core 0.17.0.1.</strong></blockquote><p><em><strong>Note: </strong></em><em>If you have cold staking activated, you will need to update your partyman app by navigating to its folder and executing the “</em><em><strong>git pull</strong></em><em>” command (without the “ ”).

Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\n(4:07 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=4m8s]) Is it still the plan to integrate\nChangelly directly within Particl Desktop.\nYes. We still have big plans for Changelly, and we definitely think they will\nhelp a lot make our currency-agnostic vision become reality by providing a wide\narray of coins as well as the liquidity to support each of them. They also\nprovide a great developer API toolkit which will allow us to experiment with a\nlot of what they offer and make the integration that much easier.\n\nAs per our currency-agnostic approach, we are designing Particl Desktop (our\nmain wallet) in such a way that it could easily integrate Changelly, but also\nany other similar service. That means that while we are going to integrate\nChangelly directly within Particl Desktop, we may end up integrating several\nother services, some that may provide different coins, features, and services.\nWe believe that Particl’s agnostic approach will help get the marketplace much\nmore adoption as well as empower other cryptocurrency communities by providing\nthem more utility and a convenient way to spend their coins.\n\n(4:07 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfKSgp5WtJ4&feature=youtu.be&t=4m8s]) Is\nit currently being worked on?\nThe team is currently focused on the development of the Beta version of Particl\nMarketplace and the integration is not being actively worked on right now as it\nhasn’t been identified as a “Beta item”. We’ve also approached Changelly to\ndiscuss including them in one of our testnet iteration of Particl Marketplace,\nbut they do not operate a testnet or test version of their product, so that\nmakes integrating Changelly impossible within any of our testnet version.\n\nDon’t forget that Particl Desktop is still designed in such a way that would\nmake this integration easy to set up and, as we go down the list of priorities,\nthis will be worked on after the release of Particl Marketplace Beta. Being\ncurrency-agnostic is and will stay one of our core vision.\n\nWe would like to mention that it is always possible to see what’s currently\nbeing worked on right and what’s scheduled to be worked on after that by\nchecking out our Status Report [http://particl.io/status-report/] page on \nparticl.io [http://particl.io].\n\n(10:14 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=10m14s]) Can the team make atomic swaps\nmore user-friendly?\nAs it currently stands today, atomic swaps (the trustless coin exchanging\nprotocol) are very rough around the edges and most definitely a bleeding-edge\nway to trade cryptocurrencies mostly reserved for advanced users. There are no\neasy-to-understand guides out there yet, and the number of people willing to\ntrade their coin through atomic swaps is definitely limited for the moment.\n\nAt Particl more precisely, we’ve had atomic swaps ready on mainnet ever since\nOctober 2017, but never really have integrated it into any of our wallets so\nfar. As with everything we do, user-friendliness and making available accessible\nsolutions is one of our top priority, so rest assured that our integration of \natomic swaps will be built in such a way that it can be easily used by anyone\nwithout advanced technical knowledge. It might not be perfect on its first\niteration but just like Particl Desktop, for example, it will keep on getting\nimproved as time goes on and as we receive feedback from users. Considering how\nadvanced and complicated executing atomic swaps currently is though, such an\neasy-to-use integration could take some time until it is officially released on\nmainnet. As for the integration itself, we have been bouncing ideas between two\nsolutions:\n\nDecentralized Exchange Dapp for Particl\n\nIt’s been discussed for some time that we might be interested in building a \ndecentralized exchange based on atomic swaps somewhere in the future. This is\nobviously not an item on our current roadmap, nor is this even guaranteed to\never happen, but it is one of the solutions we discussed as being interesting\nfor the platform.\n\nCheckout Option\n\nHaving the ability to have the users choose what payment method they would like\nto use as part of the checkout process might be a more intuitive way to go about\nit. This is, after all, how most eCommerce platforms and plugins do it. This\nwould not require users to store any coin on Particl Desktop and would be a\nreally user-friendly way to use atomic swaps that resembles how people already\ndo online payments.\n\nDecentralized Exchange Integrations\n\nThere are, however, middle-ground solutions that could be deployed in the\nmeantime. In fact, some projects are currently working on\nChangelly/Shapeshift-like services built using atomic swaps and other\ndecentralized means of exchange. These are, of course, not 100% trustless\nsolutions since most of these atomic swap exchanges use centralized order books\nand order matching systems, but they are still considerably more decentralized\nthan their centralized non-custodial counterparts (i.e. Changelly). They also\npresent themselves as interesting solutions as they will likely offer more\nliquidity than bare bone atomic swaps, and could even be able to be integrated\ninto Particl Desktop either as DEXes or checkout options. Some good examples of\nsuch middle-ground services could be found in Altcoin.io [http://altcoin.io/] \nand AtomicWallet [https://atomicwallet.io/].\n\n(16:58 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=16m58s]) Has the NJIT Department of\nTechnology Reviewed a Potential Weakness with RingCT When it Comes to Low Number\nof Transactions?\nFor some context, this question addresses the potential weakness of privacy\nprotocols when confronted with a low amount of transactions. As a general rule\nof thumb, the more private transactions there are on a given chain, the more\nprivate these transactions are estimated to be. We’ve known this potential issue\nfor some time, in fact, this is a problem every single privacy coins have to\ndeal with. This is one of the reasons the marketplace and RingCT are on parallel\ntracks for mainnet release. Indeed, we strongly believe the number of\nmarketplace transactions (since they will all default to RingCT) coupled with\nnon-marketplace RingCT cryptocurrency transactions will at least maintain a\nsolid anonymity set floor that will get higher as other Particl Dapps then start\nto make their appearance in the future. Because a lot of RingCT-based privacy\ncoins are just that, coins, they rely on one single source of transactions\n(currency transactions) to keep their anonymity set high whereas, with Particl,\nreal-world use-case is very likely to help a lot with the quality of the privacy\non the platform.\n\nThat being said, our RingCT implementation has been academically reviewed by the\nNJIT Department of Technology and they’ve focused on various aspects of the\nprotocol, including how to optimize privacy within various anonymity sets and\nways to improve (or maintain) the overall privacy of the protocol when faced\nwith many potential scenarios.\n\nWe’d also like to reemphasize that privacy, security, and decentralization are\nthree of our core values. We absolutely agree that the marketplace should be as\nprivate and secure as it could potentially be once it launches on mainnet, and\nwe are actively researching and working on implementations to make sure these\nthree core values are respected at any time and with all of Particl’s core\nfeatures.\n\n(22:54 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=22m54s]) Is the team looking into other\nprivacy protocols, and if so, what would be the implementation estimate?\nWe are not looking into other privacy schemes, but Tecnovert is currently\nworking on some RingCT improvements he’s been wanting to implement for some time\nnow. Although no major issue or vulnerability has been detected in both WSA’s \nsecurity audit and NJIT’s academic review, some minor issues might have\nconvinced him that it would be worth it to work on the improvements before we\nproceed with our RingCT + governance hardfork. Although these changes do not\nconstitute an outright change of privacy protocol, they are small improvements\nour developers see the need to fix after over 1 year of testing and outside\nreview. It might be interesting to note that, as Dasource/Shazzy (Particl\nResearch & Development) mentioned, these changes being made to the RingCT scheme\ncould mean that the privacy protocol may not be able to be defined as purely a\nring signature + confidential transaction setup (RingCT) but something a bit\ndifferent. These changes will make the RingCT protocol a more private solution\nand one that is potentially cheaper to use.\n\nThe very first commits related to these RingCT improvements have started\nappearing on Github this week. More details will be communicated at a later\ntime. In the meantime, you can have a look at the work being accomplished by\nTecnovert by following the Particl Core repository’s commit page.\n\nParticl-Core — Commits [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master]\nParticl Core integration/staging tree. Contribute to particl/particl-core\ndevelopment by creating an account on GitHub.\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master]\n\n(26:10 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=26m10s]) Will the team postpone the\nmainnet release of the marketplace in order to make sure Particl’s RingCT\nprivacy is optimal?\nAs mentioned above, privacy is one of our core value and we would not release\nthe marketplace on mainnet until we are fully satisfied with the level of\nprivacy it offers. That being said, we are absolutely confident in the solutions\nand improvements that Tecnovert has identified and started working on, and we\nalso believe that marketplace activity will greatly help with the transaction\npool.\n\nIt’s also very important to note that privacy doesn’t stop at currency\ntransactions. Everything built on Particl is being built with privacy in mind\nand in a constant state of evolution. For example, we are currently making a \nmajor code refactoring of the MAD escrow system which will make it more private \nand again, potentially cheaper to use. Another example of how privacy and\nsecurity are being taken care of at every level of the platform is with the fiat\nprice pegging mechanism. It would be easy to simply integrate some API from\nCoinMarketCap that updates prices every 5 seconds or so, but that would also\nleak some data such as user location based on currency bias that a passive\nobserver could use to start profiling users.\n\nEvery single aspect of Particl Marketplace is built with privacy and security at\nits very core, and all these functions add up in symbiosis and contribute to the\nprivacy factor of the platform. We are in a constant state of research when it\ncomes to security and privacy solutions. As we often say, it’s in our DNA, and\nit is what we are all about!\n\n(28:33 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=28m33s]) When is marketing going to\nkick up?\nInternally, the preparations for the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace has\nalready started. This week, our marketing/comm team has moved to Jira, just like\nour developer team has done earlier this summer. In fact, adopting agile\nmethodologies has made a tremendous difference and helped our dev team a lot in\nattaining better productivity as well as intra-team communication efficiency,\nand we are looking forward to applying this same approach to our marketing/comm\nteam. We’ve also been reshuffling some of our resources, are reviewing our\nbudget, have started contacting some of the people we identify as key people for\nthe launch, and have started drafting various documents and strategies to ensure\nthat Particl Marketplace’s launch is done properly.\n\n(35:11 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=35m11s]) Did Qiang Tang work on private\nlistings for Particl Marketplace?\nNo, this is not part of what they reviewed.\n\n(35:45 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=35m45s]) How much time would it take the\nteam to release private listings on testnet?\nOur team’s goal is to have Particl Marketplace Beta ready by the end of the\nyear, so working back from that point private listings should be released on\ntestnet within that timeframe. Private listings are probably not as critical of\na feature as RingCT and governance, and while we do want this feature to be part\nof the mainnet release, it might also make its appearance on testnet after Beta.\nThe marketplace has, however, been designed with this very feature in mind, and\nthe word from our developers is that it should be relatively easy and quick to\nimplement.\n\nAs with everything, Particl is a project with a lot of moving targets and the\norder and timeframe at which features are released can vary greatly depending on\na multitude of factors.\n\n(37:01 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=37m1s]) If the governance mechanism and\nRingCT work fine, would the marketplace potentially be pushed to mainnet even\nthough all the items identified as Beta items aren’t ready yet?\nAs mentioned above, the two main items required for Beta are the governance\nsystem and RingCT. Other features will also most likely be part of the mainnet\nrelease, although it could be debated whether to include them or not at first if\nthey are not ready and we are “in an urge” to release the marketplace.\n\n(38:14 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=38m14s]) Could we at least have one guest\nper AMA/FAQ Livestream to show the project from another perspective?\nYes, we fully agree. Our developers are very busy with the coding part of the\nmarketplace but it would be great to get more guests from time to time. Some of\nour best livestreams happened with some of our developers on. It might be\npossible that for the next livestream we’ll be joined by our Lead Graphic\nDesigner CRZ.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nParticl Desktop 1.2.3 Released\nParticl Desktop 1.2.3 Release\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673]\nRecently, most of the Particl Desktop application development has been focused\non the marketplace, but its wallet…\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673]particl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673]\n\nWe released on the 12th of September Particl Desktop 1.2.3\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.2.3], a major update\non the mainnet wallet capabilities of Particl Desktop. A majority of its user\ninterface has been improved upon as well as made more user-friendly, and a lot\nof bug fixes and stability improvements were implemented to make the Particl\nDesktop experience as smooth as it has ever been!

There are some interesting updates, such as the RingCT\nimplementation (enhancements) and the modification currently being done to the\ngovernance system. In fact, the development team is switching the measurement of\nthe voting period duration on community proposals from a block height base to a\ntime base. It is also possible to see that some of the items related to the\nSettings tab have been moved over to the Review section.\n\nYou may have noticed that on pretty much every Status Reports, there are\nmentions of code refactoring. Indeed, Particl is leading-edge protocol in terms\nof technology, and a lot of what’s being accomplished has never been done in the\npast. While this is most definitely exciting, it is also challenging for our\ndevelopers as there is very little to compare to or use as a comparative figure.\nThis means that, while they are simultaneously building various pieces of the\nParticl puzzle, they might, along the way, figure out better, more efficient\nways to code some stuff. This is what’s called a code refactoring.\n\n> The process of restructuring existing computer code — changing the\nfactoring — without changing its external behavior. Refactoring improves\nnonfunctional attributes of the software. —Wikipedia\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring]\nYou can expect a lot of code refactoring this year as we keep on improving the\nParticl platform and its infrastructure in order to make as smooth, efficient, \npleasant to use, but most importantly, secure and private as possible.\n\nCold Staking Sneak Peek\n> \nWe published last Friday a sneak peek of Tecnovert’s cold staking pool. While it\nis still unclear how exactly this pool will be released, once it does it will\nallow users to delegate their staking powers to a cold staking pool that will\nhave the ability to manage payouts. This means a user with only a few PART coins\ncould receive payouts in smaller increments than a~1.25 PART; Particl’s current\nstaking reward amount. This is a great achievement for our project as that\nheavily reduces the barrier of entry to staking, meaning no one gets left behind\nbased on monetary values.\n\nWe will have more information about the cold staking pool as we near its launch.\n\nCommunity Proposals Make Their Way onto Particl’s Testnet\nAs announced in our last Community Update #6\n[https://particl.news/community-update-6-3ead71971cfe], the governance mechanism\nfor the Community Proposals as seen its first iteration make its way onto\ntestnet. We have now released proper builds to test the feature and anyone in\nthe community can now fire up their testnet Particl Desktop client and test the\nnew feature. We highly suggest that you report any issue you encounter during\nyour testing either in our #testing channel on Discord/Telegram or directly on \nGithub [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] as that helps us fix\nthem more quickly.\n\nNote 1: The marketplace currently does not include any governance tool. The\ngovernance mechanism has only been fully integrated into Community Proposals.\nThe marketplace integration of this mechanism is currently underway and will\ncome in a later update.\n\nNote 2: The testnet is currently on hold and not loading properly.

There are no easy-to-understand guides out there yet, and the number of people willing to trade their coin through atomic swaps is definitely limited for the moment.</p><p>At Particl more precisely, <strong>we’ve had atomic swaps ready on mainnet ever since October 2017</strong>, but never really have integrated it into any of our wallets so far. As with everything we do, user-friendliness and making available accessible solutions is one of our top priority, so rest assured that our integration of <strong>atomic swaps</strong> will be built in such a way that it can be easily used by anyone without advanced technical knowledge. It might not be perfect on its first iteration but just like Particl Desktop, for example, it will keep on getting improved as time goes on and as we receive feedback from users. Considering how advanced and complicated executing <strong>atomic swaps</strong> currently is though, such an easy-to-use integration could take some time until it is officially released on mainnet. As for the integration itself, we have been bouncing ideas between two solutions:</p><p><strong>Decentralized Exchange Dapp for Particl</strong></p><p>It’s been discussed for some time that we might be interested in building a <strong>decentralized exchange based on atomic swaps</strong> somewhere in the future. This is obviously not an item on our current roadmap, nor is this even guaranteed to ever happen, but it is one of the solutions we discussed as being interesting for the platform.</p><p><strong>Checkout Option</strong></p><p>Having the ability to have the users choose what payment method they would like to use <strong>as part of the checkout process</strong> might be a more intuitive way to go about it. This is, after all, how most eCommerce platforms and plugins do it. This would not require users to store any coin on Particl Desktop and would be a really user-friendly way to use atomic swaps that resembles how people already do online payments.</p><p><strong>Decentralized Exchange Integrations</strong></p><p>There are, however, middle-ground solutions that could be deployed in the meantime. In fact, some projects are currently working on Changelly/Shapeshift-like services built using atomic swaps and other decentralized means of exchange. These are, of course, not 100% trustless solutions since most of these atomic swap exchanges use centralized order books and order matching systems, but they are still considerably more decentralized than their centralized non-custodial counterparts (i.e. Changelly). They also present themselves as interesting solutions as they will likely offer more liquidity than bare bone atomic swaps, and could even be able to be integrated into Particl Desktop either as DEXes or checkout options. Some good examples of such middle-ground services could be found in <a href=\"http://altcoin.io/\"><strong>Altcoin.io</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://atomicwallet.io/\"><strong>AtomicWallet</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"-16-58-has-the-njit-department-of-technology-reviewed-a-potential-weakness-with-ringct-when-it-comes-to-low-number-of-transactions\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=16m58s\">16:58</a>) Has the NJIT Department of Technology Reviewed a Potential Weakness with RingCT When it Comes to Low Number of Transactions?</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--7/1-W4AGhjMKDTJ9a2Tf48xerg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>For some context, this question addresses the potential weakness of privacy protocols when confronted with a low amount of transactions. As a general rule of thumb, the more private transactions there are on a given chain, the more private these transactions are estimated to be. We’ve known this potential issue for some time, in fact, this is a problem every single privacy coins have to deal with. This is one of the reasons the marketplace and <strong>RingCT</strong> are on parallel tracks for mainnet release. Indeed, we strongly believe the number of marketplace transactions (since they will all default to <strong>RingCT</strong>) coupled with non-marketplace <strong>RingCT</strong> cryptocurrency transactions will at least maintain a solid anonymity set floor that will get higher as other <strong>Particl</strong> <strong>Dapps</strong> then start to make their appearance in the future. Because a lot of <strong>RingCT</strong>-based privacy coins are just that, coins, they rely on one single source of transactions (currency transactions) to keep their anonymity set high whereas, with Particl, real-world use-case is very likely to help a lot with the quality of the privacy on the platform.</p><p>That being said, our <strong>RingCT</strong> implementation has been academically reviewed by the NJIT Department of Technology and they’ve focused on various aspects of the protocol, including how to optimize privacy within various anonymity sets and ways to improve (or maintain) the overall privacy of the protocol when faced with many potential scenarios.</p><p>We’d also like to reemphasize that <strong>privacy, security, and decentralization are three of our core values</strong>. We absolutely agree that the marketplace should be as private and secure as it could potentially be once it launches on mainnet, and we are actively researching and working on implementations to make sure these three core values are respected at any time and with all of Particl’s core features.</p><h3 id=\"-22-54-is-the-team-looking-into-other-privacy-protocols-and-if-so-what-would-be-the-implementation-estimate\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=22m54s\">22:54</a>) Is the team looking into other privacy protocols, and if so, what would be the implementation estimate?</h3><p>We are not looking into other privacy schemes, but <strong>Tecnovert is currently working on some RingCT improvements</strong> he’s been wanting to implement for some time now. Although no major issue or vulnerability has been detected in both <strong>WSA’s</strong> <strong>security</strong> <strong>audit</strong> and <strong>NJIT’s</strong> <strong>academic</strong> <strong>review</strong>, some minor issues might have convinced him that it would be worth it to work on the improvements before we proceed with our <strong>RingCT</strong> + governance hardfork. Although these changes do not constitute an outright change of privacy protocol, they are small improvements our developers see the need to fix after over 1 year of testing and outside review. It might be interesting to note that, as Dasource/Shazzy (Particl Research &amp; Development) mentioned, these changes being made to the <strong>RingCT</strong> scheme could mean that the privacy protocol may not be able to be defined as purely a ring signature + confidential transaction setup (<strong>RingCT</strong>) but something a bit different. These changes will make the <strong>RingCT</strong> protocol a <strong>more private</strong> solution and one that is potentially <strong>cheaper to use</strong>.</p><p>The very first commits related to these <strong>RingCT</strong> improvements have started appearing on Github this week. More details will be communicated at a later time. In the meantime, you can have a look at the work being accomplished by Tecnovert by following the Particl Core repository’s commit page.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master\"><strong>Particl-Core — Commits</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master\"><em>Particl Core integration/staging tree.

That being said, we are absolutely confident in the solutions and improvements that Tecnovert has identified and started working on, and we also believe that marketplace activity will greatly help with the transaction pool.</p><p>It’s also very important to note that privacy doesn’t stop at currency transactions. Everything built on Particl is being built with privacy in mind and in a constant state of evolution. For example, we are currently making a <strong>major code refactoring of the MAD escrow system</strong> which will make it <strong>more private</strong> and again, potentially <strong>cheaper to use</strong>. Another example of how privacy and security are being taken care of at every level of the platform is with the fiat price pegging mechanism. It would be easy to simply integrate some API from CoinMarketCap that updates prices every 5 seconds or so, but that would also leak some data such as user location based on currency bias that a passive observer could use to start profiling users.</p><p>Every single aspect of Particl Marketplace is built with privacy and security at its very core, and all these functions add up in symbiosis and contribute to the privacy factor of the platform. We are in a constant state of research when it comes to security and privacy solutions. As we often say, it’s in our DNA, and it is what we are all about!</p><h3 id=\"-28-33-when-is-marketing-going-to-kick-up\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=28m33s\">28:33</a>) When is marketing going to kick up?</h3><p>Internally, the preparations for the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace <strong>has already started</strong>. This week, our marketing/comm team has moved to <strong>Jira</strong>, just like our developer team has done earlier this summer. In fact, adopting agile methodologies has made a tremendous difference and helped our dev team a lot in attaining better productivity as well as intra-team communication efficiency, and we are looking forward to applying this same approach to our marketing/comm team. We’ve also been reshuffling some of our resources, are reviewing our budget, have started contacting some of the people we identify as key people for the launch, and have started drafting various documents and strategies to ensure that Particl Marketplace’s launch is done properly.</p><h3 id=\"-35-11-did-qiang-tang-work-on-private-listings-for-particl-marketplace\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=35m11s\">35:11</a>) Did Qiang Tang work on private listings for Particl Marketplace?</h3><p>No, this is not part of what they reviewed.</p><h3 id=\"-35-45-how-much-time-would-it-take-the-team-to-release-private-listings-on-testnet\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=35m45s\">35:45</a>) How much time would it take the team to release private listings on testnet?</h3><p>Our team’s goal is to have Particl Marketplace Beta ready by the end of the year, so working back from that point private listings should be released on testnet within that timeframe. Private listings are probably not as critical of a feature as <strong>RingCT</strong> and governance, and while we do want this feature to be part of the mainnet release, it might also make its appearance on testnet after Beta. The marketplace has, however, been designed with this very feature in mind, and the word from our developers is that it should be relatively easy and quick to implement.</p><p>As with everything, Particl is a project with a lot of moving targets and the order and timeframe at which features are released can vary greatly depending on a multitude of factors.</p><h3 id=\"-37-01-if-the-governance-mechanism-and-ringct-work-fine-would-the-marketplace-potentially-be-pushed-to-mainnet-even-though-all-the-items-identified-as-beta-items-aren-t-ready-yet\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=37m1s\">37:01</a>) If the governance mechanism and RingCT work fine, would the marketplace potentially be pushed to mainnet even though all the items identified as Beta items aren’t ready yet?</h3><p>As mentioned above, the two main items required for Beta are the <strong>governance system</strong> and <strong>RingCT</strong>. Other features will also most likely be part of the mainnet release, although it could be debated whether to include them or not at first if they are not ready and we are “in an urge” to release the marketplace.</p><h3 id=\"-38-14-could-we-at-least-have-one-guest-per-ama-faq-livestream-to-show-the-project-from-another-perspective\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=38m14s\">38:14</a>) Could we at least have one guest per AMA/FAQ Livestream to show the project from another perspective?</h3><p>Yes, we fully agree. Our developers are very busy with the coding part of the marketplace but it would be great to get more guests from time to time. Some of our best livestreams happened with some of our developers on. It might be possible that for the next livestream we’ll be joined by our <strong>Lead Graphic Designer CRZ</strong>.</p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &amp; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-1-2-3-released\">Particl Desktop 1.2.3 Released</h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673\"><strong>Particl Desktop 1.2.3 Release</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673\"><em>Recently, most of the Particl Desktop application development has been focused on the marketplace, but its wallet…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673\">particl.news</a></p><p>We released on the 12th of September <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.2.3\">Particl Desktop 1.2.3</a>, a major update on the <strong>mainnet</strong> wallet capabilities of Particl Desktop.

There are some interesting updates, such as the <strong>RingCT implementation (enhancements)</strong> and the modification currently being done to the governance system. In fact, the development team is <strong>switching the measurement of the voting period duration on community proposals from a block height base to a time base</strong>. It is also possible to see that some of the items related to the Settings tab have been moved over to the Review section.</p><p>You may have noticed that on pretty much every Status Reports, there are mentions of <strong>code refactoring</strong>. Indeed, Particl is leading-edge protocol in terms of technology, and a lot of what’s being accomplished has never been done in the past. While this is most definitely exciting, it is also challenging for our developers as there is very little to compare to or use as a comparative figure. This means that, while they are simultaneously building various pieces of the Particl puzzle, they might, along the way, figure out better, more efficient ways to code some stuff. This is what’s called a <strong>code refactoring</strong>.</p><blockquote>The process of restructuring existing computer code — changing the factoring — without changing its external behavior. Refactoring improves nonfunctional attributes of the software. — <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring\">Wikipedia</a></blockquote><p>You can expect a lot of code refactoring this year as we keep on improving the Particl platform and its infrastructure in order to make as <strong>smooth</strong>, <strong>efficient</strong>, <strong>pleasant to use</strong>, but most importantly, <strong>secure</strong> and <strong>private</strong> as possible.</p><h3 id=\"cold-staking-sneak-peek\">Cold Staking Sneak Peek</h3><blockquote></blockquote><p>We published last Friday a sneak peek of Tecnovert’s <strong>cold staking pool</strong>. While it is still unclear how exactly this pool will be released, once it does it will allow users to delegate their staking powers to a cold staking pool that will have the ability to manage payouts. This means a user with only a few PART coins could receive payouts in smaller increments than a~1.25 PART; Particl’s current staking reward amount. This is a great achievement for our project as that heavily reduces the barrier of entry to staking, meaning no one gets left behind based on monetary values.</p><p>We will have more information about the cold staking pool as we near its launch.</p><h3 id=\"community-proposals-make-their-way-onto-particl-s-testnet\">Community Proposals Make Their Way onto Particl’s Testnet</h3><p>As announced in our last <a href=\"https://particl.news/community-update-6-3ead71971cfe\">Community Update #6</a>, the governance mechanism for the <strong>Community Proposals</strong> as seen its first iteration make its way onto testnet.

We still have big plans for <strong>Changelly</strong>, and we definitely think they will help a lot make our currency-agnostic vision become reality by providing a wide array of coins as well as the liquidity to support each of them. They also provide a great developer API toolkit which will allow us to experiment with a lot of what they offer and make the integration that much easier.</p><p>As per our currency-agnostic approach, we are designing Particl Desktop (our main wallet) in such a way that it could easily integrate <strong>Changelly</strong>, but also any other similar service. That means that while we are going to integrate Changelly directly within Particl Desktop, we may end up integrating several other services, some that may provide different coins, features, and services. We believe that Particl’s agnostic approach will help get the marketplace much more adoption as well as empower other cryptocurrency communities by providing them more utility and a convenient way to spend their coins.</p><h3 id=\"-4-07-is-it-currently-being-worked-on\">(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfKSgp5WtJ4&#x26;feature=youtu.be&#x26;t=4m8s\">4:07</a>) Is it currently being worked on?</h3><p>The team is currently focused on the development of the Beta version of Particl Marketplace and <strong>the integration is not being actively worked on right now</strong> as it hasn’t been identified as a “Beta item”. We’ve also approached Changelly to discuss including them in one of our testnet iteration of Particl Marketplace, but they do not operate a testnet or test version of their product, so that makes integrating Changelly impossible within any of our testnet version.</p><p>Don’t forget that Particl Desktop is still designed in such a way that would make this integration easy to set up and, as we go down the list of priorities, this will be worked on after the release of Particl Marketplace Beta. Being currency-agnostic is and will stay one of our core vision.</p><p>We would like to mention that it is always possible to see what’s currently being worked on right and what’s scheduled to be worked on after that by checking out our <a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\"><strong>Status Report</strong></a> page on <a href=\"http://particl.io\"><strong>particl.io</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"-10-14-can-the-team-make-atomic-swaps-more-user-friendly\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=10m14s\">10:14</a>) Can the team make atomic swaps more user-friendly?</h3><p>As it currently stands today, <strong>atomic swaps</strong> (the trustless coin exchanging protocol) are very rough around the edges and most definitely a bleeding-edge way to trade cryptocurrencies mostly reserved for advanced users. There are no easy-to-understand guides out there yet, and the number of people willing to trade their coin through atomic swaps is definitely limited for the moment.</p><p>At Particl more precisely, <strong>we’ve had atomic swaps ready on mainnet ever since October 2017</strong>, but never really have integrated it into any of our wallets so far. As with everything we do, user-friendliness and making available accessible solutions is one of our top priority, so rest assured that our integration of <strong>atomic swaps</strong> will be built in such a way that it can be easily used by anyone without advanced technical knowledge. It might not be perfect on its first iteration but just like Particl Desktop, for example, it will keep on getting improved as time goes on and as we receive feedback from users. Considering how advanced and complicated executing <strong>atomic swaps</strong> currently is though, such an easy-to-use integration could take some time until it is officially released on mainnet. As for the integration itself, we have been bouncing ideas between two solutions:</p><p><strong>Decentralized Exchange Dapp for Particl</strong></p><p>It’s been discussed for some time that we might be interested in building a <strong>decentralized exchange based on atomic swaps</strong> somewhere in the future. This is obviously not an item on our current roadmap, nor is this even guaranteed to ever happen, but it is one of the solutions we discussed as being interesting for the platform.</p><p><strong>Checkout Option</strong></p><p>Having the ability to have the users choose what payment method they would like to use <strong>as part of the checkout process</strong> might be a more intuitive way to go about it. This is, after all, how most eCommerce platforms and plugins do it. This would not require users to store any coin on Particl Desktop and would be a really user-friendly way to use atomic swaps that resembles how people already do online payments.</p><p><strong>Decentralized Exchange Integrations</strong></p><p>There are, however, middle-ground solutions that could be deployed in the meantime. In fact, some projects are currently working on Changelly/Shapeshift-like services built using atomic swaps and other decentralized means of exchange. These are, of course, not 100% trustless solutions since most of these atomic swap exchanges use centralized order books and order matching systems, but they are still considerably more decentralized than their centralized non-custodial counterparts (i.e. Changelly). They also present themselves as interesting solutions as they will likely offer more liquidity than bare bone atomic swaps, and could even be able to be integrated into Particl Desktop either as DEXes or checkout options. Some good examples of such middle-ground services could be found in <a href=\"http://altcoin.io/\"><strong>Altcoin.io</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://atomicwallet.io/\"><strong>AtomicWallet</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"-16-58-has-the-njit-department-of-technology-reviewed-a-potential-weakness-with-ringct-when-it-comes-to-low-number-of-transactions\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=16m58s\">16:58</a>) Has the NJIT Department of Technology Reviewed a Potential Weakness with RingCT When it Comes to Low Number of Transactions?</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--7/1-W4AGhjMKDTJ9a2Tf48xerg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>For some context, this question addresses the potential weakness of privacy protocols when confronted with a low amount of transactions. As a general rule of thumb, the more private transactions there are on a given chain, the more private these transactions are estimated to be. We’ve known this potential issue for some time, in fact, this is a problem every single privacy coins have to deal with. This is one of the reasons the marketplace and <strong>RingCT</strong> are on parallel tracks for mainnet release. Indeed, we strongly believe the number of marketplace transactions (since they will all default to <strong>RingCT</strong>) coupled with non-marketplace <strong>RingCT</strong> cryptocurrency transactions will at least maintain a solid anonymity set floor that will get higher as other <strong>Particl</strong> <strong>Dapps</strong> then start to make their appearance in the future. Because a lot of <strong>RingCT</strong>-based privacy coins are just that, coins, they rely on one single source of transactions (currency transactions) to keep their anonymity set high whereas, with Particl, real-world use-case is very likely to help a lot with the quality of the privacy on the platform.</p><p>That being said, our <strong>RingCT</strong> implementation has been academically reviewed by the NJIT Department of Technology and they’ve focused on various aspects of the protocol, including how to optimize privacy within various anonymity sets and ways to improve (or maintain) the overall privacy of the protocol when faced with many potential scenarios.</p><p>We’d also like to reemphasize that <strong>privacy, security, and decentralization are three of our core values</strong>. We absolutely agree that the marketplace should be as private and secure as it could potentially be once it launches on mainnet, and we are actively researching and working on implementations to make sure these three core values are respected at any time and with all of Particl’s core features.</p><h3 id=\"-22-54-is-the-team-looking-into-other-privacy-protocols-and-if-so-what-would-be-the-implementation-estimate\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=22m54s\">22:54</a>) Is the team looking into other privacy protocols, and if so, what would be the implementation estimate?</h3><p>We are not looking into other privacy schemes, but <strong>Tecnovert is currently working on some RingCT improvements</strong> he’s been wanting to implement for some time now. Although no major issue or vulnerability has been detected in both <strong>WSA’s</strong> <strong>security</strong> <strong>audit</strong> and <strong>NJIT’s</strong> <strong>academic</strong> <strong>review</strong>, some minor issues might have convinced him that it would be worth it to work on the improvements before we proceed with our <strong>RingCT</strong> + governance hardfork. Although these changes do not constitute an outright change of privacy protocol, they are small improvements our developers see the need to fix after over 1 year of testing and outside review. It might be interesting to note that, as Dasource/Shazzy (Particl Research &#x26; Development) mentioned, these changes being made to the <strong>RingCT</strong> scheme could mean that the privacy protocol may not be able to be defined as purely a ring signature + confidential transaction setup (<strong>RingCT</strong>) but something a bit different. These changes will make the <strong>RingCT</strong> protocol a <strong>more private</strong> solution and one that is potentially <strong>cheaper to use</strong>.</p><p>The very first commits related to these <strong>RingCT</strong> improvements have started appearing on Github this week. More details will be communicated at a later time. In the meantime, you can have a look at the work being accomplished by Tecnovert by following the Particl Core repository’s commit page.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master\"><strong>Particl-Core — Commits</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master\"><em>Particl Core integration/staging tree.

That being said, we are absolutely confident in the solutions and improvements that Tecnovert has identified and started working on, and we also believe that marketplace activity will greatly help with the transaction pool.</p><p>It’s also very important to note that privacy doesn’t stop at currency transactions. Everything built on Particl is being built with privacy in mind and in a constant state of evolution. For example, we are currently making a <strong>major code refactoring of the MAD escrow system</strong> which will make it <strong>more private</strong> and again, potentially <strong>cheaper to use</strong>. Another example of how privacy and security are being taken care of at every level of the platform is with the fiat price pegging mechanism. It would be easy to simply integrate some API from CoinMarketCap that updates prices every 5 seconds or so, but that would also leak some data such as user location based on currency bias that a passive observer could use to start profiling users.</p><p>Every single aspect of Particl Marketplace is built with privacy and security at its very core, and all these functions add up in symbiosis and contribute to the privacy factor of the platform. We are in a constant state of research when it comes to security and privacy solutions. As we often say, it’s in our DNA, and it is what we are all about!</p><h3 id=\"-28-33-when-is-marketing-going-to-kick-up\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=28m33s\">28:33</a>) When is marketing going to kick up?</h3><p>Internally, the preparations for the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace <strong>has already started</strong>. This week, our marketing/comm team has moved to <strong>Jira</strong>, just like our developer team has done earlier this summer. In fact, adopting agile methodologies has made a tremendous difference and helped our dev team a lot in attaining better productivity as well as intra-team communication efficiency, and we are looking forward to applying this same approach to our marketing/comm team. We’ve also been reshuffling some of our resources, are reviewing our budget, have started contacting some of the people we identify as key people for the launch, and have started drafting various documents and strategies to ensure that Particl Marketplace’s launch is done properly.</p><h3 id=\"-35-11-did-qiang-tang-work-on-private-listings-for-particl-marketplace\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=35m11s\">35:11</a>) Did Qiang Tang work on private listings for Particl Marketplace?</h3><p>No, this is not part of what they reviewed.</p><h3 id=\"-35-45-how-much-time-would-it-take-the-team-to-release-private-listings-on-testnet\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=35m45s\">35:45</a>) How much time would it take the team to release private listings on testnet?</h3><p>Our team’s goal is to have Particl Marketplace Beta ready by the end of the year, so working back from that point private listings should be released on testnet within that timeframe. Private listings are probably not as critical of a feature as <strong>RingCT</strong> and governance, and while we do want this feature to be part of the mainnet release, it might also make its appearance on testnet after Beta. The marketplace has, however, been designed with this very feature in mind, and the word from our developers is that it should be relatively easy and quick to implement.</p><p>As with everything, Particl is a project with a lot of moving targets and the order and timeframe at which features are released can vary greatly depending on a multitude of factors.</p><h3 id=\"-37-01-if-the-governance-mechanism-and-ringct-work-fine-would-the-marketplace-potentially-be-pushed-to-mainnet-even-though-all-the-items-identified-as-beta-items-aren-t-ready-yet\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=37m1s\">37:01</a>) If the governance mechanism and RingCT work fine, would the marketplace potentially be pushed to mainnet even though all the items identified as Beta items aren’t ready yet?</h3><p>As mentioned above, the two main items required for Beta are the <strong>governance system</strong> and <strong>RingCT</strong>. Other features will also most likely be part of the mainnet release, although it could be debated whether to include them or not at first if they are not ready and we are “in an urge” to release the marketplace.</p><h3 id=\"-38-14-could-we-at-least-have-one-guest-per-ama-faq-livestream-to-show-the-project-from-another-perspective\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=38m14s\">38:14</a>) Could we at least have one guest per AMA/FAQ Livestream to show the project from another perspective?</h3><p>Yes, we fully agree. Our developers are very busy with the coding part of the marketplace but it would be great to get more guests from time to time. Some of our best livestreams happened with some of our developers on. It might be possible that for the next livestream we’ll be joined by our <strong>Lead Graphic Designer CRZ</strong>.</p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &#x26; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-1-2-3-released\">Particl Desktop 1.2.3 Released</h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673\"><strong>Particl Desktop 1.2.3 Release</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673\"><em>Recently, most of the Particl Desktop application development has been focused on the marketplace, but its wallet…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673\">particl.news</a></p><p>We released on the 12th of September <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.2.3\">Particl Desktop 1.2.3</a>, a major update on the <strong>mainnet</strong> wallet capabilities of Particl Desktop.

There are some interesting updates, such as the <strong>RingCT implementation (enhancements)</strong> and the modification currently being done to the governance system. In fact, the development team is <strong>switching the measurement of the voting period duration on community proposals from a block height base to a time base</strong>. It is also possible to see that some of the items related to the Settings tab have been moved over to the Review section.</p><p>You may have noticed that on pretty much every Status Reports, there are mentions of <strong>code refactoring</strong>. Indeed, Particl is leading-edge protocol in terms of technology, and a lot of what’s being accomplished has never been done in the past. While this is most definitely exciting, it is also challenging for our developers as there is very little to compare to or use as a comparative figure. This means that, while they are simultaneously building various pieces of the Particl puzzle, they might, along the way, figure out better, more efficient ways to code some stuff. This is what’s called a <strong>code refactoring</strong>.</p><blockquote>The process of restructuring existing computer code — changing the factoring — without changing its external behavior. Refactoring improves nonfunctional attributes of the software. — <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring\">Wikipedia</a></blockquote><p>You can expect a lot of code refactoring this year as we keep on improving the Particl platform and its infrastructure in order to make as <strong>smooth</strong>, <strong>efficient</strong>, <strong>pleasant to use</strong>, but most importantly, <strong>secure</strong> and <strong>private</strong> as possible.</p><h3 id=\"cold-staking-sneak-peek\">Cold Staking Sneak Peek</h3><blockquote></blockquote><p>We published last Friday a sneak peek of Tecnovert’s <strong>cold staking pool</strong>. While it is still unclear how exactly this pool will be released, once it does it will allow users to delegate their staking powers to a cold staking pool that will have the ability to manage payouts. This means a user with only a few PART coins could receive payouts in smaller increments than a~1.25 PART; Particl’s current staking reward amount. This is a great achievement for our project as that heavily reduces the barrier of entry to staking, meaning no one gets left behind based on monetary values.</p><p>We will have more information about the cold staking pool as we near its launch.</p><h3 id=\"community-proposals-make-their-way-onto-particl-s-testnet\">Community Proposals Make Their Way onto Particl’s Testnet</h3><p>As announced in our last <a href=\"https://particl.news/community-update-6-3ead71971cfe\">Community Update #6</a>, the governance mechanism for the <strong>Community Proposals</strong> as seen its first iteration make its way onto testnet.

Built With Privacy in Mind from the Ground Up!\nUnlike all of its competition, Particl is built from the ground up to be\nentirely private/anonymous, following the true crypto roots. To accomplish this\ndifficult prowess, it uses several methods to keep its users within an optimal\nprivacy environment, such as the RingCT and CT privacy protocols, metadata\nstripping, IP address anonymization through Tor (and many more protocols in the\nfuture, including Dandelion++ [https://particl.community/t/what-is-dandelion/78]\n), private escrow system with no intermediate, encrypted and private messaging\n(using SMSG\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/smsg.html] and\neventually more scalable and leading-edge DSNs\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/overview.html] \nsuch as Loopix\n[https://particl.community/t/the-loopix-anonymity-system-a-new-potential-dsn-for-particl/181]\n, IPFS [https://ipfs.io/], and etc), and much more. With all the data leaks and\nhacks, privacy is becoming more and more mainstream\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f] \n(link to case for privacy)\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f].\n\nFurthermore, we all see that the government and big companies have developed\nvery effective blockchain tracking software that makes tracking public\ncryptocurrency transactions quite trivial\n[https://bitcoinist.com/yes-your-bitcoin-transactions-can-be-tracked-and-here-are-the-companies-that-are-doing-it/]\n. Indeed, it may be just as bad in terms of privacy to use a public blockchain\nthan say, a bank or payment processor. This is why having a product built with\nprivacy in mind right from the start (vs patching privacy into a non-private\nblockchain) is extremely important. Every day, the “if you have nothing to hide,\nyou don’t really need privacy” kind of thinking is becoming obsolete as people\nrealize just how much privacy is important even for “good behaving” people.\nPlus, there is definitely some kind of people that do require a more private\nenvironment, which they’ll want to use a solution that’s been designed with this\nas a prime aspect.\n\nBut why does that even matter?\nAs broken down in an earlier article of mine\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f],\nprivacy is becoming a hot subject in the mainstream world. Gone are the days\nwhere privacy was associated to people who had “things to hide”.\n\n> In light of the recent and now too regular cyber attacks on tech giants like \nEquifax\n[https://www.business2community.com/cybersecurity/a-year-after-the-equifax-data-breach-what-if-nothing-changes-02062051]\n, Facebook\n[http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/facebook-data-sharing-privacy-mobile-companies-mark-zuckerberg-cambridge-analytica-5208703/]\n, Deloitte [http://fortune.com/2017/09/25/deloitte-hack/], Yahoo\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ireland-dataprotection-yahoo/yahoos-eu-regulator-orders-privacy-changes-over-data-breach-idUSKCN1J32JX]\n, FedEx\n[https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3026819/thousands-of-fedex-customers-private-information-exposed-in-legacy-server-data-breach]\n, Uber [http://fortune.com/2018/04/12/uber-data-breach-security/], Under Armour\n[https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/another-fitness-app-exposes-users-data-a-11055] \nor even Pizza Hut\n[http://www.information-age.com/pizza-hut-suffers-data-breach-123469137/], the\npoor communication and, even in some cases, cover-up of the unfortunate facts,\nthe public confidence towards the tech industry has been severely eroded within\nthe last couple of years.\nThe Case for Privacy in the Tech Industry\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f]\nNowadays, the tech industry has its users seeking for solutions they can trust\nwith their personal data. In light of…particl.news\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f]\n\nBreaches of personal data are becoming far too common, and a good solution to\nfight this issue is to stop sharing your data with big companies that do not\nrespect your private life. However, opting for blockchains instead can be just\nas bad, if not worse, than relying on trusting a big corporation. Why you ask?\nBecause blockchains are usually open for all to see by default. Indeed,\ntransactions on public blockchains are getting easier to track by the day, and\nfor vendors and buyers alike, this isn’t good. Buyers obviously don’t want\neveryone to know what they’re buying and just how many coins they hold,\ninformation that could be obtained simply by analyzing a decentralized\nmarketplace based on a public blockchain. Vendors, on the other hand, do not\nwant anyone to analyze their sales data, statistics, and revenues.\n\nParticl is built as a private-by-default marketplace, meaning that users do not\nneed to go through several steps to protect their personal data. Everything\nhappens automatically, under the hood, and as smoothly as you would expect from\na public blockchain.\n\nBuilt as a 100% Decentralized & Trustless Solution\nAnother advantage is that the Particl Marketplace is designed as a 100%\ndecentralized and trustless solution, which most of its competitors aren’t. Just\nas an example, Syscoin’s Blockmarket interface is closed-source and moderated by\nSyscoin staff. Escrows on Syscoin are arbitrated, meaning there needs to be\nsomeone acting as escrow agent in case a deal turns sour. This can quickly lead\nto bias, collusion, or other similar types of issue born from the simple fact\nthat a third-party basically has full power over the settlement of a dispute.\nTalking to various vendors, this quickly becomes an issue for vendors on eBay,\nfor example, because eBay/Paypal will most of the time side with the buyer, even\nwhen it shouldn’t.\n\nOn Particl Marketplace, there is literally no counter-party at play. The escrow\nis based on smart-contract functionalities and uses the MAD game-theory to keep\nboth parties honest, no moderator required to settle disputes. The marketplace\nitself will be entirely governed by the community, making sure no person or\ngroup of person is held liable for the content published on it or collude with\neither vendors or buyers. This is much closer, in my personal opinion, to the\noriginal, crypto-anarchist vision and reason of why Bitcoin was created in the\nfirst place.\n\nFun fact, did you know that Satoshi Nakamoto had started working on a 100%\ntrustless and decentralized marketplace and that there was even some code about\nit in some Bitcoin’s repository?\n\nMuch Better & Intuitive User Interface\nParticl has a beautiful UI/UX that is built with accessibility and ease-of-use\nin mind. This top of the line wallet looks modern, slick, and is very easy to\nunderstand as well as being very smooth and responsive. The same can’t be said\nof most wallets in the crypto sphere, most of them being far too geeky or\nbarebone to be used by mainstream, non-crypto users.\n\nAdditionally, Particl plans on developing a web & mobile interface at some point\nin the future, which they already have a good idea of how they would go about\nit. In order to break into the mainstream, the marketplace will need to be as\neasy to use as any other online eCommerce platform, therefore a web and mobile\ninterface are absolutely required. While this isn’t currently part of the\nroadmap, it certainly is a milestone the team plans on tackling after the\nmainnet release of Particl Marketplace.\n\nParticl Marketplace AlphaDownload Particl Marketplace Alpha here: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.0-market-alpha\n\nMore recent builds are available from time to time in our #testing channel: \nhttps://discord.gg/Xf8Yyc\n\nParticl is Much More Than a Decentralized Marketplace\nIn the end, Particl is actually much more than just a marketplace, it is a\nfull-blown privacy-focused dApp platform. Indeed, the team has put in its\nroadmap the release of a developer SDK toolkit which will allow any developer\nout there to easily build their own application on Particl. Whether it be a\nsocial media/Twitter-like application, a decentralized gambling Dapp, or even\nthe addition of a penny auction section to Particl Marketplace, the SDK will\ntruly allow the network to grow into much more than just a decentralized\nmarketplace.\n\nThe goal here is not to directly compete with other smart-contract platforms\nlike Ethereum, it’s more about being a decentralized platform where dApps can\nall be interacted with directly from the wallet in order to create something\nakin to perhaps an operating system. Imagine the wallet (Particl Desktop) as an\nAndroid OS and each Particl dApps as Android applications. The Particl Desktop\nwallet is kind of like the wrapper which contains the dApps that make the\nParticl decentralized economy, and these applications are designed to fit right\ninto it in a very intuitive and user-friendly fashion (in contrast to other Dapp\nplatforms which are generally pretty barebone).\n\nOne of Particl’s goal is to take crypto a step further by not only\ndecentralizing currency but also to decentralize the entire infrastructure\nsurrounding said currency (and that, obviously, includes the eCommerce\ninfrastructure on which the coin can be spent).\n\nTop-Tier Development Team\nThe Particl development team is definitely a top-tier team. They are indeed\nranked 6th in one of the most thorough code quality review (\nhttps://medium.com/darpalrating/darpalrating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-march-2018-3c6b839abdaa\n[https://medium.com/dprating/dprating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-june-2018-who-is-still-coding-in-the-bear-283c89735cbe]\n) that did review up to 200 coins (in comparison, Syscoin is currently ranked\n36th, BitBay is 192nd, Safex is not even active enough to be ranked). The code\nquality review takes a lot of things into account, and disregards community and\nmarketing, solely focusing on the code itself. This is something the Particl\nteam is extremely proud of! Indeed, the Particl team was the first reach\naccomplish many achievements such as true cold staking, hardware cold staking\n(Ledger + cold staking), first blockchain to be natively implemented with\nSegwit, first to implement the RingCT and CT protocols on top of the Bitcoin\ncodebase, and always the first to update it’s codebase (currently on 0.16.0.2\nwith 0.17 ready on testnet) to the latest Bitcoin Core version (after Bitcoin\nitself, of course). They have had a lot of other accomplishments as well, though\nthey were not the first to execute them. It is, overall, a very talented team\nthat is not afraid to push the limit while never sacrificing privacy, security\nand decentralization.\n\nTo see the incredible development work made over time, watch the Github\nvisualization videos included in this blog post: \nhttps://particl.news/particl-development-timeline-video-520d8f9c0513\n\nMany Decentralized Marketplaces Could and Probably Will Co-Exist\nAs we are seeing with privacy coins right now, a lot of them are identical or\nalmost identical, yet each of these coins has their own dedicated community.\nSame thing with eCommerce platforms. We have Amazon, Alibaba, eBay, Etsy, and\netc…all co-existing and making profits within their own community or niche. I\nthink we’ll see the same happen with decentralized marketplaces. Wise vendors\nwon’t limit their business to one platform, as that would end up limiting their\npotential customer base. Instead, I see many decentralized marketplaces all\nco-existing and all sharing a share of the decentralized marketplace industry.\nThis is not a winner take all kind of scenario, as long as a marketplace can\noffer good features, good UI/UX, low or no fees, and of course, products for\nsale AND customers, these platforms stand a chance to survive even though they\nare not alone in this space.\n\nWhat I do find very interesting in Particl compared to other decentralized\nmarketplaces is how its native coin is designed to be scarce and in high demand.\nAs such, even a small volume of marketplace transactions could increase the\nvalue of Particl considerably. That is because:\n\n * Users will generate demand for the coin when making purchases (even if they\n   use another coin)\n * More coins get locked up for a certain period of time in escrow. In reality, \n   up to three times the value of an item can end up locked up in escrow as the\n   buyer needs to pay for the item + make a security deposit while the vendor\n   also has to put a security deposit. Escrow lockups can last from minutes, to\n   hours to days and weeks, depending on the specific context and use-case.\n * A great portion of the coins are locked up in staking (can be transferred out\n   at any time, but while they are staking they are effectively out of\n   circulation) as the passive income gained from the process becomes very\n   interesting when the marketplace gets transactions volume since stakers get\n   100% of the listings fees and other Dapp revenues. Currently, around 36.6% of\n   the entire supply is out of circulation and being staked. Many in the\n   community expects this amount to increase as the marketplace gets traction.\n   Note that there is no minimum amount of PART required for staking, thus\n   anyone can stake and receive rewards. That is even more true with the coming\n   staking pool currently under development that will allow even the smallest of\n   holders to stake their funds and receive smaller but more recurrent rewards.\n * Users are not forced to use PART, they can use their favorite cryptocurrency.\n   Ultimately, non-PART transactions are still settled in PART in the\n   background, generating demand for the coin. Particl indeed aims at attracting\n   other communities to its platform and offer a use-case to any coin. It\n   doesn’t mean its native coin PART cannot be positively impacted from this!\n\nThe four points above are why I believe that, even though many decentralized\nmarketplaces will most probably end up all splitting shares of the same pie,\neven a low volume of transactions on Particl would probably end up naturally\nincrease the price of the coin. No speculation needed when it takes off! This is\none of the biggest reason I got into Particl instead of its competitors (their\ncoins don’t have such good economics, not that I know of at least).\n\nThird-Party Building on the Particl Protocol (Mubiz)\nAnother big thing about Particl too is that Mubiz [https://mubiz.com/], a\ndecentralized marketplace aggregator and web gateway, is actually working on\nimplementing the marketplace. What this means is that Mubiz will render the\nmarketplace available on the web only a few days after its initial release and\nwill offer its customers a whole array of services not readily available on\nParticl Desktop. These services include escrow management on behalf of the user\n(read…no need to deal with the escrow, all in the background and the user\nexperience is no different than eBay), customer support & product returns,\nshipping management (vendors can ship their products to Mubiz), traditional\nmeans of payments (credit/banking cards, eventually Paypal and other fiat\npayment methods), reviews, SEO for listings, and etc.\n\nMubiz currently only operates with OpenBazaar, and Particl will be the second\nmarketplace they’ll be hosting on their platform. They mentioned in an interview\nI conducted with Albin, Mubiz’s Founder, that they had identified issues with\nOpenBazaar (since it’s the first decentralized marketplace ever, it does have\nflaws that can be improved upon) that were not present or that were fixed with\nParticl, hence why they’ve decided to integrate the marketplace into its\nplatform.\n\nInterview with Albin from Mubiz, a Web Interface & Suite of Services Designed\nfor Particl…\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-albin-from-mubiz-a-web-interface-suite-of-services-designed-for-particl-decb9a56ecbe]\nA few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to interview Albin Cauderlier, Founder\nof\nMubiz, a decentralized marketplace…particl.news\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-albin-from-mubiz-a-web-interface-suite-of-services-designed-for-particl-decb9a56ecbe]\n\nMubiz is, in my opinion, going to provide a crucial set of services that will\nmake Particl as easy to use as eBay or Amazon. The only difference? Vendors will\nbe making more money (they will make 100% of the sales proceeds), in turn\nallowing them to lower their prices to score more sales and outplay their\ncompetitors. The end result is more profits for the vendor, more sales, and\ncheaper prices for the customer. Surely this should be an attractive solution\nfor most?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the end, I think the current bear market in the cryptocurrency scene will\nmake people realize the importance of intrinsic value. What if you take\nspeculation out of the equation? Does that make your favorite coin or token\nworthless or not?\n\nThis is what makes me so positive about Particl’s future. Its coin has great\neconomics, the technology is top of the line within the crypto industry, and the\nproject is securely funded for quite some time, with a second funding round that\nshould occur next year. Could Particl end up being in a perfect storm scenario\nat some point in the future?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not intended to be a source of\nadvice or credit analysis with respect to the material presented, and the\ninformation and/or documents contained in this blog post do not constitute\ninvestment advice.

Built With Privacy in Mind from the Ground Up!</h2><p>Unlike all of its competition, Particl is built from the ground up to be entirely private/anonymous, following the true crypto roots. To accomplish this difficult prowess, it uses several methods to keep its users within an optimal privacy environment, such as the RingCT and CT privacy protocols, metadata stripping, IP address anonymization through Tor (and many more protocols in the future, including <a href=\"https://particl.community/t/what-is-dandelion/78\">Dandelion++</a>), private escrow system with no intermediate, encrypted and private messaging (using <a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/smsg.html\">SMSG</a> and eventually more scalable and leading-edge <a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/overview.html\">DSNs</a> such as <a href=\"https://particl.community/t/the-loopix-anonymity-system-a-new-potential-dsn-for-particl/181\">Loopix</a>, <a href=\"https://ipfs.io/\">IPFS</a>, and etc), and much more. <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f\">With all the data leaks and hacks, privacy is becoming more and more mainstream</a> <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f\">(link to case for privacy)</a>.</p><p>Furthermore, we all see that the government and big companies have developed very effective blockchain tracking software<a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/yes-your-bitcoin-transactions-can-be-tracked-and-here-are-the-companies-that-are-doing-it/\"> that makes tracking public cryptocurrency transactions quite trivial</a>.

Escrow lockups can last from minutes, to hours to days and weeks, depending on the specific context and use-case.</li><li>A great portion of the coins are locked up in staking (can be transferred out at any time, but while they are staking they are effectively out of circulation) as the passive income gained from the process becomes very interesting when the marketplace gets transactions volume since stakers get 100% of the listings fees and other Dapp revenues. Currently, around 36.6% of the entire supply is out of circulation and being staked. Many in the community expects this amount to increase as the marketplace gets traction.

That is even more true with the coming staking pool currently under development that will allow even the smallest of holders to stake their funds and receive smaller but more recurrent rewards.</li><li>Users are not forced to use PART, they can use their favorite cryptocurrency.

To accomplish this difficult prowess, it uses several methods to keep its users within an optimal privacy environment, such as the RingCT and CT privacy protocols, metadata stripping, IP address anonymization through Tor (and many more protocols in the future, including <a href=\"https://particl.community/t/what-is-dandelion/78\">Dandelion++</a>), private escrow system with no intermediate, encrypted and private messaging (using <a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/smsg.html\">SMSG</a> and eventually more scalable and leading-edge <a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/overview.html\">DSNs</a> such as <a href=\"https://particl.community/t/the-loopix-anonymity-system-a-new-potential-dsn-for-particl/181\">Loopix</a>, <a href=\"https://ipfs.io/\">IPFS</a>, and etc), and much more. <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f\">With all the data leaks and hacks, privacy is becoming more and more mainstream</a> <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f\">(link to case for privacy)</a>.</p><p>Furthermore, we all see that the government and big companies have developed very effective blockchain tracking software<a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/yes-your-bitcoin-transactions-can-be-tracked-and-here-are-the-companies-that-are-doing-it/\"> that makes tracking public cryptocurrency transactions quite trivial</a>. Indeed, it may be just as bad in terms of privacy to use a public blockchain than say, a bank or payment processor. This is why having a product built with privacy in mind right from the start (vs patching privacy into a non-private blockchain) is extremely important. Every day, the <em>“if</em> <em>you have nothing to hide, you don’t really need privacy”</em> kind of thinking is becoming obsolete as people realize just how much privacy is important even for “good behaving” people.

In light of…</em>particl.news</a></p><p>Breaches of personal data are becoming far too common, and a good solution to fight this issue is to stop sharing your data with big companies that do not respect your private life. However, opting for blockchains instead can be just as bad, if not worse, than relying on trusting a big corporation. Why you ask? Because blockchains are usually open for all to see by default. Indeed, transactions on public blockchains are getting easier to track by the day, and for vendors and buyers alike, this isn’t good. Buyers obviously don’t want everyone to know what they’re buying and just how many coins they hold, information that could be obtained simply by analyzing a decentralized marketplace based on a public blockchain. Vendors, on the other hand, do not want anyone to analyze their sales data, statistics, and revenues.</p><p>Particl is built as a private-by-default marketplace, meaning that users do not need to go through several steps to protect their personal data. Everything happens automatically, under the hood, and as smoothly as you would expect from a public blockchain.</p><h2 id=\"built-as-a-100-decentralized-trustless-solution\">Built as a 100% Decentralized &#x26; Trustless Solution</h2><p>Another advantage is that the Particl Marketplace is designed as a 100% decentralized and trustless solution, which most of its competitors aren’t. Just as an example, Syscoin’s Blockmarket interface is closed-source and moderated by Syscoin staff. Escrows on Syscoin are arbitrated, meaning there needs to be someone acting as escrow agent in case a deal turns sour. This can quickly lead to bias, collusion, or other similar types of issue born from the simple fact that a third-party basically has full power over the settlement of a dispute. Talking to various vendors, this quickly becomes an issue for vendors on eBay, for example, because eBay/Paypal will most of the time side with the buyer, even when it shouldn’t.</p><p>On Particl Marketplace, there is literally no counter-party at play. The escrow is based on smart-contract functionalities and uses the MAD game-theory to keep both parties honest, no moderator required to settle disputes. The marketplace itself will be entirely governed by the community, making sure no person or group of person is held liable for the content published on it or collude with either vendors or buyers. This is much closer, in my personal opinion, to the original, crypto-anarchist vision and reason of why Bitcoin was created in the first place.</p><p>Fun fact, did you know that Satoshi Nakamoto had started working on a 100% trustless and decentralized marketplace and that there was even some code about it in some Bitcoin’s repository?</p><h2 id=\"much-better-intuitive-user-interface\">Much Better &#x26; Intuitive User Interface</h2><p>Particl has a beautiful UI/UX that is built with accessibility and ease-of-use in mind. This top of the line wallet looks modern, slick, and is very easy to understand as well as being very smooth and responsive. The same can’t be said of most wallets in the crypto sphere, most of them being far too geeky or barebone to be used by mainstream, non-crypto users.</p><p>Additionally, Particl plans on developing a web &#x26; mobile interface at some point in the future, which they already have a good idea of how they would go about it. In order to break into the mainstream, the marketplace will need to be as easy to use as any other online eCommerce platform, therefore a web and mobile interface are absolutely required. While this isn’t currently part of the roadmap, it certainly is a milestone the team plans on tackling after the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/What-Makes-Particl-s-Decentralized-Marketplace-Stand-Out-From-its-Competition/0-He_sNQBVTbkHxxHw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl Marketplace Alpha</figcaption></figure><p><em><strong>Download Particl Marketplace Alpha here: </strong></em><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.0-market-alpha\">https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.0-market-alpha</a></p><p><em><strong>More recent builds are available from time to time in our #testing channel:</strong></em> <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Xf8Yyc\">https://discord.gg/Xf8Yyc</a></p><h2 id=\"particl-is-much-more-than-a-decentralized-marketplace\">Particl is Much More Than a Decentralized Marketplace</h2><p>In the end, Particl is actually much more than just a marketplace, it is a full-blown privacy-focused dApp platform. Indeed, the team has put in its roadmap the release of a developer SDK toolkit which will allow any developer out there to easily build their own application on Particl. Whether it be a social media/Twitter-like application, a decentralized gambling Dapp, or even the addition of a penny auction section to Particl Marketplace, the SDK will truly allow the network to grow into much more than just a decentralized marketplace.</p><p>The goal here is not to directly compete with other smart-contract platforms like Ethereum, it’s more about being a decentralized platform where dApps can all be interacted with directly from the wallet in order to create something akin to perhaps an operating system. Imagine the wallet (Particl Desktop) as an Android OS and each Particl dApps as Android applications. The Particl Desktop wallet is kind of like the wrapper which contains the dApps that make the Particl decentralized economy, and these applications are designed to fit right into it in a very intuitive and user-friendly fashion (in contrast to other Dapp platforms which are generally pretty barebone).</p><p>One of Particl’s goal is to take crypto a step further by not only decentralizing currency but also to decentralize the entire infrastructure surrounding said currency (and that, obviously, includes the eCommerce infrastructure on which the coin can be spent).</p><h2 id=\"top-tier-development-team\">Top-Tier Development Team</h2><p>The Particl development team is definitely a top-tier team. They are indeed ranked 6th in one of the most thorough code quality review (<a href=\"https://medium.com/dprating/dprating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-june-2018-who-is-still-coding-in-the-bear-283c89735cbe\"><strong>https://medium.com/darpalrating/darpalrating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-march-2018-3c6b839abdaa</strong></a>) that did review up to 200 coins (in comparison, Syscoin is currently ranked 36th, BitBay is 192nd, Safex is not even active enough to be ranked). The code quality review takes a lot of things into account, and disregards community and marketing, solely focusing on the code itself. This is something the Particl team is extremely proud of! Indeed, the Particl team was the first reach accomplish many achievements such as true cold staking, hardware cold staking (Ledger + cold staking), first blockchain to be natively implemented with Segwit, first to implement the RingCT and CT protocols on top of the Bitcoin codebase, and always the first to update it’s codebase (currently on 0.16.0.2 with 0.17 ready on testnet) to the latest Bitcoin Core version (after Bitcoin itself, of course). They have had a lot of other accomplishments as well, though they were not the first to execute them. It is, overall, a very talented team that is not afraid to push the limit while never sacrificing privacy, security and decentralization.</p><p>To see the incredible development work made over time, watch the Github visualization videos included in this blog post: <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-development-timeline-video-520d8f9c0513\">https://particl.news/particl-development-timeline-video-520d8f9c0513</a></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qfhGfmuLjo8?feature=oembed\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id=\"many-decentralized-marketplaces-could-and-probably-will-co-exist\">Many Decentralized Marketplaces Could and Probably Will Co-Exist</h2><p>As we are seeing with privacy coins right now, a lot of them are identical or almost identical, yet each of these coins has their own dedicated community. Same thing with eCommerce platforms. We have Amazon, Alibaba, eBay, Etsy, and etc…all co-existing and making profits within their own community or niche. I think we’ll see the same happen with decentralized marketplaces. Wise vendors won’t limit their business to one platform, as that would end up limiting their potential customer base. Instead, I see many decentralized marketplaces all co-existing and all sharing a share of the decentralized marketplace industry. This is not a winner take all kind of scenario, as long as a marketplace can offer good features, good UI/UX, low or no fees, and of course, products for sale AND customers, these platforms stand a chance to survive even though they are not alone in this space.</p><p>What I do find very interesting in Particl compared to other decentralized marketplaces is how its native coin is designed to be scarce and in high demand. As such, even a small volume of marketplace transactions could increase the value of Particl considerably. That is because:</p><ul><li>Users will generate demand for the coin when making purchases (even if they use another coin)</li><li>More coins get locked up for a certain period of time in escrow. In reality, <strong>up to three times the value of an item can end up locked up in escrow</strong> as the buyer needs to pay for the item + make a security deposit while the vendor also has to put a security deposit.

The Particl discussion forum is now\nlive and ready to use! This new platform will allow the entire community as well\nas Particl team members to communicate in a new, more organized way than on a\nchat platform. It has already been populated with content such as articles,\ntutorials, posts, news, archived discussions, and more to help kickstart it.\nWithout further ado, let’s dive right in into what this platform is going to\nbring to the Particl community!\n\nFORUM LINK: https://particl.community\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore Details\nDiscourse\nOur new discussion forum [https://particl.community] is based on Discourse\n[http://discourse.com], a slick-looking and high-performance forum platform\ndesigned for the modern-day internet. In fact, Discourse is a very smooth\nplatform which will make the Particl forum experience as smooth as silk as well\nas enable a wide variety of engaging features that will surely come in handy in\nvarious situations. Here are some of the highlights from our own Discourse\nsetup:\n\nStructured Discussions\nThis new forum will help better structure all the discussions going around the\ncommunity. As it stood up until now, the great majority of discussions within\nthe community happened over one of our instant messaging platforms such as\nTelegram or Discord. While this does provide a dynamic way of discussing with\nyour peers in real-time, it fails to make these discussions accessible.\n\nParticl Forum’s HomepageIn fact, there is only a small number of Telegram and\nDiscord channels, most of which are being underused because of the separation\nthey create with the rest of the community which mostly hangs on #general.\nMoreover, discussions quickly get buried under days and weeks of chatter and, at\nsome point, disappear whenever they get too old. This is obviously not an ideal\nset up, especially when it comes to help & support; different users will often\nbe asking the same questions because they cannot be expected to scroll weeks of\nchatter to see if their question has already been answered.\n\nLet’s also not forget that our community is still relatively small compared to\nits full potential when the marketplace will be on mainnet. In fact, some of the\nbigger cryptocurrency communities hosted on Telegram are quite chaotic due to\nthe very nature of instant messaging platforms, so it only makes sense to\nprepare our infrastructure for when we get a good influx of new users.\nFurthermore, as the “forum format” is very popular on the internet and used by\nmillions of people every day, and as we may very well get users that are not\ncryptocurrency users or simply not used to hang in instant messaging platforms,\nhaving a more intuitive and easy-to-navigate platform will surely be something\nthat will make life easier for a lot of people.\n\nCentral Point of Information\nParticl is all about decentralization, but that doesn’t mean the information\nsurrounding the project has to be all over the place. While the Particl Wiki\nalready does more or less of a good job to keep the information about Particl\norganized, we believe the forum will also help a lot. For example, any support\nrequired by a user and later marked as solved will be easy to dig back out and\nlink back to any other user having similar issues.\n\nAny article, video, news, and similar posts will be very easy to find for users,\nand this “everything-under-the-same-hood” approach will definitely help\nnewcomers quickly find the information they are looking for. This is but one\nmore step towards making Particl information more accessible to as many people\nas possible!\n\nHelp & Support\nAmong the many categories that are initially included with the Particl forum is\na Help & Support category. We strongly believe this category to be an absolute\nrequirement for the improvement of user support as well as to make it much\neasier for anyone to find the information they need without having to scroll\nweeks of unrelated discussions on Telegram or Discord. As such, we have ported\nour Particl Wiki [http://particl.wiki]’s FAQ into a pinned thread\n[https://particl.community/t/frequently-asked-questions-faq/43/2] so that users\ncould easily answer the most frequently asked questions by themselves or ask\ntheir questions, if they are not already included, as a reply to the FAQ thread\nso that it could be added to it upon resolving.\n\nMoreover, the forum format is used around the world and is a very popular and\ninstinctive platform to grow communities on. We believe that, as we release the\nmainnet version of Particl Marketplace and attract vendors and buyers, it will\nbecome a very valuable platform to help and support these users which may\nactually not be used to, or tempted to use, chat platforms such as Telegram or\nDiscord.\n\nArchived Discussions\nArchived discussions are discussions of interest that happen outside the Particl\nforum but are archived on it. The reason these discussions are getting archived\non the Particl Forum [https://particl.community/tags/archive] is that they are\nthought of as constructive, interesting, and in general, adding value to the\nbroader Particl discussion.\n\nAs mentioned throughout this post, many of the platforms we are on (i.e.\nTelegram, Discord, etc) are not ideal when it comes to preserving discussions\nand making them easily accessible. Particl Forum, on the other hand, offers a\nmuch more structured way of preserving and categorizing discussions or thoughts,\nhence why we believe noteworthy discussions should be made easily available for\nall to see, even if it has been weeks or months since they happened.\n\nNote: There is no “Archives” category. We prefer putting every archived\ndiscussion within the category it fits in to make them easier to find. You can,\nhowever, simply select the archive [https://particl.community/tags/archive] tag\nto filter all the forum posts and only display archived posts. To do so, go to\nthe main page of the forum and select archive\n[https://particl.community/tags/archive] as the tag filter.\n\nFor more information about archived discussions, visit this thread: \nhttps://particl.community/t/what-are-archived-discussions/79\n\nFor a good example of an archived discussions, read What is Dandelion?\n[https://particl.community/t/what-is-dandelion/78]\n\nSelf-Governance\nAn interesting feature of the Discourse platform is that it allows, not too\nunlike Particl Marketplace, the community to govern itself. In fact, Discourse\nincludes a trust system as well as a flagging/report system that can hide\ninappropriate posts once they reach a certain threshold calculated by crunching\ntogether trust levels and numbers of flags. Users that reach trust level 4, the\nhighest trust level, are even granted limited moderating powers which allow them\nto keep the environment clean when no moderators are around. After all, users\ntrust level 4 are those trusted ones that have been hanging around the forum for\nthe most time and have made quality contributions to it.\n\nTo learn more about Discourse’s self-governance mechanism, read this article\nposted on the official Discourse blog: \nhttps://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/\n\nParticl Proposal Discussions\nAs many of you already know, our development team has been working on the \nProject Governance mechanism that will allow any Particl users to create,\nsubmit, and vote on proposals directly within the Particl Desktop wallet\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6].\nParticl Desktop does not, however, support proposal discussions. These proposal\ndiscussions and debates are expected to be vital to the voting and consensus\nreaching process and would benefit a lot from a more organized way to go about\nthem.\n\nThe Particl forum contains a Proposals\n[https://particl.community/c/general-discussion/proposals] sub-category within\nthe General [https://particl.community/c/general-discussion] category. Because\nParticl Desktop allows users to link to an external discussion thread, it is\nrecommended that users first submit their proposal on the forum and then submit\nit to the network (with the link to the discussion thread included in the\nsubmission). This will help people easily find the thread dedicated to a\nspecific proposal and discuss what’s being proposed in a well-structured fashion\nand for all voters to see.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFun Social Features\nNot only is Discourse full of useful features, but it’s also full of fun and\nsocial features! In fact, we’ve added a lot of plugins to the vanilla version of\nDiscourse, including a custom-theme, that makes hanging on the Particl forum a\nreal treat.\n\nUser Cards\nCryptoguard’s User CardUser cards are a small profile summary attached to every\nuser that can be displayed simply by clicking on the user’s avatar. They display\na lot of useful information about the user in question such as social media\nplatform usernames, forum statistics, title, and badges. They allow users to\nquickly preview another user’s profile without requiring to quit the page or\nthread they’re currently on. This is an excellent way to display your forum\nachievements and activity to the rest of the community as well as making\nyourself easier to reach out to on any platform you’re on!\n\nBadges\nA few examples of custom badges made for the Particl forumBadges are forum\n“achievements” you acquire throughout your journey on the Particl forum and are\nmeant to showcase to the rest of the community your involvement within the\nproject. On top of the default badges included in the vanilla version of\nDiscourse, we’ve added a few of them (such as Wiki Contributor, Alpha Tester, \nBug Finder, Coin Swapper, and etc) to highlight some of our own milestones and\ncommunity achievements. They are an excellent way to build a reputation for\nyourself and showcase your support and involvement in the project! For a list of\nthe currently available badges, visit the forum’s badges page\n[https://particl.community/badges]. Note that more badges will be added as we\nmove forward and receive suggestions from the community.\n\nReactions\nYou can react to posts and threads the same way you can do it on Discord or\nSlack. Indeed, on top of the “like” function that comes with the default version\nof Discourse, we’ve added a plugin which allows users to “react” on posts using\nany emojis. Don’t be afraid to show how you feel about a certain post! ?\n\nPolls\nExample of a poll within a threadPolls are going to be useful for anyone that\nwants to poll the community about a certain issue, matter, or question. Up until\nnow, polls were exclusively held on either Twitter or Discord (using “reacts”),\na set up that wasn’t optimal. In fact, if you didn’t have a Twitter account, you\ncouldn’t vote on Twitter polls. If the poll was held instead on Discord, it was\ngetting buried by the constant chatter within only a few hours. Discord polls\nalso do not allow for very complex sets of options.\n\nWith the Particl forum’s polling feature, polls can now be properly referenced\nby a link and are opened to every member of the community. Yes, you will need a\nforum account to participate, but it is, in the end, a much more private\nsolution (don’t need to provide a phone number, unlike Twitter), convenient\n(doesn’t get buried, can be easily linked to and shared), and flexible (can put\nmany options and include much more details) way to do it.\n\nSwap Angels\nBack when the community decided to go ahead with the Community Initiative to\naccommodate late swappers\n[https://particl.news/a-community-driven-initiative-e26724100c3a], it was\ndiscussed within the community that the people who would donate may, possibly,\nreceive some kind of flair or special mention as a token of appreciation. As we\nslowly, but surely, head towards the mainnet release of the long-awaited Particl\nMarketplace, we believe that now would be a great time to celebrate our generous\nveteran holders who have donated some of their personal funds to help and rescue\nlate swappers.\n\nAs of today, donors to the initiative will be able to display a special badge, \nflair, title or any combination of those on their profile and user card. These\noptional options can be granted to donors’ Particl forum accounts simply by\nsending a message containing your Particl Portal username as well as whether you\nwould like to be displayed on the Hall of Fame thread or not to Cryptoguard\n[https://particl.community/u/cryptoguard/summary].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional Resources\nTutorial\nIf you would like to follow an interactive tutorial that will show you the basic\nfunctions of Discourse, simply read the message from @discobot that you will\nautomatically receive in your inbox upon signing up and follow through his\ninstructions. The bot will guide you through all the basic stuff through an\ninteractive tutorial and help you get started!\n\nDiscourse\nDiscourse’s Official Website [https://www.discourse.org/]\n\nDiscourse Vanilla Features [https://www.discourse.org/features.html]\n\nNew User Tips & Tricks\n[https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-new-user-tips-and-tricks/54341/20]\n\nUnderstanding Trust Levels\n[https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/]\n\nFormatting Help [https://commonmark.org/help/]\n\nParticl Forum\nParticl Forum Link [https://particl.community]\n\nArchived Discussions [https://particl.community/tags/archive]\n\nParticl Proposals [https://particl.community/c/general-discussion/proposals]\n\nBadges Page [https://particl.community/badges]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo now that you are done reading this introduction post, it’s time to #BePART of\nthe discourse!

As such, we have ported our <a href=\"http://particl.wiki\">Particl Wiki</a>’s FAQ into a <a href=\"https://particl.community/t/frequently-asked-questions-faq/43/2\"><strong>pinned thread</strong></a> so that users could easily answer the most frequently asked questions by themselves or ask their questions, if they are not already included, as a reply to the FAQ thread so that it could be added to it upon resolving.</p><p>Moreover, the forum format is used around the world and is a very popular and instinctive platform to grow communities on.

Particl Forum, on the other hand, offers a much more structured way of preserving and categorizing discussions or thoughts, hence why we believe noteworthy discussions should be made easily available for all to see, even if it has been weeks or months since they happened.</p><p><em><strong>Note: </strong></em><em>There is no “Archives” category.

In fact, Discourse includes a trust system as well as a flagging/report system that can hide inappropriate posts once they reach a certain threshold calculated by crunching together trust levels and numbers of flags. Users that reach trust level 4, the highest trust level, are even granted limited moderating powers which allow them to keep the environment clean when no moderators are around. After all, users trust level 4 are those trusted ones that have been hanging around the forum for the most time and have made quality contributions to it.</p><p>To learn more about Discourse’s self-governance mechanism, read this article posted on the official Discourse blog: <a href=\"https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/\">https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/</a></p><h3 id=\"particl-proposal-discussions\">Particl Proposal Discussions</h3><p>As many of you already know, our development team has been working on the <a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\">Project Governance mechanism that will allow any Particl users to create, submit, and vote on proposals directly within the Particl Desktop wallet</a>. Particl Desktop does not, however, support proposal discussions. These proposal discussions and debates are expected to be vital to the voting and consensus reaching process and would benefit a lot from a more organized way to go about them.</p><p>The Particl forum contains a <a href=\"https://particl.community/c/general-discussion/proposals\"><strong>Proposals</strong></a><strong> </strong>sub-category within the <a href=\"https://particl.community/c/general-discussion\"><strong>General</strong></a> category. Because Particl Desktop allows users to link to an external discussion thread, it is recommended that users first submit their proposal on the forum and then submit it to the network (with the link to the discussion thread included in the submission). This will help people easily find the thread dedicated to a specific proposal and discuss what’s being proposed in a well-structured fashion and for all voters to see.</p><hr><h2 id=\"fun-social-features\"><strong>Fun Social Features</strong></h2><p>Not only is Discourse full of useful features, but it’s also full of <strong>fun and social </strong>features!

Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\n(4:50 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=4m50s]) Could you start communicating a\nbit about the upcoming funding round?\nWe’ve stated in the past that our lead group will be discussing the next funding\nround when we meet later this year. To be honest, we haven’t had any formal\ncommunication on it, only thoughts and ideas were bounced around and we will try\nto share those with the community as they come up. The second funding round will\nbe one of the main talking points of our next team meeting and we’ll have a plan\nof attack after that time.\n\n(6:14 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=6m14s]) You said you want to rise about 20\nmillion USD, you only have around 1 million coins to sell for the second\nfunding round…\nThe numbers that we have gathered over a year history of managing a\ndecentralized team and with a good array of active and future products make us\nfeel comfortable in seeking $20 million in funding. That number, although could\nchange, would be all that is needed to ensure the continuous development of the\nParticl project for as long as people want to use its privacy-focused and\ndecentralized applications.\n\n(8:10 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=8m10s]) I am wondering if the low price of\nthe particl coin is an issue for this funding round\nIn order to raise around $20 million dollars, the price of the Particl coin\nwould indeed need to be at or around 20 dollars. This will be taken into account\nduring our next team meeting when we craft our funding strategy. We may also,\nshould we have enough funds left from the previous funding round, postpone the\nfunding round until more favorable market conditions arise. In other words,\nthere is nothing set in stone yet and we will keep the community updated with\nthe funding structure as we move forward after the meeting.\n\n(9:14 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=9m14s]) How many investors will\nparticipate in this funding round?\nWe have a collection of inquiries that have already voiced an interest and\nreached out to us about the funding round. This will 99% most likely be a\nprivate funding round, not an ICO or community funding event. That will be\nnailed down, as with the rest of the funding strategy, during our next team\nmeeting later this year.\n\n(10:24 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=10m24s]) If we have only one (or a few)\ninvestors, then a very large part of the supply will be held by one (or a few)\nholders. Any thoughts on this?\nWe’ve discussed (again, just brainstorming at this point) having PART lots with\nminimum and maximum buy orders per investment group. For example, a minimum\ncould be 1,000 PART lots or the max could be 10,000 PART lots. We don’t know yet\nhow exactly we’ll be going on about it but it’ll absolutely be done in a manner\nthat respects the integrity of the network, its decentralization as well as its\ncommunity, even if that means ruling our some potential investors that’d be a\nbit a too aggressive in their tactics.\n\n(11:55 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=11m55s]) I think these coins being put in\ncirculation could scare future buyers. Do you plan to set some specific rules so\nthese investors cannot dump their coins on the market?\nWe haven’t talked anything about the terms & conditions of the round. Typically\nprivate investment rounds have rules and participants are less impulsive than\ndaytraders or casual investors. Details will be worked out with our legal teams\ntoo, but again, this has yet to happen. As mentioned above, everything will be\ndone in the most responsible manner possible and will put the integrity and\nhealth of the network first.\n\n(13:57 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=13m57s]) Do you have any kind of plan B\nin case you can’t raise the amount you need?\nThere are two scenarios that could happen. The first one is that we can’t raise\nthe amount we need to and then have to postpone any funding round until the\nmarket conditions (or the investor pool) are more favorable. Note that, as we\nhave secured the salaries and funds required to support the project until at\nleast April of next year, that leaves a lot of time for market conditions to\nturn around and for Particl to turn some heads. It is also far from excluded\nthat these funds could last for longer than that, so in reality, there could\nstill be quite a long time until the moment the project outright requires more\nfunds to survive.\n\nThe second scenario is that the market conditions are more than favorable, we\nraise the amount that we are seeking to raise, but don’t use the full 996,000\nPART coins to do so. This would present more options to improve the network by\npossibly conducting a burn event of the extra PART coins that weren’t required,\nor set up new funds for marketing, community stimulation, development, events,\nphilanthropy, acquisitions, even a fund for future funding rounds, and etc. This\nwould present itself as the ideal scenario as that would give us an unlimited\nnumber of options on how to best spend these leftover funds.\n\n(18:44 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=18m44s]) The word on Discord is that\nstaking pools will be available soon — any information or ETA on that?\nTecnovert has been working on staking pools on both testnet and mainnet\nnetworks. He has gotten rather far so far with it but it is still in testing\nmode. We may be able to see or participate in some of the testing on the testnet\none at some point in time soon.\n\nAs for an ETA, it’s pretty hard to tell as he may very well switch back over to\nRingCT and planning the upcoming hardfork as we near that event. RingCT is ready\nfor mainnet and the governance bit (see the Status Report\n[https://particl.io/status-report] and this tweet\n[https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1037773807145181185]) is moving\nsmoothly.\n\nLong story short, higher priorities may pull him away from staking pools, but\nyes, there are prototypes.\n\n(23:29 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=23m29s]) How is it possible that the\nremaining funds from the first funding round will only last until April 2019?\nTo clarify, the funds going to April 2019 are only salaries which were hedged in\nadvance to ensure that we could pay contributors in the case of any crazy market\nhappenings (see 2018). There is, of course, more funds in the Particl Foundation\ncoffers which could be requested by the Particl team should it need additional\nfundings to cover salaries and operations past April 2019.\n\n(28:46 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=28m46s]) How can one pay for services\nsuch as featuring or highlighting their products on Particl Marketplace?\nThis is not going to be part of the initial version of Particl Marketplace on\nmainnet, but we see this feature as being very useful. It is not something\nthat’s part of our roadmap, yet, and it might come faster if some third-party\ndeveloper builds it using the coming SDK tools, but we might end up tackling it\nourselves at some point in the future. Vendors are going to want tools to\npromote themselves and increase their sales, we are aware of this and will be\nsomething that is most probably end up being part of Particl, whether it’s part\nof Particl Desktop or third-party services like Mubiz\n[https://particl.news/interview-with-albin-from-mubiz-a-web-interface-suite-of-services-designed-for-particl-decb9a56ecbe]\n, for example!\n\n(32:31 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=32m31s]) Will the marketplace\nhave reviews?\nThere will probably be reviews and it is planned in some form or another. It’s\nnot part of our roadmap just yet but is something we’ve identified as something\nwe want to work on eventually. There is still a lot of research that needs to be\ndone in order to make it as efficient and accurate as possible (i.e. make it\nharder to fake reviews), and also do so in a way that entirely preserves users’\nidentities.\n\n(34:30 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=34m30s]) Will it have a user reputation\nmechanism?\nIt is still a floating idea, but we may never have a reputation system if it\nproves to be detrimental to one’s privacy/security (since we are, after all, a\nprivacy-focused project). It also might be hard to do without it being able to\nbe gamed by users which would thus make it more or less useless. As we stand\nright now, we are tentatively opting for a model that is going to make use of\ngovernance paired with reviews rather than a “reputation” system.\n\n(39:01 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=39m1s]) Does PART have a reorganization\nlimit making long range attacks impossible?\nParticl Proof-of-Stake doesn’t have a reorganization limit. This attack is\nmostly based on weak subjectivity which only works if a bad actor convinced the\nother nodes to download a modified client from a bad source. While they might\nhave the resources to reorganize the blocks, they’d also need to trick people\ninto using their own client and not the official one. This is one of the reasons\nwe very strongly recommend downloading Particl clients directly from our \nofficial website [http://particl.io/downloads] or from our Github page\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases] as well as always \nverifying the integrity of your downloaded Particl files\n[https://particl.wiki/howto-verify-downloads].\n\nMore technical details revealed by Paul here\n[https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=39m1s].\n\n(43:36 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=41m15s]) Does it have Economic Clustering\nwhich makes it possible for forgers to detect forks early and switch to the\nchain where the other important nodes are?\n​Economic Clusters is a counter-measure to the stake griding and basically\nincludes the ID of one of the recent blocks so that peers need to be on the same\nchain to validate. PoSv3, thus Particl Proof-of-Stake, which is vaguely based on\nit, fixed this issue with dynamic stake modifier although it still is not the\nend all-fix all. Here are two quotes from our developers on the matter:\n\n> Tecnovert: PoSv3 removes the possibility that someone could save up stakeweight\nover time — that made it a lot easier for someone to save a large amount of part\nfor a few months and have enough saved weight to rewrite a few blocks in\nsuccession. A 500 block reorganization limit (for example) wouldn’t have stopped\nthat though”Dasource “ I agree…I wonder what the other rationale was behind\nit...since most attacks related to stake weight would have been less than a\ndozen blocks in which case it would have never helped as the default setting (in\npre-PoSv3 versions) was 500”\n\nMore technical details revealed by Paul here\n[https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=41m15s].\n\n(47:35 [https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=47m35s]) Is Particl making any effort\ninto researching and improving Proof-of-Stake?\nWhile the team is not solely focusing on working on Proof-of-stake and making a\nPoSv4, we are still improving our own PoS mechanism by making it more secure\nthan most of its counterpart. Cold staking\n[https://decentralize.today/particls-10th-of-november-hardfork-cold-staking-quantum-resistance-a083ef3913cc] \nis one such example, which allows users to stake their funds without requiring\nto expose their public keys (when signing staked blocks). Moreover, if users\nchoose to use cold staking in combination with a Ledger hardware wallet\n[https://particl.news/how-to-stake-your-funds-stored-on-a-hardware-device-ledger-nano-s-e6fbe7828495]\n, their private keys also do not need to be exposed to any computer ever,\ndramatically increasing the security of Proof-of-Stake which actually usually\nrequires users to expose both these keys at some point or the other along the\nstaking process.\n\nThe Particl development team doesn’t currently spend time on Proof-of-Stake\nresearch specifically, but it is always aware of the developments going on\naround the scene and seeks to make Particl Proof-of-Stake one of the most, if\nnot the most, secure Proof-of-Stake algorithm. Security is, after all, one of\nour core values which are reflected in all aspects of the project.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nNew Status Report\nA new Status Report [http://particl.io/status-report] was posted on the 31st of\nAugust, highlighting the good development progress made to the project.\n\nParticl.io — Status Report [https://particl.io/status-report/]\n[https://particl.io/status-report/]particl.io\n[https://particl.io/status-report/]\n\nProject Governance (Community Proposals): The Project Governance mechanism\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6] is\nnow marked as Completed and has made its way onto the public testnet\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1126].

Mubiz already offers services to\nthe OpenBazaar community and plans on extending its business over to the Particl\nprotocol. In this interview, he reveals how Mubiz will help make Particl as easy\nto use as any other online eCommerce platform by providing a wide range of\nservices such as shipping management, escrow management for buyers (no double\ndeposit required from users), traditional means of payments such as\nbanking/credit cards, Paypal, and etc, reviews, and much more.

That number, although could change, would be all that is needed to ensure the continuous development of the Particl project for as long as people want to use its privacy-focused and decentralized applications.</p><h3 id=\"-8-10-i-am-wondering-if-the-low-price-of-the-particl-coin-is-an-issue-for-this-funding-round\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=8m10s\">8:10</a>) I am wondering if the low price of the particl coin is an issue for this funding round</h3><p>In order to raise around $20 million dollars, the price of the Particl coin would indeed need to be at or around 20 dollars. This will be taken into account during our next team meeting when we craft our funding strategy. We may also, should we have enough funds left from the previous funding round, postpone the funding round until more favorable market conditions arise. In other words, there is nothing set in stone yet and we will keep the community updated with the funding structure as we move forward after the meeting.</p><h3 id=\"-9-14-how-many-investors-will-participate-in-this-funding-round\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=9m14s\">9:14</a>) How many investors will participate in this funding round?</h3><p>We have a collection of inquiries that have already voiced an interest and reached out to us about the funding round. This will 99% most likely be a private funding round, not an ICO or community funding event. That will be nailed down, as with the rest of the funding strategy, during our next team meeting later this year.</p><h3 id=\"-10-24-if-we-have-only-one-or-a-few-investors-then-a-very-large-part-of-the-supply-will-be-held-by-one-or-a-few-holders-any-thoughts-on-this\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=10m24s\">10:24</a>) If we have only one (or a few) investors, then a very large part of the supply will be held by one (or a few) holders. Any thoughts on this?</h3><p>We’ve discussed (again, just brainstorming at this point) having PART lots with minimum and maximum buy orders per investment group. For example, a minimum could be 1,000 PART lots or the max could be 10,000 PART lots. We don’t know yet how exactly we’ll be going on about it but it’ll absolutely be done in a manner that respects the integrity of the network, its decentralization as well as its community, even if that means ruling our some potential investors that’d be a bit a too aggressive in their tactics.</p><h3 id=\"-11-55-i-think-these-coins-being-put-in-circulation-could-scare-future-buyers-do-you-plan-to-set-some-specific-rules-so-these-investors-cannot-dump-their-coins-on-the-market\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=11m55s\">11:55</a>) I think these coins being put in circulation could scare future buyers. Do you plan to set some specific rules so these investors cannot dump their coins on the market?</h3><p>We haven’t talked anything about the terms &amp; conditions of the round. Typically private investment rounds have rules and participants are less impulsive than daytraders or casual investors. Details will be worked out with our legal teams too, but again, this has yet to happen. As mentioned above, everything will be done in the most responsible manner possible and will put the integrity and health of the network first.</p><h3 id=\"-13-57-do-you-have-any-kind-of-plan-b-in-case-you-can-t-raise-the-amount-you-need\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=13m57s\">13:57</a>) Do you have any kind of plan B in case you can’t raise the amount you need?</h3><p>There are two scenarios that could happen. The first one is that we can’t raise the amount we need to and then have to postpone any funding round until the market conditions (or the investor pool) are more favorable. Note that, as we have secured the salaries and funds required to support the project until at least April of next year, that leaves a lot of time for market conditions to turn around and for Particl to turn some heads. It is also far from excluded that these funds could last for longer than that, so in reality, there could still be quite a long time until the moment the project outright requires more funds to survive.</p><p>The second scenario is that the market conditions are more than favorable, we raise the amount that we are seeking to raise, but don’t use the full 996,000 PART coins to do so. This would present more options to improve the network by possibly conducting a burn event of the extra PART coins that weren’t required, or set up new funds for marketing, community stimulation, development, events, philanthropy, acquisitions, even a fund for future funding rounds, and etc. This would present itself as the ideal scenario as that would give us an unlimited number of options on how to best spend these leftover funds.</p><h3 id=\"-18-44-the-word-on-discord-is-that-staking-pools-will-be-available-soon-any-information-or-eta-on-that\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=18m44s\">18:44</a>) The word on Discord is that staking pools will be available soon — any information or ETA on that?</h3><p>Tecnovert has been working on staking pools on both testnet and mainnet networks. He has gotten rather far so far with it but it is still in testing mode. We may be able to see or participate in some of the testing on the testnet one at some point in time soon.</p><p>As for an ETA, it’s pretty hard to tell as he may very well switch back over to RingCT and planning the upcoming hardfork as we near that event. RingCT is ready for mainnet and the governance bit (see the <a href=\"https://particl.io/status-report\">Status Report</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1037773807145181185\">this tweet</a>) is moving smoothly.</p><p>Long story short, higher priorities may pull him away from staking pools, but yes, there are prototypes.</p><h3 id=\"-23-29-how-is-it-possible-that-the-remaining-funds-from-the-first-funding-round-will-only-last-until-april-2019\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=23m29s\">23:29</a>) How is it possible that the remaining funds from the first funding round will only last until April 2019?</h3><p>To clarify, the funds going to April 2019 are only salaries which were hedged in advance to ensure that we could pay contributors in the case of any crazy market happenings (see 2018). There is, of course, more funds in the Particl Foundation coffers which could be requested by the Particl team should it need additional fundings to cover salaries and operations past April 2019.</p><h3 id=\"-28-46-how-can-one-pay-for-services-such-as-featuring-or-highlighting-their-products-on-particl-marketplace\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=28m46s\">28:46</a>) How can one pay for services such as featuring or highlighting their products on Particl Marketplace?</h3><p>This is not going to be part of the initial version of Particl Marketplace on mainnet, but we see this feature as being very useful. It is not something that’s part of our roadmap, yet, and it might come faster if some third-party developer builds it using the coming SDK tools, but we might end up tackling it ourselves at some point in the future. Vendors are going to want tools to promote themselves and increase their sales, we are aware of this and will be something that is most probably end up being part of Particl, whether it’s part of Particl Desktop or third-party services like <a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-albin-from-mubiz-a-web-interface-suite-of-services-designed-for-particl-decb9a56ecbe\">Mubiz</a>, for example!</p><h3 id=\"-32-31-will-the-marketplace-have-reviews\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=32m31s\">32:31</a>) Will the marketplace have reviews?</h3><p>There will probably be reviews and it is planned in some form or another. It’s not part of our roadmap just yet but is something we’ve identified as something we want to work on eventually. There is still a lot of research that needs to be done in order to make it as efficient and accurate as possible (i.e. make it harder to fake reviews), and also do so in a way that entirely preserves users’ identities.</p><h3 id=\"-34-30-will-it-have-a-user-reputation-mechanism\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=34m30s\">34:30</a>) Will it have a user reputation mechanism?</h3><p>It is still a floating idea, but we may never have a reputation system if it proves to be detrimental to one’s privacy/security (since we are, after all, a privacy-focused project). It also might be hard to do without it being able to be gamed by users which would thus make it more or less useless. As we stand right now, we are tentatively opting for a model that is going to make use of governance paired with reviews rather than a “reputation” system.</p><h3 id=\"-39-01-does-part-have-a-reorganization-limit-making-long-range-attacks-impossible\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=39m1s\">39:01</a>) Does PART have a reorganization limit making long range attacks impossible?</h3><p>Particl Proof-of-Stake doesn’t have a reorganization limit. This attack is mostly based on weak subjectivity which only works if a bad actor convinced the other nodes to download a modified client from a bad source. While they might have the resources to reorganize the blocks, they’d also need to trick people into using their own client and not the official one. This is one of the reasons we very strongly recommend downloading Particl clients directly from our <a href=\"http://particl.io/downloads\">official website</a> or from our <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases\">Github page</a> as well as always <a href=\"https://particl.wiki/howto-verify-downloads\">verifying the integrity of your downloaded Particl files</a>.</p><p><em>More technical details revealed by Paul </em><a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=39m1s\"><em><strong>here</strong></em></a><em>.</em></p><h3 id=\"-43-36-does-it-have-economic-clustering-which-makes-it-possible-for-forgers-to-detect-forks-early-and-switch-to-the-chain-where-the-other-important-nodes-are\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=41m15s\">43:36</a>) Does it have Economic Clustering which makes it possible for forgers to detect forks early and switch to the chain where the other important nodes are?</h3><p>​Economic Clusters is a counter-measure to the stake griding and basically includes the ID of one of the recent blocks so that peers need to be on the same chain to validate. PoSv3, thus Particl Proof-of-Stake, which is vaguely based on it, fixed this issue with dynamic stake modifier although it still is not the end all-fix all. Here are two quotes from our developers on the matter:</p><blockquote><strong>Tecnovert:</strong> PoSv3 removes the possibility that someone could save up stakeweight over time — that made it a lot easier for someone to save a large amount of part for a few months and have enough saved weight to rewrite a few blocks in succession. A 500 block reorganization limit (for example) wouldn’t have stopped that though”<strong>Dasource</strong> “ I agree…I wonder what the other rationale was behind it...since most attacks related to stake weight would have been less than a dozen blocks in which case it would have never helped as the default setting (in pre-PoSv3 versions) was 500”<br></blockquote><p><em>More technical details revealed by Paul </em><a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=41m15s\"><em><strong>here</strong></em></a><em>.</em></p><h3 id=\"-47-35-is-particl-making-any-effort-into-researching-and-improving-proof-of-stake\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=47m35s\">47:35</a>) Is Particl making any effort into researching and improving Proof-of-Stake?</h3><p>While the team is not solely focusing on working on Proof-of-stake and making a PoSv4, we are still improving our own PoS mechanism by making it more secure than most of its counterpart. <a href=\"https://decentralize.today/particls-10th-of-november-hardfork-cold-staking-quantum-resistance-a083ef3913cc\">Cold staking</a> is one such example, which allows users to stake their funds without requiring to expose their public keys (when signing staked blocks). Moreover, if users choose to <a href=\"https://particl.news/how-to-stake-your-funds-stored-on-a-hardware-device-ledger-nano-s-e6fbe7828495\">use cold staking in combination with a Ledger hardware wallet</a>, their private keys also do not need to be exposed to any computer ever, dramatically increasing the security of Proof-of-Stake which actually usually requires users to expose both these keys at some point or the other along the staking process.</p><p>The Particl development team doesn’t currently spend time on Proof-of-Stake research specifically, but it is always aware of the developments going on around the scene and seeks to make Particl Proof-of-Stake one of the most, if not the most, secure Proof-of-Stake algorithm. Security is, after all, one of our core values which are reflected in <strong>all</strong> aspects of the project.</p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &amp; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"new-status-report\">New Status Report</h3><p>A new <a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report\">Status Report</a> was posted on the 31st of August, highlighting the good development progress made to the project.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.io/status-report/\"><strong>Particl.io — Status Report</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.io/status-report/\"><em> </em></a><a href=\"https://particl.io/status-report/\">particl.io</a></p><p><strong>Project Governance (Community Proposals): </strong>The <a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\">Project Governance mechanism</a> is now marked as <em>Completed </em>and has <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1126\">made its way onto the public testnet</a>.

It is also far from excluded that these funds could last for longer than that, so in reality, there could still be quite a long time until the moment the project outright requires more funds to survive.</p><p>The second scenario is that the market conditions are more than favorable, we raise the amount that we are seeking to raise, but don’t use the full 996,000 PART coins to do so. This would present more options to improve the network by possibly conducting a burn event of the extra PART coins that weren’t required, or set up new funds for marketing, community stimulation, development, events, philanthropy, acquisitions, even a fund for future funding rounds, and etc. This would present itself as the ideal scenario as that would give us an unlimited number of options on how to best spend these leftover funds.</p><h3 id=\"-18-44-the-word-on-discord-is-that-staking-pools-will-be-available-soon-any-information-or-eta-on-that\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=18m44s\">18:44</a>) The word on Discord is that staking pools will be available soon — any information or ETA on that?</h3><p>Tecnovert has been working on staking pools on both testnet and mainnet networks. He has gotten rather far so far with it but it is still in testing mode. We may be able to see or participate in some of the testing on the testnet one at some point in time soon.</p><p>As for an ETA, it’s pretty hard to tell as he may very well switch back over to RingCT and planning the upcoming hardfork as we near that event. RingCT is ready for mainnet and the governance bit (see the <a href=\"https://particl.io/status-report\">Status Report</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1037773807145181185\">this tweet</a>) is moving smoothly.</p><p>Long story short, higher priorities may pull him away from staking pools, but yes, there are prototypes.</p><h3 id=\"-23-29-how-is-it-possible-that-the-remaining-funds-from-the-first-funding-round-will-only-last-until-april-2019\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=23m29s\">23:29</a>) How is it possible that the remaining funds from the first funding round will only last until April 2019?</h3><p>To clarify, the funds going to April 2019 are only salaries which were hedged in advance to ensure that we could pay contributors in the case of any crazy market happenings (see 2018). There is, of course, more funds in the Particl Foundation coffers which could be requested by the Particl team should it need additional fundings to cover salaries and operations past April 2019.</p><h3 id=\"-28-46-how-can-one-pay-for-services-such-as-featuring-or-highlighting-their-products-on-particl-marketplace\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=28m46s\">28:46</a>) How can one pay for services such as featuring or highlighting their products on Particl Marketplace?</h3><p>This is not going to be part of the initial version of Particl Marketplace on mainnet, but we see this feature as being very useful. It is not something that’s part of our roadmap, yet, and it might come faster if some third-party developer builds it using the coming SDK tools, but we might end up tackling it ourselves at some point in the future. Vendors are going to want tools to promote themselves and increase their sales, we are aware of this and will be something that is most probably end up being part of Particl, whether it’s part of Particl Desktop or third-party services like <a href=\"https://particl.news/interview-with-albin-from-mubiz-a-web-interface-suite-of-services-designed-for-particl-decb9a56ecbe\">Mubiz</a>, for example!</p><h3 id=\"-32-31-will-the-marketplace-have-reviews\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=32m31s\">32:31</a>) Will the marketplace have reviews?</h3><p>There will probably be reviews and it is planned in some form or another. It’s not part of our roadmap just yet but is something we’ve identified as something we want to work on eventually. There is still a lot of research that needs to be done in order to make it as efficient and accurate as possible (i.e. make it harder to fake reviews), and also do so in a way that entirely preserves users’ identities.</p><h3 id=\"-34-30-will-it-have-a-user-reputation-mechanism\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=34m30s\">34:30</a>) Will it have a user reputation mechanism?</h3><p>It is still a floating idea, but we may never have a reputation system if it proves to be detrimental to one’s privacy/security (since we are, after all, a privacy-focused project). It also might be hard to do without it being able to be gamed by users which would thus make it more or less useless. As we stand right now, we are tentatively opting for a model that is going to make use of governance paired with reviews rather than a “reputation” system.</p><h3 id=\"-39-01-does-part-have-a-reorganization-limit-making-long-range-attacks-impossible\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=39m1s\">39:01</a>) Does PART have a reorganization limit making long range attacks impossible?</h3><p>Particl Proof-of-Stake doesn’t have a reorganization limit. This attack is mostly based on weak subjectivity which only works if a bad actor convinced the other nodes to download a modified client from a bad source. While they might have the resources to reorganize the blocks, they’d also need to trick people into using their own client and not the official one. This is one of the reasons we very strongly recommend downloading Particl clients directly from our <a href=\"http://particl.io/downloads\">official website</a> or from our <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases\">Github page</a> as well as always <a href=\"https://particl.wiki/howto-verify-downloads\">verifying the integrity of your downloaded Particl files</a>.</p><p><em>More technical details revealed by Paul </em><a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=39m1s\"><em><strong>here</strong></em></a><em>.</em></p><h3 id=\"-43-36-does-it-have-economic-clustering-which-makes-it-possible-for-forgers-to-detect-forks-early-and-switch-to-the-chain-where-the-other-important-nodes-are\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=41m15s\">43:36</a>) Does it have Economic Clustering which makes it possible for forgers to detect forks early and switch to the chain where the other important nodes are?</h3><p>​Economic Clusters is a counter-measure to the stake griding and basically includes the ID of one of the recent blocks so that peers need to be on the same chain to validate. PoSv3, thus Particl Proof-of-Stake, which is vaguely based on it, fixed this issue with dynamic stake modifier although it still is not the end all-fix all. Here are two quotes from our developers on the matter:</p><blockquote><strong>Tecnovert:</strong> PoSv3 removes the possibility that someone could save up stakeweight over time — that made it a lot easier for someone to save a large amount of part for a few months and have enough saved weight to rewrite a few blocks in succession. A 500 block reorganization limit (for example) wouldn’t have stopped that though”<strong>Dasource</strong> “ I agree…I wonder what the other rationale was behind it...since most attacks related to stake weight would have been less than a dozen blocks in which case it would have never helped as the default setting (in pre-PoSv3 versions) was 500”<br></blockquote><p><em>More technical details revealed by Paul </em><a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=41m15s\"><em><strong>here</strong></em></a><em>.</em></p><h3 id=\"-47-35-is-particl-making-any-effort-into-researching-and-improving-proof-of-stake\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/QEhS2Ugiu6g?t=47m35s\">47:35</a>) Is Particl making any effort into researching and improving Proof-of-Stake?</h3><p>While the team is not solely focusing on working on Proof-of-stake and making a PoSv4, we are still improving our own PoS mechanism by making it more secure than most of its counterpart. <a href=\"https://decentralize.today/particls-10th-of-november-hardfork-cold-staking-quantum-resistance-a083ef3913cc\">Cold staking</a> is one such example, which allows users to stake their funds without requiring to expose their public keys (when signing staked blocks). Moreover, if users choose to <a href=\"https://particl.news/how-to-stake-your-funds-stored-on-a-hardware-device-ledger-nano-s-e6fbe7828495\">use cold staking in combination with a Ledger hardware wallet</a>, their private keys also do not need to be exposed to any computer ever, dramatically increasing the security of Proof-of-Stake which actually usually requires users to expose both these keys at some point or the other along the staking process.</p><p>The Particl development team doesn’t currently spend time on Proof-of-Stake research specifically, but it is always aware of the developments going on around the scene and seeks to make Particl Proof-of-Stake one of the most, if not the most, secure Proof-of-Stake algorithm. Security is, after all, one of our core values which are reflected in <strong>all</strong> aspects of the project.</p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &#x26; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"new-status-report\">New Status Report</h3><p>A new <a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report\">Status Report</a> was posted on the 31st of August, highlighting the good development progress made to the project.</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.io/status-report/\"><strong>Particl.io — Status Report</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.io/status-report/\"><em> </em></a><a href=\"https://particl.io/status-report/\">particl.io</a></p><p><strong>Project Governance (Community Proposals): </strong>The <a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\">Project Governance mechanism</a> is now marked as <em>Completed </em>and has <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1126\">made its way onto the public testnet</a>.

Within this short\nperiod of time, a lot has been accomplished by our development team, as\ndocumented in these two recapitulation articles (1\n[https://particl.news/particl-2017-year-in-review-b9984b8ce797], 2\n[https://particl.news/particl-genesis-anniversary-b2d4ceff1f95]) as well as our\nnow bi-weekly Community Updates (1\n[https://particl.news/particl-community-update-1-d80c1d3201f5], 2\n[https://particl.news/community-update-2-9525cd94bade], 3\n[https://particl.news/community-update-3-407404771f11], 4\n[https://particl.news/community-update-4-1df4f5aafe5f], 5\n[https://particl.news/project-update-5-bf6f510a538c]). In fact, the Particl\nproject has grown into an impressive network full of technological innovations.\nWhile some of the innovations are currently available on mainnet (Particl\nDesktop, cold staking, Ledger staking, Confidential Transactions, atomic swaps,\nand etc), most of the really impressive stuff (decentralized marketplace,\ntrustless MAD escrow system, decentralized project governance, decentralized\nmarketplace governance, staking pool, etc) either currently only resides on\nParticl’s public testnet or in developers’ personal repositories and still under\nheavy development.\n\nSome crypto rating agencies have taken notice of the prowesses our development\nteam has pulled off. For example, Particl consistently ranked in the top 7 (\ncurrently ranked 6th\n[https://medium.com/dprating/dprating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-june-2018-who-is-still-coding-in-the-bear-283c89735cbe]\n) of Darpal [https://medium.com/@DPRating]’s monthly reports in 2018, a Github\ncode rating agency, for the entire year of 2018. Particl is consistently ranked\nfirst among privacy coins as well as decentralized marketplaces! CryptoMiso\n[https://cryptomiso.com/], another Github monitoring rating group, currently\nranks Particl in 15th place out of a total of 867 ranked projects within the\nlast 12 months.\n\nWhat if there was a way to visualize Particl’s development history in a more\nuser-friendly way than to manually scan Github stats?\nWith the help of the open-source Github visualizer software Gource\n[http://gource.io/], we produced a series of videos demonstrating the constant\nand impressive work our development team has put into Particl since its\ninception (and the weeks leading up to it).\n\nIn the following videos, you will see visualizations of Particl’s Github\nactivity throughout time. Each moving user you see is a developer that has had\nactivity recorded on one of the displayed repositories. Remember, as we\nconstantly keep our codebase up-to-date with Bitcoin’s, this time-lapse video is\na testament to the cooperation of our 2 teams display. Rather than being in\ncompetition with Bitcoin, Particl is a privacy-focused compliment to Bitcoin,\nand you can see that immediately with both teams represented and developing\nin-step with one another.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGeneral Overview of the Particl Network\nLinks: Particl-Core [http://particl-core], Particl-Desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop] (market\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/tree/market] branch), Particl-Market\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-market], Partyman (cold staking)\n[https://github.com/dasource/partyman], Copay [https://github.com/particl/copay]\n, OMP-Lib [https://github.com/particl/omp-lib], Atomicswap\n[https://github.com/particl/atomicswap], Particl-Bitcore-Lib\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-bitcore-lib], Bitcore-Mnemonic, \nParticl-Bitcoind-RPC [https://github.com/particl/particl-bitcoind-rpc], \nParticl-Bitcore-Message [https://github.com/particl/particl-bitcore-message], \nParticl-Bitcore-Node [https://github.com/particl/particl-bitcore-node], \nBlue-App-BTC [https://github.com/particl/blue-app-btc], Particl-Insight-API\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-insight-api], Particl-Insight-UI\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-insight-ui], Partsuite_Partd\n[https://github.com/particl/partsuite_partd], Partsuite_Partutil\n[https://github.com/particl/partsuite_partutil]\n\nWhat Am I Seeing in This Video?\nTecnovert, Particl’s Lead Core Developer & Cryptographer, making some commits\nThis Particl network overview video regroups all of the major development-based\nrepositories, meaning that non-development repositories such as the particl.io\n[https://github.com/particl/particl.io], branding\n[https://github.com/particl/branding], whitepaper\n[https://github.com/particl/whitepaper], as well as a few others are excluded.\nIt shows Particl developers’ Github activity over time. Each moving user is a\nGithub user that has contributed to one of the listed repositories, and each\n“ray” being shot from these users is a contribution. Furthermore, we have\nhighlighted Particl developers so that their names and pictograms appear in\ngreen whereas Bitcoin Core developers appear as a white/grey name color.\n\nEach “node” represents a folder within one of our repositories and their link to\nother folders are identified by “branches”. Every folder within the same\nrepository is represented under the same “master branch”.\n\nNote: None of these visualizations displays all the work done by the development\nteam. Indeed, each repository is represented by a single Git branch, meaning\nthat work accomplished on other git branches is not reflected in the animation.\nFor example, Particl Desktop’s visualization is set up on the “market” branch,\nwhich is the most up-to-date but doesn’t display the work being done on the \nfeature-multiwallet-v2\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/tree/feature/multiwallet-v2] and \nproposals [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/tree/proposals] branches\n(see active branches here [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/branches]\n).\n\nObservations\nWhat is particularly interesting to notice is just how much the Bitcoin Core\ndevelopers are contributing, indirectly, to the Particl project. In fact,\nbecause we constantly update our codebase to match the latest version of Bitcoin\nCore, we benefit from all the ongoing research and development going on over the\nBitcoin network.\n\nMoreover, keeping our codebase up-to-date not only grants the Particl blockchain\nwith all the security, performance, stability, privacy, and utility enhancements\nmade to the Bitcoin blockchain, but it also enables our development team to fork\nany interesting Bitcoin product and adapt it to work over the Particl network.\n\nParticl Copay, our mobile wallet currently available on Google Play\n[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.particl.copay&hl=en] and for \ndesktops [https://github.com/particl/copay/releases], is a great example and\ndemonstration of this concept. In fact, Copay [https://github.com/bitpay/copay] \nhas initially been developed by Bitpay [https://github.com/bitpay] and was\ndesigned to be a Bitcoin-only mobile wallet. It was, however, forked by the\nParticl development team to give its community an easy-to-use mobile wallet that\ncould also double as a tool to generate and use Particl multi-signature\naddresses, a feature that, to this day, is still only available on Particl\nCopay.\n\nParticl Desktop & Particl Market From Up Close\nWe’ve also isolated three of the repositories shown in the Particl Network\nvisualization and zoomed in to show in greater details the work being\naccomplished. These three repositories are the three main ones in the project\nand are the ones which are being developed the most to accomplish our vision.\n\nParticl Desktop\nParticl Market\nParticl Core in Comparison to Bitcoin Core\nIn the video above, you can compare both Bitcoin’s (left) and Particl’s (right)\ncore codebases. This visualization really highlights the relentless work\naccomplished by our Lead Core Developer & Cryptographer Tecnovert as he adds\nfeatures on top of the Bitcoin codebase at a record speed while constantly\nkeeping Particl’s codebase version in sync with that of Bitcoin’s.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Development-Timeline-Video/1-QqvirCy91HiCO2ToI4Il9Q.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>The Particl project has now been around for around 14 months.

Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\nWill it be possible to cold vote with funds stored on a Ledger Nano S?\nYes. Though the feature is not available at the moment, it will be possible to\nuse the project governance and marketplace governance systems even with coins\nthat have their private keys stored on a Ledger Nano S. This feature will be\npart of our future Ledger integration onto Particl Desktop, but we cannot give\nany kind of ETA for the moment as it is not an immediate focus for any of our\ndevelopment team. We believe those users looking for the highest amount of\nsecurity shouldn’t be penalized and taken out of the democratic process of the\nParticl community.\n\nWill Particl be added on Coinbase?\nImran, our Commercial & Partner Strategy Director, is always on the lookout for\nnew exchanges as well as regularly keeping in touch with the more popular ones.\nThere is a lot of back and forth going on at any moment with many exchanges and\nare positive that the interest for the Particl project is growing within the\n“exchange community” as we ourselves are slowly nearing the release of the\nmarketplace (which would be our biggest milestone to date) and putting our money\nwhere our mouth is in terms of development. We cannot and will never, however,\ntell anyone in advance of a listing agreement before we officially and publicly\nannounce it.\n\nWe have currently adjusted our strategy to mostly focus on the larger and more\nprofessional exchanges, those we believe are in it for the long run and have a\nsolid legal foundation. We, of course, welcome smaller or new exchanges to list\nus, and we have no problem providing development support to those, but we might\nnot go ahead and pay the listing fees anymore.\n\nAs for Coinbase more specifically, we know they have started adding new coins\nand will work on seizing that opportunity!\n\nWill private listings be able to be governed by the community?\nBoth public and private listings will be governable by the community\nexclusively, however, as private listings do not appear on the public interface\nof the marketplace, they are expected to be much more unlikely to be voted out\nby the community unless it leaks to the public or creates a controversy.\n\nThat is because listings need to reach a certain user flagging threshold to be\ntaken out of the marketplace, and since private listings are hidden to the\nentire public except for those in possession of its unique key or link, this\nthreshold should be much harder to reach.\n\nThis will ensure users can still transact privately between each other and do so\naway from the public eye, but should the transacted content be highly\ninappropriate and leaked out, the community will still possess the ability to\nclean its marketplace from it.\n\nAs for one on one private deals where the private keys never leak to any other\nparty other than the ones involved, they simply won’t be possible to moderate\nout as the flagging threshold for the deletion of listings will be set too high\nfor any or both parties to singlehandedly have enough governing influence over\nit.\n\nWhen I do a search on Google for decentralized marketplaces, other projects show\nup on the first page, but not Particl. Why is that and what are the team’s\nthoughts about this?\nWe believe there are many reasons for it. For one, we are a very young project,\nat least compared to some of the decentralized marketplace projects out there,\nhaving only been “live” on mainnet since the 17th of July 2017. It also could be\ndue to our relatively smaller community size. In fact, having a smaller\ncommunity, and especially one that resides mostly on instant messaging platforms\nsuch as Discord or Telegram, generates fewer discussions about the project on\nthe web, which in turn makes us harder for the search engine algorithms to pick\nup.\n\nIt’s also important not to forget that Particl is not merely a decentralized\nmarketplace, but a full-blown privacy-focused decentralized application\nplatform. This means that our community discussions are not only focused on the\ndecentralized marketplace aspect of the project but also stretch into our many\nother perks and related topics such as cold staking, dApps, RingCT, privacy,\nsecurity, and etc. This is in contrast with other “competitors” (quotes have\nbeen added as we strongly believe we are carving our very own niche category of\nblockchains) that focus exclusively on decentralized eCommerce. The fact we are\nbuilding Particl to be much more than a marketplace, we believe, is one of our\nstrongest quality and while it may result in less focused and more diversified\ndiscussions, it will ultimately allow us to reach out to a more a diverse set of\nusers.\n\nFollowing a similar train of thought, we are also very cautious about not\nheavily promoting aspects of the project that is still in deep stages of\ndevelopment as delays and unforeseen issues can always arise, especially when\nbuilding a platform as complex as Particl is.\n\nWhile this is most probably about to change as we near the completion of the\nfirst mainnet version of Particl Marketplace, the above reasons might have\ncontributed in part to Particl being harder to find when referencing\ndecentralized marketplace discussions. Getting better search results will\nrequire time, more updates, users, and web-based discussions. The latter, for\nexample, is expected to dramatically improve as we are just about to release our\nforum. We, in fact, believe that it will help carry some of the great\ndiscussions going on over on the instant messaging platforms to an indexable and\nweb-based platform. Please see the dedicated forum section of this update\nfurther down the page.\n\nA while ago, there was a Twitter poll about stable coins. Wouldn’t integrating\nany of these hinder user’s privacy and usability by requiring KYC/AML\nidentifications? Wouldn’t that defeat the entire purpose of the Particl project?\nIt is true that some stable coins (or any potential third-party integration)\nrequire KYC/AML identification of users on their end to be utilized to their\nfull potential, however, it is not going to be something that is required for\nthe Particl platform to provide any of its critical features.\n\nFor clarification purposes, this poll was meant as a fun way for us to get to\nknow our community better. Stable coins, like the poll’s winner Digix, possess\nthe interesting ability to maintain some kind of stable valuation (i.e. 1 DGX =\n1g of physical gold, 1 USDt = ~1 USD, and etc). This can be super useful for\npeople wishing to opt out of the fiat system, but also avoid the volatility\nusually associated with the cryptocurrency market.\n\nRest assured, any non-PART Particl Marketplace transaction still needs to, and\nwill always need to, be settled in PART as it requires the coin’s RingCT\ncapabilities to protect users’ privacy and also because the marketplace’s MAD\nescrow system is based on a Particl smart-contract that can only work using PART\ncoins similarly to how Ether is the fuel for Ethereum-based smart-contracts and\nis required for them to execute.\n\nStable coins, in the case of Particl, are very interesting because they allow\nusers to get the best of both the fiat and crypto world: an arguably stable\nmeans to store value that can be readily be spent on anything available on the\nParticl Marketplace. In that sense, both the marketplace and stable coins give\neach other a great use-case that comes very close to an eCommerce experience\nregular people are used to dealing with.\n\nNote that it is possible for third-party integrations to require KYC/AML\nidentifications, but that will always we offered as an option and will never be\nmandatory as that would directly go against our mission and what we stand for.\n\nIs the team aware of the Nothing-At-Stake attack on PoS consensus algorithms and\nif so, how does it intend to fix this vulnerability?\nYes, the team is very aware of this often-promoted-by-PoW-advocates\nvulnerability of the Proof-of-Stake algorithm and has implemented checkpoints to\nmitigate this issue. We recommend joining the Open Development channel on\nDiscord and chat with our developer Kewde to get more in-depth insights about\nhow we have designed the Particl blockchain to be protected against this attack\nprecisely.\n\nIs the RingCT protocol ready for mainnet or does it still requires some tweaks\nas indicated by either the NJIT Department of Technology academic report or\nWSA’s security audit?\nYes, both the academic report and security audit have indicated that no issue\nwas found with our Bitcoin-based implementation of the RingCT protocol. As many\nof you already know, this implementation has been on testnet ever since we\nlaunched Particl on the 17th of July 2017 and thus is virtually ready for\nmainnet implementation.\n\nNote that, as the RingCT hardfork will be combined (subject to change) with the\nmarketplace governance one, it will have to wait until the latter is ready for\nmainnet implementation. It will be announced several weeks in advance for users\nto be aware of it coming.\n\nIs RingCT on marketplace transactions a requirement for Particl Marketplace\nmainnet?\nMost likely. RingCT is tentatively planned on being hardforked at the same time\nas the marketplace governance system which is an absolute requirement for the\nmarketplace to be released on mainnet. We have started to look into\nBulletproofs, which is the RingCT/CT protocol improvement that should reduce\nprivacy transaction sizes by about 80%, and might even add it to the hardfork.\n\nThe first step to enhancing our escrow system is to put CT on it, then shifting\nto RingCT should be pretty easy. Ultimately, the only absolute requirement for\nthe marketplace is the governance system, and it would be unlikely that it would\nrelease without RingCT escrow as well, instead putting CT on the marketplace for\na while, but this is not out of the question neither. We will keep you updated\nabout this as we know more.\n\nWhat is MOIN? Why are they looking into forking the Particl codebase and what\nimpact would that carry for the Particl project?\nMOIN is a small hobby project which is not associated in any way with the\nParticl team but their lead developer is on good terms with our Lead Graphic &\nBranding Designer CRZ. MOIN was started as a Shadowcash fork and just like we\ndid in the past, probably realize how outdated this codebase is getting.\n\nWhile we haven’t really received any information from them as of late, we did\nsuggest to them that they increase their supply when hardforking and airdrop it\nto Particl holders as a token of appreciation and to cross-pollinate both\ncommunities.\n\nWhat makes Particl better than its competition?\nParticl has a lot of things going for it. One very important aspect is the fact\nthat we have a coin which a community can rally behind. This is missing from\nOpenBazaar, which we believe they might start seeing the use of having one as\nthey are planning on integrating some kind of token to their decentralized\nmarketplace.\n\nBut the most important factors which makes us much different than any of our\ncompetitors is our focus on both security, privacy, and true decentralization\nwithout compromise. In fact, in the case of Syscoin’s Blockmarket marketplace,\nit is moderated by the Syscoin staff itself and in the case of OpenBazaar, they\nemploy moderators. Both of these competitors also make use of a centralized form\nof escrow which not only makes the platforms less scalable (more people need to\nbe hired or moderating as the more users start using these platforms), but it\nalso leaves the door wide open for collusion between a staff member or escrow\nagent and one of the parties involved.\n\nWhile it may seem unlikely that a third-party would collude with another party,\nit is actually more common than it seems. It is also possible for a third-party\nto make a wrong or bad decision when the participants of a marketplace\ntransaction that’s been put in “conflict” cannot agree on any resolution or if\none of them is lying to the escrow agent. There are countless examples where\nmoderated deals can go bad, and we’d rather put 100% of the responsibility to\nthe participating users themselves rather than a moderating party.\n\nFor a more detailed breakdown of Particl’s advantages over its competitors, you\ncan refer back to a Reddit post made by Cryptoguard here: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/8k3kv2/what_are_the_competitive_advantages_of_particl/dz559jr\n\nAre there any plans on sending more Particl team members to more conferences\nand meetups?\nAbsolutely! When we went to this year’s edition of the Consensus Conference, we\nnoticed that we were one of the only projects with an actual product to show\nfor, even though only on its Alpha version. This, in turn, attracted a lot of\nattention from the conference’s participants and we also were quite impressed by\nthe number of people that actually knew about what we were building. This tells\nus that we need to have an increased presence in conferences as the sentiment we\nreceived from our short time in Consensus was quite positive.\n\nOur budget is, however, quite limited for now as we are in a deep development\nphase and more focused on hiring developers to release our product than hyping\n“vaporware”. Sending team members and representatives to conferences,\ncrypto-themed, and others will definitely be part of our budget once we go\nthrough our Primary Funding Round where we aim to raise much more capital than\nwe did during the coin swap.\n\nWe would, nonetheless, support any community member desiring to present Particl\nin meetups or conferences. If you plan on attending or speaking to one such\nevent, let us know and we will assist you with material and look into what you\nwould need to make the presentation more impactful. Don’t hesitate to contact\nPaul Schmitzer, our Communications Manager, or Cryptoguard, our Community\nManager, if you are interested.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nLedger Staking Tutorial is Now Available!\nWe announced on the 7th of August that Particl was finally able to be managed\nfrom Ledger Nano S hardware devices, with cold staking enabled. However, at the\ntime of the announcement, no tutorial on how to enable hardware cold staking was\navailable. This changed on the 17th of August when we officially published a\nproper tutorial on how to activate cold staking on these devices, making Particl\nthe world’s safest Proof-of-Stake protocol. To enable your Ledger Nano S\nhardware device for cold staking, simply follow the steps included in this\ntutorial: https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking\n\nNote: While this tutorial is pretty straight-forward, it may be reserved for the\nmore advanced users. If you do not want to mess with the debug window or some of\nthe more advanced features of the Particl blockchain, it is recommended that you\nwait for the Particl Desktop integration which will come at a later time.\n\nNew Particl Desktop Developer’s First Commit\nAs mentioned a few times already, we hired a new developer in July to lead and\noversee the development of our Particl Desktop client (as well as potentially\nworking on Particl Copay), the centerpiece of the Particl platform, starting on\nAugust 1st, 2018. He has now started reviewing our entire Particl Desktop code\nand has even pushed his first commit\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1113], a rather large one, on\nGithub which shows great professionalism. In fact, zaSmilingIdiot\n[https://github.com/zaSmilingIdiot] has a lot of experience working with large\nteams of developers and his work methodology will surely be a great asset to our\nproject and its development pace. Consult his first PR by following this link: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1113\n\nIt is worth noting that, whenever you log into Github and consult pull requests,\nGithub will indicate you, upon consulting at a later time, of the new changes\nand updates made to the pull request since the last time you looked at it. This\ncan be quite useful when tracking the development progress of the project.\n\nPull Request Updates IndicatorNew Status Report Published Includes New Exciting\nDevelopments\nSpeaking of development, we’ve published on the 20th of August a new Status\nReport showing the project’s progress. While it contains similar items as our\nlast Status Report, several of them have been moved to the “Waiting for Review”\ncategory, meaning they’ve been completed and are undergoing the final testing\nphase. These items include Particl Desktop 1.2.2 (which is already available to\nanyone as a stable mainnet pre-release\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2]) and the\nlong-awaited marketplace governance system (version 1.0). If all the testing\ngoes well, we should see the governance mechanism appear in some form or the\nother on Particl Marketplace Alpha (can be downloaded here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2]) in the coming\nweeks.\n\nStaking Pools Incoming!\nOne of the biggest takeaway one can get from our latest Status Report is the\ninclusion of staking pool related features in the “In Development” category.\nThis is directly in relation to our commitment to offer secure but accessible\noptions to ALL of our users and will also potentially strengthen the Particl\nnetwork by incentivizing even more users to run their own node. In fact,\nTecnovert, our Core Lead Developer, has started working on a cold staking pool\nproof-of-concept that would allow any user to stake their funds and receive\nconstant rewards regardless of the amount they hold. As it currently stands,\nanyone, big or small holder, can put up their funds for staking, but those with\nsmaller balances may find the process impractical as staking rewards are paid in\n~1.24 PART increments. A user holding only 50 PART, for example, would need to\nwait several months in between staking rewards.\n\nWith a staking pool, anyone can dedicate their staking powers to a staking pool\nwhich has the ability to send out staking reward payments in smaller increments,\nsimilarly to how proof-of-work mining pools allow multiple users to pool up\ntheir hashing powers to receive smaller but more numerous payments.\n\nMore details about this feature will be given at a later time.\n\nMarketplace and Project Governance are About to Hit Testnet!\nOur governance mechanisms have seen a lot of progress being made to them in the\nlast few weeks, and are now imminently reaching a point where they will start\nbeing integrated onto our testnet network for community testing. This will mark\na very important milestone in the development of the Particl project, and can be\ntentatively expected for the new few weeks.\n\nWe hope to get as many testers as possible as the more people test these\nfeatures, the more effectively we can identify bugs, improvements to be made,\nand such, which in turns can result in these features hitting mainnet more\nquickly. These are exciting times for the project and the pieces are starting to\nfall into place!\n\nA New Video Showing the Impressive Amount of Work Put Into Particl Since its\nInception\nToday we want to give you guys a sneak peek of a blog post that will likely come\nout next week. Using an open-source Github activity analysis tool, we were able\nto produce a mindblowing video highlighting the mindblowing amount of work that\nour development team has put into Particl since its inception.\n\nIn this video, the users moving around are blockchain developers. Those with\ntheir names written in green are Particl developers, and those with their names\nwritten in grey are Bitcoin developers. It highlights several of our development\nrepositories (meaning repos like Particl.io, Branding, Whitepaper, and such are\nexcluded), including Particl Core, Particl Desktop, Particl Market, OMP-Lib, and\nother repos instrumental to the development of the project.\n\nIt is particularly interesting to not only see how relentless our developers are\nregardless of the overall cryptocurrency market situation but also how keeping\nour codebase up-to-date with the latest Bitcoin Core version positively impacts\nthe project. In fact, while Bitcoin Core developers do not work on Particl Core\nat all, their work on the Bitcoin codebase is still reflected on ours, granting\nus all the latest performance, stability, security, and usability developments\nmade over Bitcoin Core. More videos, including isolated repositories such as\nParticl Desktop, will be posted in a coming dedicated blog post. Stay tuned!\n\nThe PIVX-Particl Alliance Voting Round is an Overwhelming Success!\nWe announced not too long ago that we had struck an agreement with the PIVX\ncommunity to set up a vote for an alliance where they would get listed to the\nParticl Marketplace (as with every other coins, non-PART Particl Marketplace\ntransactions still need to be ultimately settled in PART) and we would get\nlisted on zDEX. Then, both marketing/social media teams would collaborate\ntogether for some cross-promotion, promoting privacy, security, and\ndecentralization (more details here: \nhttps://forum.pivx.org/t/particl-application-for-pivx-alliance/4379).\n\nThe voting round has been initiated on PIVX’s end, and it is safe to say that\nthe proposal has been an overwhelming success! In fact, as it currently stands,\nthe votes are 330 in favor of the alliance, and 4 are against it. We are very\nhappy to see the PIVX community interested in joining forces with us and\ncooperate with a fellow privacy and decentralization-minded project! We take it\nas a huge stepping stone for cooperation between the two projects and maybe the\nstart of something bigger, as in more cooperation campaigns between the two\nprojects. As with everything-PIVX though, any further proposal will be required\nto be voted on by their community, but we are confident we may start seeing more\njoint proposals appearing in the future.\n\nTo track the proposal and its voting results, please follow this link: \nhttp://178.254.23.111/~pub/DN/DN_Info.html\n\nDownload and Use Particl Desktop 1.2.2 Before it is Released!\nRecently, most of the Particl Desktop development has been focused on the\nmarketplace, but its wallet functions have also undergone quite a few major\nchanges (and we fully expect the pace to pick up even more with our new Particl\nDesktop lead developer zaSmilingIdiot). In fact, you can download Particl\nDesktop 1.2.2 [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2] \ntoday in its pre-release but stable version. This new Particl Desktop version is\na major update on the mainnet wallet capabilities of Particl’s main client. A\nmajority of its user interface has been improved upon as well as made more\nuser-friendly and a lot of bugs and fixes were implemented to make the Particl\nDesktop experience as smooth as it has ever been!\n\nMore Updates Being Made to the Website\nOur official website, particl.io, is currently undergoing major changes and\nupdates. Indeed, Martin Allien, our UI/UX Front-End Developer, is currently\nrevamping most of its text in order to make it accessible and approachable to a\nwider audience as well as adding new information pages. One such page is Coin\nSpecifications [https://particl.io/coin-specifications/], a page entirely\ndedicated to giving a quick and to-the-point overview of the technical aspects\nof the Particl coin and blockchain.\n\nTo see all the latest changes made to the website, you can follow its commits on\nGithub here: https://github.com/particl/particl.io/commits/master\n\nForum Update\nAlmost everything is ready to be released, but we are still resolving the final\nemail issue which renders forum registration difficult. In most cases,\nconfirmation emails (any email sent from the forum, for that matter) will either\nnot reach the user’s inbox or directly land in the spam folder, a behavior which\nisn’t up to speed with what we want to offer our community.\n\nIf you wish, however, to test it out before it is revealed and give us some\nfeedback, do not hesitate to contact Cryptoguard on either Telegram or Discord\nand he will send you the link as well as instructions on how to receive the\nregistration email.\n\nBitcoinTalk Opening Post Being Revamped\nAt the same time as we are going over some of the aspects of our website, we are\nalso working on refreshing our BitcoinTalk opening post as it is now severely\noutdated. Speaking of BitcoinTalk, we do believe that it needs to be more\nactive. In fact, every time a comment is posted in it, it bumps the thread to\nthe top of the list, thus giving us more exposure, if only for a brief moment.\nWe are looking into some ways to make it more active, including linking the\nthread to a Discord room or to a Particl forum megathread. Linking the BCT\nthread to some other medium is not an immediate priority but will be something\nwe will start looking into more seriously after we officially release the forum.\n\nParticl is on Mastodon\nDid you know of Mastodon? It is an open-source and decentralized social media\nplatform on which we have an account registered on. Make sure to give us a\nfollow for yet another way to keep yourself up-to-date with all the latest news\nsurrounding the project by following the link here: \nhttps://mastodon.social/@particl\n\nWhat is Satoshi Citadel Industries?\nWe posted yesterday an interview with Miguel Cunetta, one of our key advisor,\nwhere he explains what is Satoshi Citadel Industries.

Though the feature is not available at the moment, it will be possible to use the project governance and marketplace governance systems even with coins that have their private keys stored on a Ledger Nano S. This feature will be part of our future Ledger integration onto Particl Desktop, but we cannot give any kind of ETA for the moment as it is not an immediate focus for any of our development team. We believe those users looking for the highest amount of security shouldn’t be penalized and taken out of the democratic process of the Particl community.</p><h3 id=\"will-particl-be-added-on-coinbase\">Will Particl be added on Coinbase?</h3><p>Imran, our Commercial &amp; Partner Strategy Director, is always on the lookout for new exchanges as well as regularly keeping in touch with the more popular ones. There is a lot of back and forth going on at any moment with many exchanges and are positive that the interest for the Particl project is growing within the “exchange community” as we ourselves are slowly nearing the release of the marketplace (which would be our biggest milestone to date) and putting our money where our mouth is in terms of development. We cannot and will never, however, tell anyone in advance of a listing agreement before we officially and publicly announce it.</p><p>We have currently adjusted our strategy to mostly focus on the larger and more professional exchanges, those we believe are in it for the long run and have a solid legal foundation. We, of course, welcome smaller or new exchanges to list us, and we have no problem providing development support to those, but we might not go ahead and pay the listing fees anymore.</p><p>As for Coinbase more specifically, we know they have started adding new coins and will work on seizing that opportunity!</p><h3 id=\"will-private-listings-be-able-to-be-governed-by-the-community\">Will private listings be able to be governed by the community?</h3><p>Both public and private listings will be governable by the community exclusively, however, as private listings do not appear on the public interface of the marketplace, they are expected to be much more unlikely to be voted out by the community unless it leaks to the public or creates a controversy.</p><p>That is because listings need to reach a certain user flagging threshold to be taken out of the marketplace, and since private listings are hidden to the entire public except for those in possession of its unique key or link, this threshold should be much harder to reach.</p><p>This will ensure users can still transact privately between each other and do so away from the public eye, but should the transacted content be highly inappropriate and leaked out, the community will still possess the ability to clean its marketplace from it.</p><p>As for one on one private deals where the private keys never leak to any other party other than the ones involved, they simply won’t be possible to moderate out as the flagging threshold for the deletion of listings will be set too high for any or both parties to singlehandedly have enough governing influence over it.</p><h3 id=\"when-i-do-a-search-on-google-for-decentralized-marketplaces-other-projects-show-up-on-the-first-page-but-not-particl-why-is-that-and-what-are-the-team-s-thoughts-about-this\">When I do a search on Google for decentralized marketplaces, other projects show up on the first page, but not Particl. Why is that and what are the team’s thoughts about this?</h3><p>We believe there are many reasons for it. For one, we are a very young project, at least compared to some of the decentralized marketplace projects out there, having only been “live” on mainnet since the 17th of July 2017. It also could be due to our relatively smaller community size. In fact, having a smaller community, and especially one that resides mostly on instant messaging platforms such as Discord or Telegram, generates fewer discussions about the project on the web, which in turn makes us harder for the search engine algorithms to pick up.</p><p>It’s also important not to forget that Particl is not merely a decentralized marketplace, but a full-blown privacy-focused decentralized application platform. This means that our community discussions are not only focused on the decentralized marketplace aspect of the project but also stretch into our many other perks and related topics such as cold staking, dApps, RingCT, privacy, security, and etc. This is in contrast with other “competitors” (quotes have been added as we strongly believe we are carving our very own niche category of blockchains) that focus exclusively on decentralized eCommerce. The fact we are building Particl to be much more than a marketplace, we believe, is one of our strongest quality and while it may result in less focused and more diversified discussions, it will ultimately allow us to reach out to a more a diverse set of users.</p><p>Following a similar train of thought, we are also very cautious about not heavily promoting aspects of the project that is still in deep stages of development as delays and unforeseen issues can always arise, especially when building a platform as complex as Particl is.</p><p>While this is most probably about to change as we near the completion of the first mainnet version of Particl Marketplace, the above reasons might have contributed in part to Particl being harder to find when referencing decentralized marketplace discussions. Getting better search results will require time, more updates, users, and web-based discussions. The latter, for example, is expected to dramatically improve as we are just about to release our forum. We, in fact, believe that it will help carry some of the great discussions going on over on the instant messaging platforms to an indexable and web-based platform. <strong>Please see the dedicated forum section of this update further down the page.</strong></p><h3 id=\"a-while-ago-there-was-a-twitter-poll-about-stable-coins-wouldn-t-integrating-any-of-these-hinder-user-s-privacy-and-usability-by-requiring-kyc-aml-identifications-wouldn-t-that-defeat-the-entire-purpose-of-the-particl-project\">A while ago, there was a Twitter poll about stable coins. Wouldn’t integrating any of these hinder user’s privacy and usability by requiring KYC/AML identifications? Wouldn’t that defeat the entire purpose of the Particl project?</h3><p>It is true that some stable coins (or any potential third-party integration) require KYC/AML identification of users <strong>on their end </strong>to be utilized to their full potential, however, it is not going to be something that is required for the Particl platform to provide any of its critical features.</p><p>For clarification purposes, this poll was meant as a fun way for us to get to know our community better. Stable coins, like the poll’s winner Digix, possess the interesting ability to maintain some kind of stable valuation (i.e. 1 DGX = 1g of physical gold, 1 USDt = ~1 USD, and etc). This can be super useful for people wishing to opt out of the fiat system, but also avoid the volatility usually associated with the cryptocurrency market.</p><p>Rest assured, any non-PART Particl Marketplace transaction still needs to, and will always need to, be settled in PART as it requires the coin’s RingCT capabilities to protect users’ privacy and also because the marketplace’s MAD escrow system is based on a Particl smart-contract that can only work using PART coins similarly to how Ether is the fuel for Ethereum-based smart-contracts and is required for them to execute.</p><p>Stable coins, in the case of Particl, are very interesting because they allow users to get the best of both the fiat and crypto world: an arguably stable means to store value that can be readily be spent on anything available on the Particl Marketplace. In that sense, both the marketplace and stable coins give each other a great use-case that comes very close to an eCommerce experience regular people are used to dealing with.</p><p>Note that it is possible for third-party integrations to require KYC/AML identifications, but that will <strong>always</strong> we offered as an option and will <strong>never </strong>be mandatory as that would directly go against our mission and what we stand for.</p><h3 id=\"is-the-team-aware-of-the-nothing-at-stake-attack-on-pos-consensus-algorithms-and-if-so-how-does-it-intend-to-fix-this-vulnerability\">Is the team aware of the Nothing-At-Stake attack on PoS consensus algorithms and if so, how does it intend to fix this vulnerability?</h3><p>Yes, the team is very aware of this often-promoted-by-PoW-advocates vulnerability of the Proof-of-Stake algorithm and has implemented checkpoints to mitigate this issue. We recommend joining the Open Development channel on Discord and chat with our developer Kewde to get more in-depth insights about how we have designed the Particl blockchain to be protected against this attack precisely.</p><h3 id=\"is-the-ringct-protocol-ready-for-mainnet-or-does-it-still-requires-some-tweaks-as-indicated-by-either-the-njit-department-of-technology-academic-report-or-wsa-s-security-audit\">Is the RingCT protocol ready for mainnet or does it still requires some tweaks as indicated by either the NJIT Department of Technology academic report or WSA’s security audit?</h3><p>Yes, both the academic report and security audit have indicated that no issue was found with our Bitcoin-based implementation of the RingCT protocol. As many of you already know, this implementation has been on testnet ever since we launched Particl on the 17th of July 2017 and thus is virtually ready for mainnet implementation.</p><p>Note that, as the RingCT hardfork will be combined (subject to change) with the marketplace governance one, it will have to wait until the latter is ready for mainnet implementation. It will be announced several weeks in advance for users to be aware of it coming.</p><h3 id=\"is-ringct-on-marketplace-transactions-a-requirement-for-particl-marketplace-mainnet\">Is RingCT on marketplace transactions a requirement for Particl Marketplace mainnet?</h3><p>Most likely. RingCT is tentatively planned on being hardforked at the same time as the marketplace governance system which is an absolute requirement for the marketplace to be released on mainnet. We have started to look into Bulletproofs, which is the RingCT/CT protocol improvement that should reduce privacy transaction sizes by about 80%, and might even add it to the hardfork.</p><p>The first step to enhancing our escrow system is to put CT on it, then shifting to RingCT should be pretty easy. Ultimately, the only absolute requirement for the marketplace is the governance system, and it would be unlikely that it would release without RingCT escrow as well, instead putting CT on the marketplace for a while, but this is not out of the question neither. We will keep you updated about this as we know more.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-moin-why-are-they-looking-into-forking-the-particl-codebase-and-what-impact-would-that-carry-for-the-particl-project\">What is MOIN? Why are they looking into forking the Particl codebase and what impact would that carry for the Particl project?</h3><p>MOIN is a small hobby project which is not associated in any way with the Particl team but their lead developer is on good terms with our Lead Graphic &amp; Branding Designer CRZ. MOIN was started as a Shadowcash fork and just like we did in the past, probably realize how outdated this codebase is getting.</p><p>While we haven’t really received any information from them as of late, we did suggest to them that they increase their supply when hardforking and airdrop it to Particl holders as a token of appreciation and to cross-pollinate both communities.</p><h3 id=\"what-makes-particl-better-than-its-competition\">What makes Particl better than its competition?</h3><p>Particl has a lot of things going for it. One very important aspect is the fact that we have a coin which a community can rally behind. This is missing from OpenBazaar, which we believe they might start seeing the use of having one as they are planning on integrating some kind of token to their decentralized marketplace.</p><p>But the most important factors which makes us much different than <strong>any </strong>of our competitors is our focus on both security, privacy, and true decentralization without compromise. In fact, in the case of Syscoin’s Blockmarket marketplace, it is moderated by the Syscoin staff itself and in the case of OpenBazaar, they employ moderators. Both of these competitors also make use of a centralized form of escrow which not only makes the platforms less scalable (more people need to be hired or moderating as the more users start using these platforms), but it also leaves the door wide open for collusion between a staff member or escrow agent and one of the parties involved.</p><p>While it may seem unlikely that a third-party would collude with another party, it is actually more common than it seems. It is also possible for a third-party to make a wrong or bad decision when the participants of a marketplace transaction that’s been put in “conflict” cannot agree on any resolution or if one of them is lying to the escrow agent. There are countless examples where moderated deals can go bad, and we’d rather put 100% of the responsibility to the participating users themselves rather than a moderating party.</p><p>For a more detailed breakdown of Particl’s advantages over its competitors, you can refer back to a Reddit post made by Cryptoguard here: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/8k3kv2/what_are_the_competitive_advantages_of_particl/dz559jr\">https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/8k3kv2/what_are_the_competitive_advantages_of_particl/dz559jr</a></p><h3 id=\"are-there-any-plans-on-sending-more-particl-team-members-to-more-conferences-and-meetups\">Are there any plans on sending more Particl team members to more conferences and meetups?</h3><p>Absolutely! When we went to this year’s edition of the Consensus Conference, we noticed that we were one of the only projects with an actual product to show for, even though only on its Alpha version. This, in turn, attracted a lot of attention from the conference’s participants and we also were quite impressed by the number of people that actually knew about what we were building. This tells us that we need to have an increased presence in conferences as the sentiment we received from our short time in Consensus was quite positive.</p><p>Our budget is, however, quite limited for now as we are in a deep development phase and more focused on hiring developers to release our product than hyping “vaporware”. Sending team members and representatives to conferences, crypto-themed, and others will definitely be part of our budget once we go through our Primary Funding Round where we aim to raise much more capital than we did during the coin swap.</p><p>We would, nonetheless, support any community member desiring to present Particl in meetups or conferences. If you plan on attending or speaking to one such event, let us know and we will assist you with material and look into what you would need to make the presentation more impactful. Don’t hesitate to contact Paul Schmitzer, our Communications Manager, or Cryptoguard, our Community Manager, if you are interested.</p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &amp; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"ledger-staking-tutorial-is-now-available-\">Ledger Staking Tutorial is Now Available!</h3><p>We announced on the 7th of August that Particl was finally able to be managed from Ledger Nano S hardware devices, with cold staking enabled. However, at the time of the announcement, no tutorial on how to enable hardware cold staking was available. This changed on the 17th of August when we officially published a proper tutorial on how to activate cold staking on these devices, <strong>making Particl the world’s safest Proof-of-Stake protocol</strong>. To enable your Ledger Nano S hardware device for cold staking, simply follow the steps included in this tutorial: <a href=\"https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking\">https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking</a></p><p><em><strong>Note: </strong></em><em>While this tutorial is pretty straight-forward, it may be reserved for the more advanced users. If you do not want to mess with the debug window or some of the more advanced features of the Particl blockchain, it is recommended that you wait for the Particl Desktop integration which will come at a later time.</em></p><h3 id=\"new-particl-desktop-developer-s-first-commit\">New Particl Desktop Developer’s First Commit</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--5/1-pPTQ44Cy-aSYxa4DOKe8yw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>As mentioned a few times already, we hired a new developer in July to lead and oversee the development of our Particl Desktop client (as well as potentially working on Particl Copay), the centerpiece of the Particl platform, starting on August 1st, 2018. He has now started reviewing our entire Particl Desktop code and <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1113\">has even pushed his first commit</a>, a rather large one, on Github which shows great professionalism. In fact, <a href=\"https://github.com/zaSmilingIdiot\">zaSmilingIdiot</a> has a lot of experience working with large teams of developers and his work methodology will surely be a great asset to our project and its development pace. Consult his first PR by following this link: <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1113\">https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1113</a></p><p>It is worth noting that, whenever you log into Github and consult pull requests, Github will indicate you, upon consulting at a later time, of the new changes and updates made to the pull request since the last time you looked at it. This can be quite useful when tracking the development progress of the project.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--5/1-tL7afRrDjl94gy4OKkl6nQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Pull Request Updates Indicator</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"new-status-report-published-includes-new-exciting-developments\">New Status Report Published Includes New Exciting Developments</h3><p>Speaking of development, we’ve published on the 20th of August a new Status Report showing the project’s progress. While it contains similar items as our last Status Report, several of them have been moved to the “Waiting for Review” category, meaning they’ve been completed and are undergoing the final testing phase. These items include Particl Desktop 1.2.2 (<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2\">which is already available to anyone as a stable mainnet pre-release</a>) <strong>and the long-awaited marketplace governance system (version 1.0)</strong>. If all the testing goes well, we should see the governance mechanism appear in some form or the other on Particl Marketplace Alpha (<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2\">can be downloaded here</a>) in the coming weeks.</p><h3 id=\"staking-pools-incoming-\">Staking Pools Incoming!</h3><p>One of the biggest takeaway one can get from our latest Status Report is the inclusion of staking pool related features in the “In Development” category. This is directly in relation to our commitment to offer secure but accessible options to ALL of our users and will also potentially strengthen the Particl network by incentivizing even more users to run their own node. In fact, Tecnovert, our Core Lead Developer, has started working on a cold staking pool proof-of-concept that would allow any user to stake their funds and receive constant rewards regardless of the amount they hold. As it currently stands, anyone, big or small holder, can put up their funds for staking, but those with smaller balances may find the process impractical as staking rewards are paid in ~1.24 PART increments. A user holding only 50 PART, for example, would need to wait several months in between staking rewards.</p><p>With a staking pool, anyone can dedicate their staking powers to a staking pool which has the ability to send out staking reward payments in smaller increments, similarly to how proof-of-work mining pools allow multiple users to pool up their hashing powers to receive smaller but more numerous payments.</p><p>More details about this feature will be given at a later time.</p><h3 id=\"marketplace-and-project-governance-are-about-to-hit-testnet-\">Marketplace and Project Governance are About to Hit Testnet!</h3><p>Our governance mechanisms have seen a lot of progress being made to them in the last few weeks, and are now imminently reaching a point where they will start being integrated onto our testnet network for community testing. This will mark a very important milestone in the development of the Particl project, and can be tentatively expected for the new few weeks.</p><p>We hope to get as many testers as possible as the more people test these features, the more effectively we can identify bugs, improvements to be made, and such, which in turns can result in these features hitting mainnet more quickly. These are exciting times for the project and the pieces are starting to fall into place!</p><h3 id=\"a-new-video-showing-the-impressive-amount-of-work-put-into-particl-since-its-inception\">A New Video Showing the Impressive Amount of Work Put Into Particl Since its Inception</h3><p>Today we want to give you guys a sneak peek of a blog post that will likely come out next week. Using an open-source Github activity analysis tool, we were able to produce a mindblowing video highlighting the mindblowing amount of work that our development team has put into Particl since its inception.</p><p>In this video, the users moving around are blockchain developers. Those with their names written in green are Particl developers, and those with their names written in grey are Bitcoin developers. It highlights several of our development repositories (meaning repos like Particl.io, Branding, Whitepaper, and such are excluded), including Particl Core, Particl Desktop, Particl Market, OMP-Lib, and other repos instrumental to the development of the project.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iaaEG15n7zY?feature=oembed\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>It is particularly interesting to not only see how relentless our developers are regardless of the overall cryptocurrency market situation but also how keeping our codebase up-to-date with the latest Bitcoin Core version positively impacts the project. In fact, while Bitcoin Core developers do not work on Particl Core at all, their work on the Bitcoin codebase is still reflected on ours, granting us all the latest performance, stability, security, and usability developments made over Bitcoin Core. More videos, including isolated repositories such as Particl Desktop, will be posted in a coming dedicated blog post. Stay tuned!</p><h3 id=\"the-pivx-particl-alliance-voting-round-is-an-overwhelming-success-\">The PIVX-Particl Alliance Voting Round is an Overwhelming Success!</h3><p>We announced not too long ago that we had struck an agreement with the PIVX community to set up a vote for an alliance where they would get listed to the Particl Marketplace (as with every other coins, non-PART Particl Marketplace transactions still need to be ultimately settled in PART) and we would get listed on zDEX. Then, both marketing/social media teams would collaborate together for some cross-promotion, promoting privacy, security, and decentralization (more details here: <a href=\"https://forum.pivx.org/t/particl-application-for-pivx-alliance/4379\">https://forum.pivx.org/t/particl-application-for-pivx-alliance/4379</a>).</p><p>The voting round has been initiated on PIVX’s end, and it is safe to say that the proposal has been an overwhelming success! In fact, as it currently stands, the votes are 330 in favor of the alliance, and 4 are against it. We are very happy to see the PIVX community interested in joining forces with us and cooperate with a fellow privacy and decentralization-minded project! We take it as a huge stepping stone for cooperation between the two projects and maybe the start of something bigger, as in more cooperation campaigns between the two projects. As with everything-PIVX though, any further proposal will be required to be voted on by their community, but we are confident we may start seeing more joint proposals appearing in the future.</p><p>To track the proposal and its voting results, please follow this link: <a href=\"http://178.254.23.111/~pub/DN/DN_Info.html\">http://178.254.23.111/~pub/DN/DN_Info.html</a></p><h3 id=\"download-and-use-particl-desktop-1-2-2-before-it-is-released-\">Download and Use Particl Desktop 1.2.2 Before it is Released!</h3><p>Recently, most of the Particl Desktop development has been focused on the marketplace, but its wallet functions have also undergone quite a few major changes (and we fully expect the pace to pick up even more with our new Particl Desktop lead developer zaSmilingIdiot). In fact, you can download <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2\">Particl Desktop 1.2.2</a> today in its pre-release but stable version. This new Particl Desktop version is a major update on the <strong>mainnet</strong> wallet capabilities of Particl’s main client. A majority of its user interface has been improved upon as well as made more user-friendly and a lot of bugs and fixes were implemented to make the Particl Desktop experience as smooth as it has ever been!</p><h3 id=\"more-updates-being-made-to-the-website\">More Updates Being Made to the Website</h3><p>Our official website, particl.io, is currently undergoing major changes and updates. Indeed, Martin Allien, our UI/UX Front-End Developer, is currently revamping most of its text in order to make it accessible and approachable to a wider audience as well as adding new information pages. One such page is <a href=\"https://particl.io/coin-specifications/\">Coin Specifications</a>, a page entirely dedicated to giving a quick and to-the-point overview of the technical aspects of the Particl coin and blockchain.</p><p>To see all the latest changes made to the website, you can follow its commits on Github here: <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl.io/commits/master\">https://github.com/particl/particl.io/commits/master</a></p><h3 id=\"forum-update\">Forum Update</h3><p>Almost everything is ready to be released, but we are still resolving the final email issue which renders forum registration difficult. In most cases, confirmation emails (any email sent from the forum, for that matter) will either not reach the user’s inbox or directly land in the spam folder, a behavior which isn’t up to speed with what we want to offer our community.</p><p>If you wish, however, to test it out before it is revealed and give us some feedback, do not hesitate to contact Cryptoguard on either Telegram or Discord and he will send you the link as well as instructions on how to receive the registration email.</p><h3 id=\"bitcointalk-opening-post-being-revamped\">BitcoinTalk Opening Post Being Revamped</h3><p>At the same time as we are going over some of the aspects of our website, we are also working on refreshing our BitcoinTalk opening post as it is now severely outdated. Speaking of BitcoinTalk, we do believe that it needs to be more active. In fact, every time a comment is posted in it, it bumps the thread to the top of the list, thus giving us more exposure, if only for a brief moment. We are looking into some ways to make it more active, including linking the thread to a Discord room or to a Particl forum megathread. Linking the BCT thread to some other medium is not an immediate priority but will be something we will start looking into more seriously after we officially release the forum.</p><h3 id=\"particl-is-on-mastodon\">Particl is on Mastodon</h3><p>Did you know of Mastodon?

Though the feature is not available at the moment, it will be possible to use the project governance and marketplace governance systems even with coins that have their private keys stored on a Ledger Nano S. This feature will be part of our future Ledger integration onto Particl Desktop, but we cannot give any kind of ETA for the moment as it is not an immediate focus for any of our development team. We believe those users looking for the highest amount of security shouldn’t be penalized and taken out of the democratic process of the Particl community.</p><h3 id=\"will-particl-be-added-on-coinbase\">Will Particl be added on Coinbase?</h3><p>Imran, our Commercial &#x26; Partner Strategy Director, is always on the lookout for new exchanges as well as regularly keeping in touch with the more popular ones. There is a lot of back and forth going on at any moment with many exchanges and are positive that the interest for the Particl project is growing within the “exchange community” as we ourselves are slowly nearing the release of the marketplace (which would be our biggest milestone to date) and putting our money where our mouth is in terms of development. We cannot and will never, however, tell anyone in advance of a listing agreement before we officially and publicly announce it.</p><p>We have currently adjusted our strategy to mostly focus on the larger and more professional exchanges, those we believe are in it for the long run and have a solid legal foundation. We, of course, welcome smaller or new exchanges to list us, and we have no problem providing development support to those, but we might not go ahead and pay the listing fees anymore.</p><p>As for Coinbase more specifically, we know they have started adding new coins and will work on seizing that opportunity!</p><h3 id=\"will-private-listings-be-able-to-be-governed-by-the-community\">Will private listings be able to be governed by the community?</h3><p>Both public and private listings will be governable by the community exclusively, however, as private listings do not appear on the public interface of the marketplace, they are expected to be much more unlikely to be voted out by the community unless it leaks to the public or creates a controversy.</p><p>That is because listings need to reach a certain user flagging threshold to be taken out of the marketplace, and since private listings are hidden to the entire public except for those in possession of its unique key or link, this threshold should be much harder to reach.</p><p>This will ensure users can still transact privately between each other and do so away from the public eye, but should the transacted content be highly inappropriate and leaked out, the community will still possess the ability to clean its marketplace from it.</p><p>As for one on one private deals where the private keys never leak to any other party other than the ones involved, they simply won’t be possible to moderate out as the flagging threshold for the deletion of listings will be set too high for any or both parties to singlehandedly have enough governing influence over it.</p><h3 id=\"when-i-do-a-search-on-google-for-decentralized-marketplaces-other-projects-show-up-on-the-first-page-but-not-particl-why-is-that-and-what-are-the-team-s-thoughts-about-this\">When I do a search on Google for decentralized marketplaces, other projects show up on the first page, but not Particl. Why is that and what are the team’s thoughts about this?</h3><p>We believe there are many reasons for it. For one, we are a very young project, at least compared to some of the decentralized marketplace projects out there, having only been “live” on mainnet since the 17th of July 2017. It also could be due to our relatively smaller community size. In fact, having a smaller community, and especially one that resides mostly on instant messaging platforms such as Discord or Telegram, generates fewer discussions about the project on the web, which in turn makes us harder for the search engine algorithms to pick up.</p><p>It’s also important not to forget that Particl is not merely a decentralized marketplace, but a full-blown privacy-focused decentralized application platform. This means that our community discussions are not only focused on the decentralized marketplace aspect of the project but also stretch into our many other perks and related topics such as cold staking, dApps, RingCT, privacy, security, and etc. This is in contrast with other “competitors” (quotes have been added as we strongly believe we are carving our very own niche category of blockchains) that focus exclusively on decentralized eCommerce. The fact we are building Particl to be much more than a marketplace, we believe, is one of our strongest quality and while it may result in less focused and more diversified discussions, it will ultimately allow us to reach out to a more a diverse set of users.</p><p>Following a similar train of thought, we are also very cautious about not heavily promoting aspects of the project that is still in deep stages of development as delays and unforeseen issues can always arise, especially when building a platform as complex as Particl is.</p><p>While this is most probably about to change as we near the completion of the first mainnet version of Particl Marketplace, the above reasons might have contributed in part to Particl being harder to find when referencing decentralized marketplace discussions. Getting better search results will require time, more updates, users, and web-based discussions. The latter, for example, is expected to dramatically improve as we are just about to release our forum. We, in fact, believe that it will help carry some of the great discussions going on over on the instant messaging platforms to an indexable and web-based platform. <strong>Please see the dedicated forum section of this update further down the page.</strong></p><h3 id=\"a-while-ago-there-was-a-twitter-poll-about-stable-coins-wouldn-t-integrating-any-of-these-hinder-user-s-privacy-and-usability-by-requiring-kyc-aml-identifications-wouldn-t-that-defeat-the-entire-purpose-of-the-particl-project\">A while ago, there was a Twitter poll about stable coins. Wouldn’t integrating any of these hinder user’s privacy and usability by requiring KYC/AML identifications? Wouldn’t that defeat the entire purpose of the Particl project?</h3><p>It is true that some stable coins (or any potential third-party integration) require KYC/AML identification of users <strong>on their end </strong>to be utilized to their full potential, however, it is not going to be something that is required for the Particl platform to provide any of its critical features.</p><p>For clarification purposes, this poll was meant as a fun way for us to get to know our community better. Stable coins, like the poll’s winner Digix, possess the interesting ability to maintain some kind of stable valuation (i.e. 1 DGX = 1g of physical gold, 1 USDt = ~1 USD, and etc). This can be super useful for people wishing to opt out of the fiat system, but also avoid the volatility usually associated with the cryptocurrency market.</p><p>Rest assured, any non-PART Particl Marketplace transaction still needs to, and will always need to, be settled in PART as it requires the coin’s RingCT capabilities to protect users’ privacy and also because the marketplace’s MAD escrow system is based on a Particl smart-contract that can only work using PART coins similarly to how Ether is the fuel for Ethereum-based smart-contracts and is required for them to execute.</p><p>Stable coins, in the case of Particl, are very interesting because they allow users to get the best of both the fiat and crypto world: an arguably stable means to store value that can be readily be spent on anything available on the Particl Marketplace. In that sense, both the marketplace and stable coins give each other a great use-case that comes very close to an eCommerce experience regular people are used to dealing with.</p><p>Note that it is possible for third-party integrations to require KYC/AML identifications, but that will <strong>always</strong> we offered as an option and will <strong>never </strong>be mandatory as that would directly go against our mission and what we stand for.</p><h3 id=\"is-the-team-aware-of-the-nothing-at-stake-attack-on-pos-consensus-algorithms-and-if-so-how-does-it-intend-to-fix-this-vulnerability\">Is the team aware of the Nothing-At-Stake attack on PoS consensus algorithms and if so, how does it intend to fix this vulnerability?</h3><p>Yes, the team is very aware of this often-promoted-by-PoW-advocates vulnerability of the Proof-of-Stake algorithm and has implemented checkpoints to mitigate this issue. We recommend joining the Open Development channel on Discord and chat with our developer Kewde to get more in-depth insights about how we have designed the Particl blockchain to be protected against this attack precisely.</p><h3 id=\"is-the-ringct-protocol-ready-for-mainnet-or-does-it-still-requires-some-tweaks-as-indicated-by-either-the-njit-department-of-technology-academic-report-or-wsa-s-security-audit\">Is the RingCT protocol ready for mainnet or does it still requires some tweaks as indicated by either the NJIT Department of Technology academic report or WSA’s security audit?</h3><p>Yes, both the academic report and security audit have indicated that no issue was found with our Bitcoin-based implementation of the RingCT protocol. As many of you already know, this implementation has been on testnet ever since we launched Particl on the 17th of July 2017 and thus is virtually ready for mainnet implementation.</p><p>Note that, as the RingCT hardfork will be combined (subject to change) with the marketplace governance one, it will have to wait until the latter is ready for mainnet implementation. It will be announced several weeks in advance for users to be aware of it coming.</p><h3 id=\"is-ringct-on-marketplace-transactions-a-requirement-for-particl-marketplace-mainnet\">Is RingCT on marketplace transactions a requirement for Particl Marketplace mainnet?</h3><p>Most likely. RingCT is tentatively planned on being hardforked at the same time as the marketplace governance system which is an absolute requirement for the marketplace to be released on mainnet. We have started to look into Bulletproofs, which is the RingCT/CT protocol improvement that should reduce privacy transaction sizes by about 80%, and might even add it to the hardfork.</p><p>The first step to enhancing our escrow system is to put CT on it, then shifting to RingCT should be pretty easy. Ultimately, the only absolute requirement for the marketplace is the governance system, and it would be unlikely that it would release without RingCT escrow as well, instead putting CT on the marketplace for a while, but this is not out of the question neither. We will keep you updated about this as we know more.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-moin-why-are-they-looking-into-forking-the-particl-codebase-and-what-impact-would-that-carry-for-the-particl-project\">What is MOIN? Why are they looking into forking the Particl codebase and what impact would that carry for the Particl project?</h3><p>MOIN is a small hobby project which is not associated in any way with the Particl team but their lead developer is on good terms with our Lead Graphic &#x26; Branding Designer CRZ. MOIN was started as a Shadowcash fork and just like we did in the past, probably realize how outdated this codebase is getting.</p><p>While we haven’t really received any information from them as of late, we did suggest to them that they increase their supply when hardforking and airdrop it to Particl holders as a token of appreciation and to cross-pollinate both communities.</p><h3 id=\"what-makes-particl-better-than-its-competition\">What makes Particl better than its competition?</h3><p>Particl has a lot of things going for it. One very important aspect is the fact that we have a coin which a community can rally behind. This is missing from OpenBazaar, which we believe they might start seeing the use of having one as they are planning on integrating some kind of token to their decentralized marketplace.</p><p>But the most important factors which makes us much different than <strong>any </strong>of our competitors is our focus on both security, privacy, and true decentralization without compromise. In fact, in the case of Syscoin’s Blockmarket marketplace, it is moderated by the Syscoin staff itself and in the case of OpenBazaar, they employ moderators. Both of these competitors also make use of a centralized form of escrow which not only makes the platforms less scalable (more people need to be hired or moderating as the more users start using these platforms), but it also leaves the door wide open for collusion between a staff member or escrow agent and one of the parties involved.</p><p>While it may seem unlikely that a third-party would collude with another party, it is actually more common than it seems. It is also possible for a third-party to make a wrong or bad decision when the participants of a marketplace transaction that’s been put in “conflict” cannot agree on any resolution or if one of them is lying to the escrow agent. There are countless examples where moderated deals can go bad, and we’d rather put 100% of the responsibility to the participating users themselves rather than a moderating party.</p><p>For a more detailed breakdown of Particl’s advantages over its competitors, you can refer back to a Reddit post made by Cryptoguard here: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/8k3kv2/what_are_the_competitive_advantages_of_particl/dz559jr\">https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/8k3kv2/what_are_the_competitive_advantages_of_particl/dz559jr</a></p><h3 id=\"are-there-any-plans-on-sending-more-particl-team-members-to-more-conferences-and-meetups\">Are there any plans on sending more Particl team members to more conferences and meetups?</h3><p>Absolutely! When we went to this year’s edition of the Consensus Conference, we noticed that we were one of the only projects with an actual product to show for, even though only on its Alpha version. This, in turn, attracted a lot of attention from the conference’s participants and we also were quite impressed by the number of people that actually knew about what we were building. This tells us that we need to have an increased presence in conferences as the sentiment we received from our short time in Consensus was quite positive.</p><p>Our budget is, however, quite limited for now as we are in a deep development phase and more focused on hiring developers to release our product than hyping “vaporware”. Sending team members and representatives to conferences, crypto-themed, and others will definitely be part of our budget once we go through our Primary Funding Round where we aim to raise much more capital than we did during the coin swap.</p><p>We would, nonetheless, support any community member desiring to present Particl in meetups or conferences. If you plan on attending or speaking to one such event, let us know and we will assist you with material and look into what you would need to make the presentation more impactful. Don’t hesitate to contact Paul Schmitzer, our Communications Manager, or Cryptoguard, our Community Manager, if you are interested.</p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &#x26; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"ledger-staking-tutorial-is-now-available-\">Ledger Staking Tutorial is Now Available!</h3><p>We announced on the 7th of August that Particl was finally able to be managed from Ledger Nano S hardware devices, with cold staking enabled. However, at the time of the announcement, no tutorial on how to enable hardware cold staking was available. This changed on the 17th of August when we officially published a proper tutorial on how to activate cold staking on these devices, <strong>making Particl the world’s safest Proof-of-Stake protocol</strong>. To enable your Ledger Nano S hardware device for cold staking, simply follow the steps included in this tutorial: <a href=\"https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking\">https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking</a></p><p><em><strong>Note: </strong></em><em>While this tutorial is pretty straight-forward, it may be reserved for the more advanced users. If you do not want to mess with the debug window or some of the more advanced features of the Particl blockchain, it is recommended that you wait for the Particl Desktop integration which will come at a later time.</em></p><h3 id=\"new-particl-desktop-developer-s-first-commit\">New Particl Desktop Developer’s First Commit</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--5/1-pPTQ44Cy-aSYxa4DOKe8yw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>As mentioned a few times already, we hired a new developer in July to lead and oversee the development of our Particl Desktop client (as well as potentially working on Particl Copay), the centerpiece of the Particl platform, starting on August 1st, 2018. He has now started reviewing our entire Particl Desktop code and <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1113\">has even pushed his first commit</a>, a rather large one, on Github which shows great professionalism. In fact, <a href=\"https://github.com/zaSmilingIdiot\">zaSmilingIdiot</a> has a lot of experience working with large teams of developers and his work methodology will surely be a great asset to our project and its development pace. Consult his first PR by following this link: <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1113\">https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1113</a></p><p>It is worth noting that, whenever you log into Github and consult pull requests, Github will indicate you, upon consulting at a later time, of the new changes and updates made to the pull request since the last time you looked at it. This can be quite useful when tracking the development progress of the project.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--5/1-tL7afRrDjl94gy4OKkl6nQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Pull Request Updates Indicator</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"new-status-report-published-includes-new-exciting-developments\">New Status Report Published Includes New Exciting Developments</h3><p>Speaking of development, we’ve published on the 20th of August a new Status Report showing the project’s progress. While it contains similar items as our last Status Report, several of them have been moved to the “Waiting for Review” category, meaning they’ve been completed and are undergoing the final testing phase. These items include Particl Desktop 1.2.2 (<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2\">which is already available to anyone as a stable mainnet pre-release</a>) <strong>and the long-awaited marketplace governance system (version 1.0)</strong>. If all the testing goes well, we should see the governance mechanism appear in some form or the other on Particl Marketplace Alpha (<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2\">can be downloaded here</a>) in the coming weeks.</p><h3 id=\"staking-pools-incoming-\">Staking Pools Incoming!</h3><p>One of the biggest takeaway one can get from our latest Status Report is the inclusion of staking pool related features in the “In Development” category. This is directly in relation to our commitment to offer secure but accessible options to ALL of our users and will also potentially strengthen the Particl network by incentivizing even more users to run their own node. In fact, Tecnovert, our Core Lead Developer, has started working on a cold staking pool proof-of-concept that would allow any user to stake their funds and receive constant rewards regardless of the amount they hold. As it currently stands, anyone, big or small holder, can put up their funds for staking, but those with smaller balances may find the process impractical as staking rewards are paid in ~1.24 PART increments. A user holding only 50 PART, for example, would need to wait several months in between staking rewards.</p><p>With a staking pool, anyone can dedicate their staking powers to a staking pool which has the ability to send out staking reward payments in smaller increments, similarly to how proof-of-work mining pools allow multiple users to pool up their hashing powers to receive smaller but more numerous payments.</p><p>More details about this feature will be given at a later time.</p><h3 id=\"marketplace-and-project-governance-are-about-to-hit-testnet-\">Marketplace and Project Governance are About to Hit Testnet!</h3><p>Our governance mechanisms have seen a lot of progress being made to them in the last few weeks, and are now imminently reaching a point where they will start being integrated onto our testnet network for community testing. This will mark a very important milestone in the development of the Particl project, and can be tentatively expected for the new few weeks.</p><p>We hope to get as many testers as possible as the more people test these features, the more effectively we can identify bugs, improvements to be made, and such, which in turns can result in these features hitting mainnet more quickly. These are exciting times for the project and the pieces are starting to fall into place!</p><h3 id=\"a-new-video-showing-the-impressive-amount-of-work-put-into-particl-since-its-inception\">A New Video Showing the Impressive Amount of Work Put Into Particl Since its Inception</h3><p>Today we want to give you guys a sneak peek of a blog post that will likely come out next week. Using an open-source Github activity analysis tool, we were able to produce a mindblowing video highlighting the mindblowing amount of work that our development team has put into Particl since its inception.</p><p>In this video, the users moving around are blockchain developers. Those with their names written in green are Particl developers, and those with their names written in grey are Bitcoin developers. It highlights several of our development repositories (meaning repos like Particl.io, Branding, Whitepaper, and such are excluded), including Particl Core, Particl Desktop, Particl Market, OMP-Lib, and other repos instrumental to the development of the project.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iaaEG15n7zY?feature=oembed\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>It is particularly interesting to not only see how relentless our developers are regardless of the overall cryptocurrency market situation but also how keeping our codebase up-to-date with the latest Bitcoin Core version positively impacts the project. In fact, while Bitcoin Core developers do not work on Particl Core at all, their work on the Bitcoin codebase is still reflected on ours, granting us all the latest performance, stability, security, and usability developments made over Bitcoin Core. More videos, including isolated repositories such as Particl Desktop, will be posted in a coming dedicated blog post. Stay tuned!</p><h3 id=\"the-pivx-particl-alliance-voting-round-is-an-overwhelming-success-\">The PIVX-Particl Alliance Voting Round is an Overwhelming Success!</h3><p>We announced not too long ago that we had struck an agreement with the PIVX community to set up a vote for an alliance where they would get listed to the Particl Marketplace (as with every other coins, non-PART Particl Marketplace transactions still need to be ultimately settled in PART) and we would get listed on zDEX. Then, both marketing/social media teams would collaborate together for some cross-promotion, promoting privacy, security, and decentralization (more details here: <a href=\"https://forum.pivx.org/t/particl-application-for-pivx-alliance/4379\">https://forum.pivx.org/t/particl-application-for-pivx-alliance/4379</a>).</p><p>The voting round has been initiated on PIVX’s end, and it is safe to say that the proposal has been an overwhelming success! In fact, as it currently stands, the votes are 330 in favor of the alliance, and 4 are against it. We are very happy to see the PIVX community interested in joining forces with us and cooperate with a fellow privacy and decentralization-minded project! We take it as a huge stepping stone for cooperation between the two projects and maybe the start of something bigger, as in more cooperation campaigns between the two projects. As with everything-PIVX though, any further proposal will be required to be voted on by their community, but we are confident we may start seeing more joint proposals appearing in the future.</p><p>To track the proposal and its voting results, please follow this link: <a href=\"http://178.254.23.111/~pub/DN/DN_Info.html\">http://178.254.23.111/~pub/DN/DN_Info.html</a></p><h3 id=\"download-and-use-particl-desktop-1-2-2-before-it-is-released-\">Download and Use Particl Desktop 1.2.2 Before it is Released!</h3><p>Recently, most of the Particl Desktop development has been focused on the marketplace, but its wallet functions have also undergone quite a few major changes (and we fully expect the pace to pick up even more with our new Particl Desktop lead developer zaSmilingIdiot). In fact, you can download <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2\">Particl Desktop 1.2.2</a> today in its pre-release but stable version. This new Particl Desktop version is a major update on the <strong>mainnet</strong> wallet capabilities of Particl’s main client.

In most cases, confirmation emails (any email sent from the forum, for that matter) will either not reach the user’s inbox or directly land in the spam folder, a behavior which isn’t up to speed with what we want to offer our community.</p><p>If you wish, however, to test it out before it is revealed and give us some feedback, do not hesitate to contact Cryptoguard on either Telegram or Discord and he will send you the link as well as instructions on how to receive the registration email.</p><h3 id=\"bitcointalk-opening-post-being-revamped\">BitcoinTalk Opening Post Being Revamped</h3><p>At the same time as we are going over some of the aspects of our website, we are also working on refreshing our BitcoinTalk opening post as it is now severely outdated. Speaking of BitcoinTalk, we do believe that it needs to be more active. In fact, every time a comment is posted in it, it bumps the thread to the top of the list, thus giving us more exposure, if only for a brief moment. We are looking into some ways to make it more active, including linking the thread to a Discord room or to a Particl forum megathread.

Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\nWill it be possible to have prices displayed in their fiat value?\nWhile currently not available on Particl Marketplace Alpha, yes, this is\nsomething that ultimately would be part of Particl Marketplace. Paul speculated\nabout how this feature could look like in Particl Desktop, but the takeaway\npoint is that this wouldn’t be hard to include on the marketplace and is a\nfeature that will, in the end, be enabled.\n\nWill there be a “Share” feature where vendors will be able to send a link to\ntheir product listing on the web?\nEverything is “social” right now, so being able to share a listing is a vital\nfunction for a marketplace. This is actually how private listings are designed.\nIn fact, the entire nature of private listings is that they aren’t displayed on\nthe public interface of the marketplace and can only be accessed through a\ncustom link or key. It hasn’t been settled yet whether this sharing feature\nwould also be available on public listings but it should ultimately be.\n\nWe’ll also soon be publishing an interview with Albin from Mubiz. Mubiz is a web\n& mobile decentralized marketplace gateway that makes available buying items on\ndecentralized marketplaces using their website just like any other eCommerce\nplatform. They do plan on integrating Particl into their platform which would\nmake the sharing of listings very easy (simply copy-paste the URL link).\n\nIs it possible to have the order at which releases will be ready without any\nspecific dates?\nThe two biggest items required for Particl Marketplace to go live on mainnet are\nthe marketplace governance system and the RingCT privacy protocol. As we are\nalso heavily focused on security, we always prefer introducing features on\ntestnet first, especially major updates such as the governance system and the\nRingCT protocol. As most of you already know, RingCT has been on our mainnet\never since Day 1 but has only recently been validated by both the NJIT\nDepartment of Security academic review and WeSecureApp’s audit.\n\nWe can also confirm by now that RingCT and the marketplace governance tool are\ngoing to be part of the same hardfork. This should give a good idea of what the\nnext steps are going to be: the marketplace governance system is going to hit\ntestnet then, after proper testing, will be integrated onto Particl mainnet\nintegration alongside RingCT.\n\nThere are, of course, other features that may hit testnet or mainnet within that\ntimeframe, but as far as the critical path to Particl Marketplace mainnet\nrelease goes, governance and RingCT are the two items to look out for.\n\nAs always, you can always have a look at our Status Report which should be\nupdated soon.\n\nHave a notification system for vendors been put in place?\nAbsolutely, as you can see in our Status Report, this feature has been\nintegrated onto Particl Marketplace and is currently in its final review phase.\n\nHas the new Particl Desktop developer started working yet?\nYes, his first day with us was on August 1st. We’ll soon make a blog post\nintroducing him to the community as well as linking to his Github account like\nwe usually do.\n\nAny new Particl merchandise coming up?\nYes, it’s definitely going to happen. We have started looking into various types\nof merch we would like to giveaway to the community and have even made a poll\non\nTwitter asking for your suggestions\n[https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1027253285277900801].\n\nWe’re planning on both giving merch away on Particl Marketplace Alpha but also\nusing our new Discord GiveawayBot which we used to run our Ledger Nano S contest\nwith. Keep an eye out for any future announcement of free merch being made\navailable!\n\nIs there any update about the PIVX Alliance conference call?\nYes, we had Imran, Ryno, and Cryptoguard participate in that call and we agreed\nwith PIVX to submit a proposal to the PIVX community. The proposal states that\nPART would get listed on PIVX for free in exchange for a PIVX integration right\ninto Particl Marketplace. The two social media teams would then help each other\nout with some cross-promotion campaign.\n\nBoth teams have also discussed doing a zPIV integration to Particl Marketplace,\neffectively allowing users to combine both Zerocoin and RingCT privacy protocols\nin a single transaction for the ultimate privacy package. This integration\nwould, however, be a monster of itself. Both teams are interested in this\nconcept and it could definitely make for a great joint project. For the moment,\nboth teams have a lot on their plate and have other priorities, but it’s\ndefinitely being kept in mind on both sides.\n\nThe proposal hasn’t been voted on by the PIVX community yet, we will be giving\nout details when that happens. It will be interesting to see how this pans out!\n\nEDIT: For clarity’s sake, PIVX transactions on the marketplace will still\nultimately be converted into PART so that the marketplace can run its MAD escrow\nsmart-contract and utilize the RingCT protocol offered by PART.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nLedger Hardware Integration is Here!\nUpdate [10–08–2018]: There is a known issue with setting up Ledger on Particl-Qt\nMacOS. Mac users should download Particl-Qt 0.16.2.0 (pre-release) by following\nthis link: https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.16.2.0\n\nUpdate [10–08–2018]: The tutorial for cold staking from your Ledger Nano S is\ncurrently not available. Our team is working on figuring the best temporary\nsolution to allow staking while the full Ledger integration onto Particl Desktop\nis completed. More details about both the tutorial and the Particl Desktop\nintegration will be given out in further updates.\n\nUpdate [10–08–2018]: Your Particl balance will not show up on Ledger Live’s\nPortfolio interface. The Particl Ledger application currently only supports\nstoring Particl on the Ledger Nano S and using the Particl features (staking,\nvoting, transacting, etc). Ledger Live’s Portfolio may or may not come at a\nlater time, this mostly depends on Ledger.\n\nParticl, Bitcoin & PIVX on the Ledger NanoAfter having submitted our own Ledger\n“third-party application\n[https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005161545-List-of-supported-applications]\n” to Ledger [https://www.ledger.com/] weeks ago, it has finally been officially\nintegrated into Ledger’s Nano S hardware devices\n[https://www.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s] and Ledger Live\n[https://www.ledger.com/pages/ledger-live]. That means you can now safely store\nyour PART private keys on the Ledger Nano S device, dramatically increasing the\nsecurity of your funds as well as the entire ecosystem. This also makes Particl\nthe first pure Proof-of-Stake coin to offer hardware cold staking, or even just\nsimply hardware staking.\n\n> As a matter of fact, no matter how strong your passwords are or safely hidden\nyour wallet files are, you are still putting yourself at great risk of getting\nhacked the moment you either enter a password or upload a wallet file on a\ncomputer or mobile device. Indeed, cryptocurrencies have become one of the prime\ntargets for hackers and cyber thieves, and there are now several ways infected\ncomputers could result in the total loss of coins stored on unsafe wallets.—\nParticl Introduces Hardware Cold Staking\n[https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae]\nThe Ledger Nano S [https://www.ledger.com/] is a hardware wallet, a special type\nof bitcoin wallet which stores the user’s private keys in a secure hardware\ndevice. They have major advantages over standard software wallets: private keys\nare stored in a secure chip, and cannot be transferred out of the device in\nplaintext. That means your funds are safe even when connected to an infected or\nmalicious computer or a phishing/scam web page.\n— Manage Particl on Ledger Nano S [http://particl.wiki/ledger]\n\nFurthermore, we strongly believe those looking for the highest level of security\nshouldn’t be limited in what they can do on the Particl platform, especially as\nit relates to its governance (true democracy -> no voice left unheard). As such,\nthis Ledger integration is designed to be compatible with almost all, if not\nstraight up all the functions of the Particl platform including, but not limited\nto, transacting funds, staking, voting and submitting proposals to the community\nas well as participating in the marketplace’s governance system without ever\nrequiring to expose their private keys.\n\nThis announcement marks a very important step in Particl’s journey,\ndemonstrating the team’s commitment to not only build the most secure blockchain\nsolutions but to also deliver them in a perfectly accessible and flexible\npackage that does not infringe on the user experience.\n\nDecentralized Project Governance\nWe also posted this week about the new and improved decentralized project\ngovernance\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6] that\nis nearing testnet implementation. In fact, we identified several issues with\nour legacy voting system (which has been on mainnet since Day 1) that makes it\ntoo restrictive in nature for what the Particl platform is aiming to do.\n\nThe main difference between the new governance system and the legacy one resides\nin the fact that any user will be able to vote for multiple proposals at the\nsame time and do so directly from Particl Desktop regardless of if their funds\nare stored on a hot, cold, paper, or hardware wallet. We believe this update to\nthe Project Governance system is a huge improvement both in terms of usability\nand democratic accurateness, and so we are very excited to run it through its\nfinal testing phase and to begin testnet integration.\n\nWe also announced in our Decentralized Project Governance update\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6] that\nthere were a total of ~33,800 PART\n[https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/address.dws?RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM.htm] \nleft in the Community Initiative Fund and that we would be ready to initiate\nvoting rounds on what to do with the funds once the Project Governance tool hits\nmainnet. As such, it could be a good idea to start thinking about proposals and\nideas on how to best use the 33,800 PART that does belong to the community.\n\nParticl Core 0.17.0.2…Really?!?\nFor those keeping a close eye on Particl’s Github page, it may not come out as a\nsurprise that Tecnovert [https://github.com/tecnovert], our Core Developer &\nCryptographic Researcher, has ALREADY started working on Particl Core 0.17.0.2\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.0.2alpha]. TV is\nknown for being the fastest developer in the entire industry to adapt and merge\nthe latest Bitcoin codebase into Particl Core whenever there is an update to it.\nUsually, it takes a few weeks, sometimes even days after the release. But this\ntime, it seems like Tecnovert has been working overtime on 0.17, so it will be\ninteresting to see if he has anything special under the hood or if he’s just\nbeing extremely diligent.\n\nFor a rough 0.17 release timeline from Bitcoin Core, please visit this link: \nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/12624.\n\nNew Status Report\nWe released on the third of August a new Status Report on our website\n[http://particl.io/status-report/]. This report is quite similar to our \nprevious\nStatus Report [https://particl.news/new-status-report-released-8ca69930cfd] but\nalso contains some new, exciting information about the state of Particl\nMarketplace development. Indeed, the “Wrapped Up” section of the report shows\nthat a lot of items for the marketplace have been completed, including the\nProject Governance and Marketplace Governance tools. Some of the items marked as\n“Pending Review” have also been completed since we posted this report 7 days\nago, including the Ledger hardware integration\n[https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae] and\nthe Particl Desktop 1.2.2\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2] (currently on\npre-release, mainnet). A new Status Report should be posted soon and we will\npost an update here on particl.news [http://particl.news].\n\nDevelopment is at an All-Time High!\nJiraThe development process of the Particl project has never been in such good\nshape. Indeed, the project has reached a stage where our team has gained a lot\nof experience and have adapted their work methods to better organize and deliver\nmore efficiently. That much can be seen on our Github with as much as 3 to 6\nrepositories being updated daily and by how fast items in our Status Report are\ngetting hammered.\n\nA lot of this can be attributed to our two new managers, Carmen and Vivienne, as\nwell as the new Agile methodologies [https://linchpinseo.com/the-agile-method/] \nand strategies the team has established during its last meeting in Prague. It is\nworth noting that Github is only the tip of the iceberg, most of the development\nprocess and communications happening internally using Jira\n[https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira].\n\nAs we are seeing a lot of items being marked as completed and as we keep hiring\nnew developers such as our new Particl Desktop developer or any developer we\nwill be hiring after the primary funding round, the Particl project is slowly\nentering into a new phase. We will soon reach a point where a lot of the pieces\nwill start falling into place in a relatively short period of time while the\ndevelopment pace keeps increasing. Furthermore, the future release of our\ndeveloper SDK should also attract many more “outside” developers contributing\nthemselves to the accelerating development pace of the project. Simply put, we\nbelieve our best days are ahead of us and at arm’s length.\n\nTeaser: We will post next week a video demonstrating the impressive work our\ndevelopers have put into Particl since we embarked on this journey a little more\nthan a year ago. This demonstration will be in the form of a Github contribution\ntimeline and will help understand several factors associated with the\ndevelopment of an open-source project. This will be a must-watch, so stay alert\nfor a post on particl.news [http://particl.news]!\n\nExciting Interview Coming (Web & Mobile Interface)\nThose around the community for some time have probably heard about Albin at some\npoint or another. In fact, Albin, the owner of Mubiz, a decentralized\nmarketplace gateway currently offering services for the OpenBazaar protocol, has\nbeen around the Particl project for some time, even being going as far back as\nthe Shadowcash times. Turns out this entrepreneur has big plans for Particl!\n\nWith the desire to integrate Particl onto its decentralized marketplace gateway\nplatform, Mubiz will undoubtedly become an enormous piece of the puzzle for\nParticl to go mainstream by offering a modern and responsive web & mobile\ninterface (currently under FULL revamping) and by taking care of all the\ntechy/geeky stuff like MAD escrow, crypto payments, customer support, and\nreturns. Yes, you read that right!\n\nStay tuned for this exclusive, ground-breaking interview where Albin will lay\ndown his vision for Particl and decentralized marketplaces in general and\nexplain exactly how he intends to make all the cryptocurrency and blockchain\nprocesses operate in the background, leaving users with a user-experience no\ndifferent than any other web-based marketplace. We also will be able to show you\nan EXCLUSIVE look into Mubiz’s new platform that will launch within a few\nmonths, in time for the Particl Marketplace mainnet release.\n\nWebsite Redesign & Particl Wiki Update\nWe’ve also been recently busy with revamping our official website\n[http://particl.io]. While there are definitely elements we like about it, we’ve\nidentified, helped by the generous community feedback, a few issues, and\nimprovements that could be made to it in order to make it more impactful. You\ncan visit the website right now and already see that we have started merging\nsome changes to it, currently mainly being focused on the header (more dynamic,\nmore engaging). We will also be rewriting a lot of the texts on it to make it\nclearer, more accessible, and easy-to-understand for anyone to know what it is\nthat the Particl project is all about.\n\nParticl Wiki [https://particl.wiki/] has also been updated following the release\nof the Ledger hardware integration. Several pages such as the FAQ\n[http://particl.wiki/faq] and the What Is [http://particki.wiki/what-is] article\nhave indeed been updated to add information about Ledger.\n\nParticl Discourse\nParticl DiscourseAnother thing we have been putting together has been the\nParticl Discourse forum. We’ve unfortunately run into some issues which have\ndelayed its release but are happy to announce today these issues have been\nresolved except for one. The forum is currently being configured and set up and\nshould most probably be made available next week.\n\nWe will be posting a proper update as well as a complete presentation of the new\nplatform and the vision we have for it next week. Stay tuned and follow our \nparticl.news [http://particl.news] blog to get notified of every update we\npublish!\n\nNew Particl Foundation Financial Report\nThe Particl Foundation has posted a new financial report on its official website\n[http://particl.foundation/financial-reports].

Paul speculated about how this feature could look like in Particl Desktop, but the takeaway point is that this wouldn’t be hard to include on the marketplace and is a feature that will, in the end, be enabled.</p><h3 id=\"will-there-be-a-share-feature-where-vendors-will-be-able-to-send-a-link-to-their-product-listing-on-the-web\">Will there be a “Share” feature where vendors will be able to send a link to their product listing on the web?</h3><p>Everything is “social” right now, so being able to share a listing is a vital function for a marketplace. This is actually how private listings are designed. In fact, the entire nature of private listings is that they aren’t displayed on the public interface of the marketplace and can only be accessed through a custom link or key. It hasn’t been settled yet whether this sharing feature would also be available on public listings but it should ultimately be.</p><p>We’ll also soon be publishing an interview with Albin from Mubiz. Mubiz is a web &#x26; mobile decentralized marketplace gateway that makes available buying items on decentralized marketplaces using their website just like any other eCommerce platform. They do plan on integrating Particl into their platform which would make the sharing of listings very easy (simply copy-paste the URL link).</p><h3 id=\"is-it-possible-to-have-the-order-at-which-releases-will-be-ready-without-any-specific-dates\">Is it possible to have the order at which releases will be ready without any specific dates?</h3><p>The two biggest items required for Particl Marketplace to go live on mainnet are the marketplace governance system and the RingCT privacy protocol. As we are also heavily focused on security, we always prefer introducing features on testnet first, especially major updates such as the governance system and the RingCT protocol. As most of you already know, RingCT has been on our mainnet ever since Day 1 but has only recently been validated by both the NJIT Department of Security academic review and WeSecureApp’s audit.</p><p>We can also confirm by now that RingCT and the marketplace governance tool are going to be part of the same hardfork. This should give a good idea of what the next steps are going to be: the marketplace governance system is going to hit testnet then, after proper testing, will be integrated onto Particl mainnet integration alongside RingCT.</p><p>There are, of course, other features that may hit testnet or mainnet within that timeframe, but as far as the critical path to Particl Marketplace mainnet release goes, governance and RingCT are the two items to look out for.</p><p>As always, you can always have a look at our Status Report which should be updated soon.</p><h3 id=\"have-a-notification-system-for-vendors-been-put-in-place\">Have a notification system for vendors been put in place?</h3><p>Absolutely, as you can see in our Status Report, this feature has been integrated onto Particl Marketplace and is currently in its final review phase.</p><h3 id=\"has-the-new-particl-desktop-developer-started-working-yet\">Has the new Particl Desktop developer started working yet?</h3><p>Yes, his first day with us was on August 1st. We’ll soon make a blog post introducing him to the community as well as linking to his Github account like we usually do.</p><h3 id=\"any-new-particl-merchandise-coming-up\">Any new Particl merchandise coming up?</h3><p>Yes, it’s definitely going to happen. We have started looking into various types of merch we would like to giveaway to the community and have even made a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1027253285277900801\">poll on Twitter asking for your suggestions</a>.</p><p>We’re planning on both giving merch away on Particl Marketplace Alpha but also using our new Discord GiveawayBot which we used to run our Ledger Nano S contest with. Keep an eye out for any future announcement of free merch being made available!</p><h3 id=\"is-there-any-update-about-the-pivx-alliance-conference-call\">Is there any update about the PIVX Alliance conference call?</h3><p>Yes, we had Imran, Ryno, and Cryptoguard participate in that call and we agreed with PIVX to submit a proposal to the PIVX community. The proposal states that PART would get listed on PIVX for free in exchange for a PIVX integration right into Particl Marketplace. The two social media teams would then help each other out with some cross-promotion campaign.</p><p>Both teams have also discussed doing a zPIV integration to Particl Marketplace, effectively allowing users to combine both Zerocoin and RingCT privacy protocols in a single transaction for the ultimate privacy package. This integration would, however, be a monster of itself. Both teams are interested in this concept and it could definitely make for a great joint project. For the moment, both teams have a lot on their plate and have other priorities, but it’s definitely being kept in mind on both sides.</p><p>The proposal hasn’t been voted on by the PIVX community yet, we will be giving out details when that happens. It will be interesting to see how this pans out!</p><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> <em>For clarity’s sake, PIVX transactions on the marketplace will still ultimately be converted into PART so that the marketplace can run its MAD escrow smart-contract and utilize the RingCT protocol offered by PART.</em></p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &#x26; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"ledger-hardware-integration-is-here-\">Ledger Hardware Integration is Here!</h3><p><strong>Update [10–08–2018]: </strong><em>There is a known issue with setting up Ledger on Particl-Qt MacOS.

Yes, you read that right!</p><p><strong>Stay tuned for this exclusive, ground-breaking interview where Albin will lay down his vision for Particl and decentralized marketplaces in general and explain exactly how he intends to make all the cryptocurrency and blockchain processes operate in the background, leaving users with a user-experience no different than any other web-based marketplace. We also will be able to show you an EXCLUSIVE look into Mubiz’s new platform that will launch within a few months, in time for the Particl Marketplace mainnet release.</strong></p><h3 id=\"website-redesign-particl-wiki-update\">Website Redesign &#x26; Particl Wiki Update</h3><p>We’ve also been recently busy with revamping our <a href=\"http://particl.io\">official website</a>.
