This\nweek, we've made important progress and have been improving both Particl Desktop\nand the marketplace with a few bug fixes and tweaks to the code.\n\nNotably, we can report that the migration of Particl Desktop from Particl Core\nversion 0.19x to 0.21 is now complete. Although there has been a fair amount of\ntesting already, the team is looking to test it out more to ensure no issue\narises (as you can remember, Particl Core 0.21 introduced many changes that\ntouch on several aspects of the marketplace) before pushing it live. However, we\ncan confirm that Particl Core 0.21x will be the core version of Particl Desktop\n3.1.\n\nOther than that, a good portion of this week's focus has gone towards fixing a\nfew bugs and implementing improvements to both the desktop client and the\nmarketplace. Among these, we improved on the code that displayed the number of\nPART \"locked\" on Particl Desktop. In some cases, the indicated amount was simply\ninaccurate, leading to some users (in rare cases) seeing more \"locked\" coins\nthan they even owned in the first place. This was merely a display bug and has\nbeen fixed.\n\nFinally, another minor display issue has been improved. When converting funds\nfrom one type to another (i.e., public to anon), the Overview page only\ndisplayed the fee paid for the conversion instead of what amount was converted.\nThis is now fixed and will go live in the next version of Particl Desktop.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Development Progress\nThe list of outstanding tasks remains the same as last week's, with one item now\nbeing complete (migrating to Particl Core 0.21). As mentioned in the\nintroduction of this progress report, a lot of the work has gone towards fixing\nsome bugs and integrating improvements to both Particl Desktop and the\nmarketplace.\n\nAs soon as the OMP Library bug is fixed, development will resume on these items:\n\n * Update Particl Desktop and particl-market (marketplace codebase) to use\n   Particl Core 0.21. This task is now complete. \n * Several features related to better vendor inventory import/update. This\n   includes the provision of a product code (allowing for updates to items via\n   CSV amongst other things), the ability to update pricing via the batch\n   publish window, and the ability to import images through the CSV file\n   directly (with the possibility to specify the category and target market\n   directly from the CSV coming soon as well). This task is currently in\n   progress.\n * The usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace for better,\n   more customizable formatting. This task has already been started but has been\n   put on pause until the above items are completed. It is estimated that this\n   item will be completed very quickly once its development resumes.\n * Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address\n   requirement (i.e., download links, NFTs, user codes, etc.). This task has not\n   been started yet.\n\nToday, we want to provide additional information regarding the \"ability to\nupdate pricing via the batch publish window\".\n\nThis new feature, or rather, an improvement to the batch re-publish feature, is\na way for sellers to quickly batch update their listing prices without having to\nchange them one by one. This is particularly useful for sellers with many\nlistings who want to limit their exposure to PART price volatility.\n\nThis new feature is intended to work as follows, with potential changes being\nmade while it's being coded in (aka, functions not set in stone yet):\n\n * In the batch re-publish window, display the current prices per individual\n   product.\n * Display the \"new\" prices per product that the seller wants to set.\n * Include a global percentage modifier; setting this increments each product's\n   price by the percentage specified by the seller (i.e., putting 20% means all\n   listings have their prices increased by 20%).\n * Include an option per product to specify an exact price change rather than\n   using a global percentage modifier.\n * Include an option to override the global pricing modifier if the seller has\n   one or two items that had a drastic price change outside of the global\n   percentage change. It is also helpful if the seller wants to leave most\n   prices and set a percentage change on a few items only.\n\nAlthough this feature is still a work-in-progress subject to changes, this is\nhow the feature is currently being designed. It will help large sellers\nsignificantly reduce the time required to update their prices and better protect\nthem against PART price volatility. This is a temporary solution until a more\nfleshed-out solution is deployed (stable payments, as mentioned in the most\nrecent roadmap [https://particl.news/new-roadmap-2021/]).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Core Development Progress\nParticl Core hasn't been much of a focus this week. Instead, Particl's core\ndeveloper, Tecnovert, has focused on developing a new surprise feature for\nBasicSwap; Particl's upcoming cross-chain and private decentralized exchange\n(DEX).\n\nThis feature hasn't yet been announced, whether publicly or even within the\nclosed beta group, and we're reserving its announcement for when we publish the\nofficial BasicSwap introductory blog post.\n\nSpeaking of which, this introductory blog post is the next major announcement\nscheduled for Particl. Keep an eye out on Particl News for this significant\nannouncement; we'll reveal all the details related to BasicSwap and how we\nintend on making it a crucial aspect of the entire Particl ecosystem.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith the recent milestones we've reached together, namely the release of Particl\nV3 on mainnet, the new roadmap, and the website, and also with the upcoming\nmajor release of the BasicSwap open beta, the project is setting a rock-solid\nfoundation for the future of the internet. And even though, at times, the\njourney Particl has chosen to take may seem arduous and challenging, the rewards\nat the end of it are enormous.\n\nIndeed, far from being a \"for the money\" project, Particl is building the future\nof the digital world and strives to create a safe environment without middlemen;\na world that is all about individual freedoms and putting a stop to the reckless\nmining and abuse of your data. With everything it's doing, Particl is in the\nprocess of restoring the balance of power back to the people and away from\ngreedy corporations and agenda-driven organizations.\n\nThank you all for being a part of this important journey and believing firmly in\nthe project's mission. You are today's pioneers for a better tomorrow!\n\nWe wish you all a wonderful weekend, and we'll see you on Monday!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

Todo ese\nbeneficio se construye a partir de los datos que tu has generado: tu experiencia\npersonal, ya sea en la web o de otro tipo, ya no es tuya porque no es de tu\npropiedad. Algunos argumentan que, debido a la letra pequeña de los términos y\ncondiciones cuando creas cuentas de aplicaciones, todo esto es conocido. Sin\nembargo, ¿aceptaste la casilla que decía que Facebook vendería tus datos a una\nempresa que los utilizaría para interferir en las elecciones de todo el mundo?\nPor supuesto que no, porque esa casilla no era una opción.

Más del 30% de esos vendedores tienen su sede en\nChina y utilizan plataformas de pago como LianLian. Los procesadores de pagos\ntienen acceso directo a la cuenta de un vendedor y, por tanto, pueden recopilar\ntambién los datos de los compradores.

Cuando se produce una filtración, los datos robados, que incluyen los\ndatos bancarios, la dirección del domicilio, los mensajes de texto, los números\nde teléfono, las transacciones, el historial de localización, etc., corren el\nriesgo de ser utilizados en tu contra. A medida que los escándalos en torno a\nlos datos han ido creciendo, también lo ha hecho la presión para que cada uno de\nnosotros sea el legítimo propietario de nuestros datos.\n\n¿Son los mercados descentralizados un camino mejor?\nLa minería de datos se realiza, en general, con la intención específica de\nmejorar la venta de productos. Cuanto más sepan los minoristas sobre lo que tu\nquieres, mejor podrán afinar en ti y convencerte de que gastes. Esta es la razón\npor la que el sector del comercio electrónico se ha volcado en la minería de\ndatos. Gracias a Satoshi y a la cadena de bloques, en los últimos años ha\nsurgido una nueva forma de mercado.\n\n¿Sabías que Satoshi había empezado a trabajar en un mercado descentralizado\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/5253d1ab77fab1995ede03fb934edd67f1359ba8]\n, enteramente construido sobre Bitcoin, antes de desaparecer?\n\nLos mercados descentralizados tienen el mismo aspecto que sus homólogos\ncentralizados, pero pretenden ofrecerte un control total sobre tus datos y, por\ntanto, una privacidad completa. Sin embargo, ¿mejoran realmente el problema que\npretenden solucionar o lo empeoran?\nLos mercados descentralizados que funcionan con cadenas de bloques públicas\npodrían empeorar las cosas. La palabra clave aquí es pública, lo que significa\nque tu valiosa información puede ser rastreada y cosechada por cualquiera con\nacceso a un explorador de bloques. Para complicar la situación, las empresas de\nanálisis de blockchain se han vuelto lo suficientemente sofisticadas como para\nrastrear todo tu historial de transacciones, tu dirección IP y tus datos\npersonales.\n\nLas dudosas startups de análisis de blockchain están siendo compradas en masa\npor bolsas como Coinbase\n[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3bn5e/coinbase-neutrino-former-hacking-team-members?utm_source=reddit.com]\n, mientras que otras se apresuran a realizar rondas de financiación de gran\ncuantía. La minería de datos ya ha demostrado ser extremadamente lucrativa en el\nmundo del comercio electrónico tradicional, y el blockchain ha demostrado ser\ndigno de sustituir a las redes tradicionales. Si se suman dos y dos, la razón de\nla actual fiebre del oro de la analítica de blockchain está más clara que el\nagua. Las empresas de análisis de blockchain de hoy son los centros de\nrecolección de grandes datos de mañana, y los mercados descentralizados sin\nmedidas de privacidad no estarán a salvo.\n\nHacia un mercado descentralizado y privado\nInspirado por los precursores de los mercados descentralizados como OpenBazaar,\nparece que la única respuesta al asalto a nuestra privacidad es llevar el modelo\nde mercado de blockchain un paso más allá y hacerlo privado por defecto. Particl\nMarketplace es un mercado resistente al análisis de la cadena de bloques que es\na la vez descentralizado y privado. Los detalles de tus transacciones y tu\nidentidad se mantienen totalmente anónimos: nadie, por mucho que lo intente,\npuede recopilar tus datos cuando utilizas el mercado.\n\n\nEso significa que tus datos son tuyos: nunca acabarán como escorrentía en un\nturbio silo de datos en algún lugar. Por supuesto, hemos oído a los críticos\nafirmar que si no tienes nada que ocultar, la privacidad no tiene sentido.\nDesgraciadamente, estos argumentos no tienen sentido. Al ocultar tus datos\ncuando compras o vendes en línea, no estás admitiendo implícitamente una\nactividad sospechosa. Estás reclamando el valor inherente a tus datos y\nreforzando tu autonomía digital. En el mundo físico, no soportarías que te\nsiguieran o te robaran, así que ¿por qué dejar que esas cosas le ocurran a tu yo\ndigital?\n\n> \"La privacidad no es algo que se pueda ocultar. La privacidad es algo que hay\nque proteger. Y eso es lo que tú eres. Eso es en lo que crees. Eso es en lo que\nquieres convertirte. La privacidad es el derecho a uno mismo. La privacidad es\nlo que te da la capacidad de compartir con el mundo quién eres en tus propios\ntérminos\". – Edward Snowden\nEn la era digital, la propiedad de los datos es un derecho humano fundamental,\npero necesitamos las herramientas y los recursos para ejercer ese derecho.\nParticl Marketplace es precisamente ese recurso, y al utilizarlo, defiendes no\nsólo tus datos sino también los de tus compañeros.","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/10/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/10/image.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/10/image.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/10/image.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"></figure><p>El mundo es un lugar interconectado, mejor dicho, hiperconectado.

Это означает, что платформа Particl управляется только\nсообществом пользователей, из которых она состоит. Сеть коллективно управляется\nвсеми ее пользователями, и никакие частные лица либо организации не имеют\nкакого-либо определённого контроля над ней.\n\nПанель управления торговой площадкой Торговая площадка Particl Marketplace - это\nпервое децентрализованное приложение, построенное на платформе Particl. Она дает\nвозможность любому человеку, находящемуся в любой точке мира, покупать или\nпродавать какие либо товары и услуги, физические или цифровые, любому другому\nчеловеку независимо от его местонахождения. Поскольку она создана как полностью\nдецентрализованная, то не существует сотрудников или команды поддержки, которые\nмогли бы следить за соблюдением правил. Кроме того, торговая площадка Particl\nполностью конфиденциальна по умолчанию - это значит что нет привязки каких-либо\nидентификационных данных к кому-либо из ее пользователей. Финансовые транзакции\nскрыты в блокчейне, обмен данными зашифрован, все изображения удаляются из\nметаданных, и т.д., и кроме всего это этого вы также можете подключаться к\nторговой площадке через сеть Tor. Если сказать проще - обеспечена  100%-я\nконфиденциальность пользователей торговой площадки.\n\nНежелательный контент\n Однако, всё это также создает некоторую проблему касательно размещаемого\nконтента. На самом деле, а каким образом вы могли бы запретить кому-то покупать\nили продавать что угодно, если нет правил и нет никакой центральной власти с\nособыми полномочиями модерировать контент?  Предоставление определенным\nпользователям особых разрешений/полномочий  удалять контент и поддерживать\nпорядок методом силы и власти- это довольно таки скользкий путь. Постепенно,\nчерез  некоторое время это, скорее всего, в  конечном итоге привело бы к\nвозврату к старым централизованным методам работы, как если бы некая\nцентрализованная компания запустила свою платформу, ввела там свои правила и\nвзимала плату. Но  для Particl такой путь был бы неприемлем. Particl - это\nдецентрализация власти, свобода и конфиденциальность. Многочисленные случаи\nутечки данных и злоупотреблений ими в последние годы,  например постоянные\nскандалы вокруг Facebook, однозначно показали что технологической индустрии\nнеобходимо эволюционировать в направлении защиты своих пользователей.\n[https://particl.news/the-case-for-privacy-in-the-tech-industry-87f625023d4f/]\nКроме того,  поскольку данные стали достаточно ценным, и соответственно -лакомой\nдобычей для хакеров, то мы не можем всерьез расчитывать или доверять\n централизованным моделям хранения данных в вопросах эффективной безопасности и\nзащиты наших данных.\n\n Вот почему тоговая площадка Particl  полностью децентрализована и построена в\nсоответствии с принципами «конфиденциальности на уровне замысла\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_by_design]». Она создана именно так чтобы\nвам просто не нужно было никому доверять для того, чтобы самому вести себя\nчестно. Такой подход гарантирует что никто не получит какие-либо ваши данные\n кроме вашего партнера, с которым вы совершаете сделку. Проще говоря, это\nследующий логичный шаг эволюции в технологии электронной коммерции для защиты\nконфиденциальности своих пользователей. Но, как и любая другая революционная\nтехнология, она также открывает и новые вопросы, требующие решения. Одна из\nтаких задач- как очистить некоторый нишевый рынок  от нежелательных для\nсообщества товаров.\n\nДецентрализованное управление\n Для борьбы с нежелательным контентом Particl Marketplace использует полностью\nдецентрализованный и прозрачно справедливый механизм управления - каждый может\nпроголосовать против нежелательных товаров.\n\nКак отметить нежелательные товары / видеоКоротко:\n * Соотношение силы голоса: 1 монета PART = 1 голос\n * Порог для удаления, на момент публикации: -9,000 PART (может изменяться)\n * Ваши монеты не блокируются для голосования\n * Комиссия за пометку товара: менее 0.001 PART для первого, кто пометил\n   товар(как нежелательный) и бесплатно для всех последующих.\n\nПорог для удаления\n Чтобы проголосовать против определенного товара, пользователи должны пометить\nего, используя специальную кнопку \"Flag\"  интерфейса Particl Marketplace. После\nтого, как кто-то в первый раз помечает товар как нежелательный  - он помещается\nв очередь всех ранее помеченных товаров. Затем другие пользователи могут либо\nсогласиться с тем, что его следует удалить с торговой площадки, либо не\nсогласиться и проголосовать за то, чтобы он остался. Чтобы товар был полностью\nудален, сумма голосов негативных голосов должна достичь определенного\nотрицательного порога (на данный момент это -9000 голосов).Такая\nдецентрализованная система модерации на Particl Marketplace похожа, например, на\nсистему голосования Reddit за/против(upvote/downvote). На Reddit это работает\nтак: если, например, 5 пользователей проголосуют против публикации и 3\nпользователя проголосуют за нее, то у публикации будет итоговая оценка -2. Если\nже она достигнет определенного отрицательного порога (например, -10), то пост\n автоматически скрывается от других пользователей. Reddit считает голоса по\nпринципу: 1 пользователь = 1 голос.\n\nКак проголосовать за удаление товара\nСистема модерации публикаций на Particl Marketplace идентична этому. Каждый\nпользователь, голосуя за или против помеченного товара, вносит свой вклад в\nувеличение или уменьшение итоговой оценки этого товара. Причем, голосование\nпротив товара также скрывает его в личной копии клиентского ПО проголосовавшего\nпользователя (скрывается только у него, но а не скрывается для всех пока оценка\nне достигнет порога удаления).      Из-за своей конфиденциальности по замыслу и\nдецентрализованного характера Particl Marketplace не имеет  реального способа\nобнаружить пользователей с мульти-аккаунтами, заблокировать учетную запись, либо\nзаблокировать  IP-адрес, или вручную отфильтровать голоса, чтобы удалить\nфальшивые таким образом, и т.д. То есть, если бы система голосования\n основывалась на таких параметрах, то она была бы стать легко фальсифицируемой.\nПоэтому вместо всего этого Particl считает голоса как 1 монета = 1 голосу, что\nделает невозможными все подобные игры с системой. Не имеет значения сколько\nкошельков вы используете или сколько раз вы пытаетесь менять свой IP-адрес - при\nподсчете голосов система учитывает только ваш «вес монет». Это гарантирует, что\nвлиять на результаты голосования могут  только те, кто имеет реальную долю монет\nв сети. Порог удаления для открытой торговой площадки Particl будет -9000 на\nвремя первой версии основной сети. В дальнейшем, по мере развития платформы,\nэтот порог может и будет корректироваться, и для определения оптимального\nзначения может потребоваться несколько таких коррекций.  Потому что теорию игры \nневозможно было полноценно проверить в тестовой сети (т.к. тестовые монеты не\nимеют никакой ценности),  это можно будет сделать только  в реальных условиях\nработы.\n\nТеория игры\n Как вы наверное уже поняли, этот механизм на самом деле предельно прост, но при\nэтом он достаточно мощный и эффективный. Так как в его основу положен один\nаспект теории игр в целом: пользователю необходимо приобрести много монет чтобы\nиметь значительную силу голоса и таким образом существенно влиять на исход\nголосования. Это может быть довольно дорогим удовольствием в зависимости от\nактивного порогового значения для удаления (в первой версии торговой площадки\nдля основной сети этот порог будет -9000), и дальше это будет только дорожать по\nмере получения платформой большего сетевого эффекта. Например, представьте что\nплохой парень с 9999 PART попытается удалить(не объективно, а  по личным\nсоображениям, и т.п.) какой-то товар. Но затем один хороший парень с 1000 PART\nсможет предотвратить это удаление. Плохому парню с 19999 PART могут\nпротивостоять 11 хороших парней с 1000 PART каждый, и так далее.        \nГолосующие сильно мотивированы вести себя корректно, так как они имеют прямую\nфинансовую долю в сети.  Если голосующие, например,  вступят в сговор друг с\nдругом и начнут троллить либо подвергать необъективной цензуре торговую\nплощадку, то это, скорее всего, снизит стоимость сети в целом и, таким образом,\nэто принесет лишь чистые убытки всем заговорщикам.    Если пользователи торговой\nплощадки не будут активно помогать в управлении сообществом, то это может\nпривести к заполнению площадки нежелательным либо спамерским контентом. Такое\nбудет отталкивать людей и может серьезно снизить потенциальный сетевой эффект,\nсоздав серьезное препятствие для привлечения более широкой аудитории к\nиспользованю Particl Marketplace.                                              \n             Фактически все пользователи Particl Marketplace имеют финансовую\nдолю в сети, поэтому любые действия, отталкивающие пользователей от Particl\nMarketplace, работают  против их собственных интересов. Большее количество\n пользователей на торговой площадке означает больше потенциальных покупателей\nдля продавцов и больше товаров  для покупателей. Поэтому участие в  управлению\nсообществом - это небольшой, но очень важный вклад, который каждый пользователь\nможет сделать для  Particl . \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nВопросы - ответы\n * Какой порог для удаления?\n * Порог для удаления в настоящее время по умолчанию составляет -9000, для\n   первой версии Particl Marketplace в основной сети. Этот порог можно настроить\n   для своей локальной копии приложения. Если, например, вы установите у себя\n   порог  -19000, то товары будут удалятся у вас только когда они дойдут до\n   -19000 голосов.\n\n--\n\n * Исчезнет ли товар после того как я проголосую против?\n * Товар удаляется из вашего личного экземпляра приложения торговой площадки как\n   только он достигает порога удаления, настроенного вами (-9000 по умолчанию).\n   Товар удалится отовсюду только после того, как он достигает порога удаления,\n   индивидуально настроенного в каждой копии приложения (-9000 по умолчанию).\n\n--\n\n * Нужен ли мне стейкинг чтобы голосовать?\n * Нет, не нужно помещать монеты в стейкинг. Голосовать может любой, имеющий\n   монеты на балансе.\n\n--\n\n * Могу ли я головать если мои монеты хранятся на аппаратном кошельке?\n * В настоящее время нет, но поддержка аппаратных кошельков планируется в\n   будущем.\n\n--\n\n * Есть ли комиссия за пометку товара?\n * Если вы первый пользователь, помечающий объявление, которое ещё не было\n   помечено ранее, то с вас будет взиматься символическая плата (0.00x PART или\n   менее). Если вы помечаете товар, который уже был кем-то помечен ранее -\n   комиссия не взимается.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl - это участие\nМы хотим быть узнаваемыми везде, и с вашей помощью мы станем более заметными.\nДля вас это занимает секунды - подписаться на наши каналы и нажать на иконку\nколокольчика.\n\nYouTube [https://youtube.com/c/particl] Twitter\n[https://twitter.com/Particl_RU/] Mastodon [https://fosstodon.org/@particl] \nReddit [https://reddit.com/r/particl]\n\n\nПрисоединяйтесь к нашим чатам для живого общения.

Одна из таких задач- как очистить некоторый нишевый рынок  от нежелательных для сообщества товаров.</p><h3 id=\"--1\">Децентрализованное управление</h3><p> Для борьбы с нежелательным контентом Particl Marketplace использует полностью децентрализованный и прозрачно справедливый механизм управления - каждый может проголосовать против нежелательных товаров.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UuzlB82evHc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><figcaption>Как отметить нежелательные товары / видео</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"--2\">Коротко:</h3><ul><li><strong>Соотношение силы голоса:</strong> 1 монета PART = 1 голос</li><li><strong>Порог для удаления, на момент публикации:</strong> -9,000 PART (может изменяться)</li><li>Ваши <strong>монеты не блокируются</strong> для голосования</li><li><strong>Комиссия за пометку товара:</strong> менее 0.001 PART для первого, кто пометил товар(как нежелательный) и бесплатно для всех последующих.</li></ul><h3 id=\"--3\">Порог для удаления</h3><p> Чтобы проголосовать против определенного товара, пользователи должны пометить его, используя специальную кнопку \"Flag\"  интерфейса Particl Marketplace. После того, как кто-то в первый раз помечает товар как нежелательный  - он помещается в очередь всех ранее помеченных товаров. Затем другие пользователи могут либо согласиться с тем, что его следует удалить с торговой площадки, либо не согласиться и проголосовать за то, чтобы он остался. Чтобы товар был полностью удален, сумма голосов негативных голосов должна достичь определенного отрицательного порога (на данный момент это -9000 голосов).Такая децентрализованная система модерации на Particl Marketplace похожа, например, на систему голосования Reddit за/против(upvote/downvote). На Reddit это работает так: если, например, 5 пользователей проголосуют против публикации и 3 пользователя проголосуют за нее, то у публикации будет итоговая оценка -2. Если же она достигнет определенного отрицательного порога (например, -10), то пост  автоматически скрывается от других пользователей. <strong>Reddit считает голоса по принципу: 1 пользователь = 1 голос.</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/2880/1*4oviqSSL0DeUDYK6vFHdhg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Как проголосовать за удаление товара</figcaption></figure><p><br> Система модерации публикаций на Particl Marketplace идентична этому. Каждый пользователь, голосуя за или против помеченного товара, вносит свой вклад в увеличение или уменьшение итоговой оценки этого товара. Причем, голосование против товара также скрывает его в личной копии клиентского ПО проголосовавшего пользователя (скрывается только у него, но а не скрывается для всех пока оценка не достигнет порога удаления).      Из-за своей конфиденциальности по замыслу и децентрализованного характера Particl Marketplace не имеет  реального способа обнаружить пользователей с мульти-аккаунтами, заблокировать учетную запись, либо заблокировать  IP-адрес, или вручную отфильтровать голоса, чтобы удалить фальшивые таким образом, и т.д. То есть, если бы система голосования  основывалась на таких параметрах, то она была бы стать легко фальсифицируемой. Поэтому вместо всего этого <strong>Particl считает голоса как 1 монета = 1 голосу</strong>, что делает невозможными все подобные игры с системой. Не имеет значения сколько кошельков вы используете или сколько раз вы пытаетесь менять свой IP-адрес - при подсчете голосов система учитывает только ваш «вес монет». Это гарантирует, что влиять на результаты голосования могут  только те, кто имеет реальную долю монет в сети.<strong> Порог удаления для открытой торговой площадки Particl будет -9000</strong> на время первой версии основной сети. В дальнейшем, по мере развития платформы, этот порог может и будет корректироваться, и для определения оптимального значения может потребоваться несколько таких коррекций.  Потому что <strong>теорию игры</strong> невозможно было полноценно проверить в тестовой сети (т.к. тестовые монеты не имеют никакой ценности),  это можно будет сделать только  в реальных условиях работы.</p><h3 id=\"--4\">Теория игры</h3><p> Как вы наверное уже поняли, этот механизм на самом деле предельно прост, но при этом он достаточно мощный и эффективный. Так как в его основу положен один аспект <strong>теории игр</strong> в целом: пользователю необходимо приобрести много монет чтобы иметь значительную силу голоса и таким образом существенно влиять на исход голосования. Это может быть довольно дорогим удовольствием в зависимости от активного порогового значения для удаления (в первой версии торговой площадки для основной сети этот <strong>порог будет -9000</strong>), и дальше это будет только дорожать по мере получения платформой большего сетевого эффекта. Например, представьте что плохой парень с 9999 PART попытается удалить(не объективно, а  по личным соображениям, и т.п.) какой-то товар. Но затем один хороший парень с 1000 PART сможет предотвратить это удаление. Плохому парню с 19999 PART могут противостоять 11 хороших парней с 1000 PART каждый, и так далее.         Голосующие сильно мотивированы вести себя корректно, так как они имеют прямую финансовую долю в сети.  Если голосующие, например,  вступят в сговор друг с другом и начнут троллить либо подвергать необъективной цензуре торговую площадку, то это, скорее всего, снизит стоимость сети в целом и, таким образом, это принесет лишь чистые убытки всем заговорщикам.    Если пользователи торговой площадки не будут активно помогать в управлении сообществом, то это может привести к заполнению площадки нежелательным либо спамерским контентом. Такое будет отталкивать людей и может серьезно снизить потенциальный сетевой эффект, создав серьезное препятствие для привлечения более широкой аудитории к использованю Particl Marketplace.                                                            Фактически все пользователи Particl Marketplace имеют финансовую долю в сети, поэтому любые действия, отталкивающие пользователей от Particl Marketplace, работают  против их собственных интересов. Большее количество  пользователей на торговой площадке означает больше потенциальных покупателей для продавцов и больше товаров  для покупателей. Поэтому участие в  управлению сообществом - это небольшой, но очень важный вклад, который каждый пользователь может сделать для  Particl . </p><hr><h3 id=\"--5\">Вопросы - ответы</h3><ul><li><strong>Какой порог для удаления?</strong></li><li>Порог для удаления в настоящее время по умолчанию составляет -9000, для первой версии Particl Marketplace в основной сети.

Плохому парню с 19999 PART могут противостоять 11 хороших парней с 1000 PART каждый, и так далее.         Голосующие сильно мотивированы вести себя корректно, так как они имеют прямую финансовую долю в сети.  Если голосующие, например,  вступят в сговор друг с другом и начнут троллить либо подвергать необъективной цензуре торговую площадку, то это, скорее всего, снизит стоимость сети в целом и, таким образом, это принесет лишь чистые убытки всем заговорщикам.    Если пользователи торговой площадки не будут активно помогать в управлении сообществом, то это может привести к заполнению площадки нежелательным либо спамерским контентом. Такое будет отталкивать людей и может серьезно снизить потенциальный сетевой эффект, создав серьезное препятствие для привлечения более широкой аудитории к использованю Particl Marketplace.                                                            Фактически все пользователи Particl Marketplace имеют финансовую долю в сети, поэтому любые действия, отталкивающие пользователей от Particl Marketplace, работают  против их собственных интересов. Большее количество  пользователей на торговой площадке означает больше потенциальных покупателей для продавцов и больше товаров  для покупателей.

The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News.
