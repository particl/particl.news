The fixes\nwill be implemented in a 3.3.1 release soon.\n\nOther than that, we are pleased to report that the launch has been successful\nand without any major issues. This indicates that we are ready to start\ndevelopment on the standalone seller app.\n\nMarketplace Seller App ✅\nWith Particl Desktop 3.3 now available on mainnet, we are beginning to develop\nthe standalone seller app, an essential component of our renewed vision for the\nmarketplace dApp. This app will serve a variety of purposes in the ecosystem,\nand become a major factor as we move forward.\n\nIts functions can be divided into three distinct categories:\n\nRemote Services Management: This suite of capabilities provides the means to\nmanage connections to external services such as WooCommerce, inventory\nmanagement systems, and liquidity providers.\n\nThe Particl Seller App is designed to integrate external services, essentially\ngranting sellers access to the ever-expanding range of eCommerce technology,\nplatforms, and plugins, and ultimately allowing them to leverage their\nadvantages when using Particl marketplace.\n\nInventory and Listing Management: This category deals with anything Particl\ninventory and listing related. This include the management of listing data,\nprices, and publishing methodology, among other functions.\n\nNotably, the app will enable sellers to automatically republish listings on\nParticl Marketplace after expiration and to adjust PART prices in accordance\nwith current coin value. This will significantly improve the seller experience\nand minimize the time needed to manage and maintain Particl listings.\n\nMarketplace Activities: This category encompasses all activities related to the\nmarketplace, including order management, customer communication, escrow\nprogression, and more.\n\nOverall, this app will provide sellers with all the necessary functions to\noperate a business on Particl without needing to download Particl Desktop.\nAdditionally, its external connection capabilities will make it easier to draw\nin sellers who are already active on other eCommerce platforms, making it\neasier-than-ever to integrate Particl Marketplace into their business flow and\nleverage its benefits, without as many of its convenience drawbacks.\n\nOver time, many of these features will be incorporated into the new desktop\nclient, which will be substantially improved during the new development cycle,\nas well as future versions of the marketplace including web and mobile versions.\nHowever, this standalone application will expedite the process of bringing these\nmuch-needed features to life, allowing the team to more rapidly begin work on a\nmobile/web version of the marketplace that focuses on buyers; the ultimate goal\nbeing to cater to both buyers and sellers' needs as fast as possible for\nadoption purposes.\n\nBe sure to look out for an upcoming blog post on the Particl Seller App and our\nstrategy and rationale behind it on Particl News!\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core.

It will enable sellers to create, manage, and\npublish listings, but also set up escrow rates, and manage shipping, orders, and\nchats. We also plan to add plenty of automation into the system — such as the\nauto-relisting of items, automated pricing updates, and auto-acceptance of\norders within specified parameters — to make selling on the marketplace more\nefficient and effortless.\n\nThe application will also allow sellers to connect their Particl inventory to\nexternal platforms, such as WooCommerce, to benefit from its multitude of\nfunctionality and flexible plugins.

You can refer to the\nlist below as a reminder of what we're working on:\n\n * Integrating the new subfee feature to make coin withdrawals and offer posting\n   easier (no need to manually calculate fees) into the GUI.\n * Addition of a dark mode.\n * Addition of a \"simple\" mode for the GUI in which the user interface is\n   slimmed down. This aims at simplifying the user experience but still allowing\n   for more advanced options via a \"simple/advanced\" toggler.\n * Addition of a new price charting system. The current chart style will still\n   be available and it'll be possible to select which one you want to use via\n   the settings page.\n * Introduction of a wide variety of GUI improvements, tweaks, and changes based\n   on feedback from our beta testers.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

So let's quickly see what progress has been made in the past\nfew days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nThis week, we have completed the integration of all marketplace-related changes\ninto Particl Desktop. That means we're now at the final item before we can push\nParticl Desktop 3.3 on testnet, which is to proceed through a series of minor\ntweaks and improvements to the desktop client.\n\nOnce completed, we'll run a series of internal tests and then deploy the build\non testnet for a few days before launching on mainnet, hopefully before\nChristmas time! ?\n\nRemaining Items for Particl Desktop 3.3\n 1. (In progress) A couple of general but minor tweaks and minor\n    improvements/optimizations need to be done, but they are negligible in terms\n    of effort to sort out.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As usual, we've been\nkeeping up with upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain\nParticl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. You can always keep track\nof those changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nAdded Shamir39 Protocol Into Core ?\nrpc: Add splitmnemonic and combinemnemonic · particl/particl-core@4eb2269\nCompatible with:https://iancoleman.io/shamir39/GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commit/4eb22699652221c3c1ac91ac77596bbcf18dc599]\nOver the past few days, we've added the Shamir39 protocol\n[https://github.com/iancoleman/shamir39] into Particl Core, which allows for\nsplitting a mnemonic into different parts for sharing with other parties safely.\n\n> BIP39 Mnemonics are a simple way to back up an entire wallet.

So let's quickly see what progress has been made in the past\nfew days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nWe are still working on the three outstanding items we mentioned in last week's\nprogress report. While there have yet to be completed items, we've been making\nsteady progress on our way to the testnet release of Particl Desktop 3.3.\n\nFor context, here are the three outstanding items:\n\n 1. We still need to complete the integration of the new wallet-specific\n    settings. This ongoing item has been taking a bit longer than anticipated\n    due to more significant and forward-compatible changes to the settings\n    structure — making for a perfect segue into Particl's upcoming major\n    development cycle\n    [https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/].\n 2. Once that's done, we must re-add the new marketplace-specific code into\n    Particl Desktop. This is relatively trivial since most of the new code\n    relates to ensuring that the desktop client passes the correct startup\n    parameters to the market service. In other words, there is very little\n    interaction that the marketplace UI does with the rest of the system.\n 3. And then, a couple of tweaks and minor improvements/optimizations need to be\n    done, but they are negligible in terms of effort to sort out.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As usual, we've been\nkeeping up with upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain\nParticl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version.

These have now been promptly resolved!\n * We've also identified a few edge cases where issues could arise under\n   specific conditions. These issues are minor in nature, and none of them could\n   have led to a loss of funds or other similar critical consequences! Those are\n   typically quick fixes, and so we're fixing them as they come.\n * The v0.1.1 version of the BasicSwap GUI is nearly ready and should be live\n   for closed beta testing over the weekend or early next week. This GUI update\n   takes into account many comments, feedback, and user experience improvement\n   suggestions gathered from our testers. Thanks to all testers involved; your\n   help is invaluable!\n * We've dropped the TradingView chart to favour a locally built chart. While it\n   still uses third-party APIs to gather data about coin prices, the graph is\n   now much more stable and useful in the context of BasicSwap's native order\n   book system. Note that the API used is user-configurable and can be turned\n   off, if desired.\n * In the future, we also want to support the historical price chart with a \n   native depth chart based on offers placed on BasicSwap's own order books.\n   This is, however, not planned for the first phase of the public open beta.\n\nAs we continue testing and improving BasicSwap on a daily basis, we are rapidly\ngetting closer to the public launch of the open beta. \n\nWe will keep you up-to-date regarding the testing progress following the testing\nrelease of BasicSwap's v0.1.1 GUI and, on next week's progress report, should\nhave a much better idea of when BasicSwap will be able to jump into the open\nbeta phase!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

So let's quickly see what progress has been made in the past\nfew days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nWe've been making good progress on integrating the now-completed changes planned\nfor 3.3 into the desktop client. While the work continues, it is now progressing\nat a steady pace.\n\nNew \"Core\" section redirects to the newly-added Core-related settings (UI/UX is\na WIP)Now for a bit more information on the screenshot above.\n\n 1. Clicking on the \"Core\" button brings up the core configuration screen,\n    allowing the user to change various core-related settings. Things like\n    connection details (URL, whether to use the core cookie file for\n    authentication or provided RPC user/password, etc.), whether to start core\n    on PD startup or not, which network to connect to (mainnet, testnet, or\n    regtest), proxy details (i.e., Tor), etc. Those are generally saved in an\n    app-specific (wallet, market, etc.) JSON file, meaning that one can script\n    the download, configuration, and startup of Particl Desktop for specific\n    environments such as Whonix, for example.\n 2. In the screenshot, the core status message below the buttons shows that core\n    is connected. If core was not already connected, then the other buttons\n    would not be active. In other words, one cannot open the marketplace unless\n    core is actively running.\n 3. A new icon in the sidebar allows the user to navigate back to the welcome\n    screen from anywhere. Currently, it looks like a hamburger menu icon, but\n    we'll change it to a more comprehensible icon before the release.\n\nWhile the back-end changes are now complete, integrating them into the user\ninterface is our current main and final desktop-related deliverable before we\ncan go live with PD 3.3. Of course, as is always the case with larger releases,\nwe'll run a testnet round before the mainnet deployment.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As usual, we've been\nkeeping up with upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain\nParticl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version.

So far, this\nclosed beta round has been incredibly fruitful and productive; we're delighted\nwith it and excited to release BasicSwap's open beta publicly soon.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

We'd like to implement a couple of extra minor items, such as\nlogging outputs from the front end to the Particl Desktop log file, but we will\nprioritize other more pressing deliverables first. In any case, we expect it to\nbe pretty simple and straightforward to implement when needed.\n\nFor now, we're in the process of re-evaluating some changes on the front end to\nintegrate these new changes neatly in a user-friendly way. Although that is not\nexpected to be a challenging task, it is relatively tedious as we now need to\nremove a wide variety of long-standing implementations to the GUI that we've\ncarried for several desktop versions. That means updating everything that\ndepends on those changes and then potentially updating any code that depends on\nthat functionality, and so on.\n\nSo, generally speaking, everything is continuing along and seeing steady\nprogress.

This marks an important milestone for the project as this funds the team\nto develop, promote, and expand the Particl ecosystem for a duration of 12 more\nmonths, after which the team will submit a renewed funding request.\n\nFor a summary of the team's now-approved proposal and what we will be working on\nin the next year, please check out the original proposal blog post\n[https://particl.news/team-funding-proposal-3/] as well as the massive\nannouncement regarding Particl's upcoming evolutionary leap forward\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/].\n\nTeam Funding Proposal #3Learn all the details about the Particl team’s third\nfunding request from the Treasury Fund.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/team-funding-proposal-3/]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Results Are In!\nTeam Funding Request 3\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/team-funding-request-3.html]The Team Funding\nRequest #3 proposed attributing funds from the network's decentralized Treasury\nFund to the Particl team to support the development, promotion, and expansion of\nthe Particl ecosystem. The proposal requested 35,250 PART per month from the\ntreasury for 12 months, after which a new funding request will need to be pushed\nby the team and approved by stakeholders.\n\nWe are happy to report that Particl stakeholders have approved this proposal \nwith an outstanding 99.26% approval rate (minimum required was 60%) and a 51.53%\nparticipation rate (minimum required was 20%). The vote lasted for 5,040 blocks,\nwith 2,578 of them voting in favor of the proposal and 19 voting against it.\n\nThank You For Your Trust\nPassing funding requests isn't possible without your trust and support. Indeed,\nbecause the community entirely owns the Treasury Fund, this proposal asked for\nmuch more than just funds to support the project; it asked for the your trust\nand a stamp of approval as we embark in a new major development cycle\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/].\n\nFor this reason, we want to thank every one of you in the community for this\nvote of confidence and for participating in this democratic exercise.

Although the scope of the\nissue's impact is limited, it did knock certain nodes, including one staking\npool [https://particl.page/articles/pool-shutdown/], off of the network\nmomentarily.\n\nNew Particl Core Releases AvailableNew Particl Core releases have been\ndeployed,\nfixing a rare staking bug that occurred over the past few days.Particl News\ncryptoguard [https://particl.news/new-core-releases-staking-patch/]Due to this,\naffected staking nodes have been unable to vote for a short moment, which may\nhave led to a slightly lower participation rate compared to what we typically\nsee. Regardless, the proposal was still overwhelmingly approved, and its\nparticipation rate has been well over the required threshold of 20%.\n\n> Note: The Particl.page pool [https://particl.page/pool/] operator had previously\nannounced they were shutting down their staking pool as a result of an\nunfortunate series of events on their end while resolving the staking node\nissue, but later communicated that they were working on a potential solution\nthat would allow them to remain online. Please check out their blog\n[https://particl.page/articles/] [https://particl.page/articles/] to follow the\nnews and stay up-to-date regarding their recovery process. \n\nNote that no funds were lost or compromised, as per the secure nature of cold\nstaking.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

So let's quickly see what progress has been made in the past\nfew days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop\nAs has been the case for the past few updates, we're still working through\nincrementally separating Particl Core from Particl Desktop and, by the same\nprocess, adding more user configuration options to the desktop client.\n\nAs we've mentioned in previous progress reports, this is a large but essential\nstep as we move ahead with Particl's upcoming development cycle\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/] which transforms\nthe ecosystem's architecture with a modular approach.\n\nParticl Core\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As usual, we've been\nkeeping up with upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain\nParticl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. You can always keep track\nof those changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nInvestigating a Node Issue ?\nEarlier today, we observed some cases of staking nodes getting stuck at a\nprevious block and not staking anymore. We are currently investigating the\nissue, but in the meantime, please check your node(s) to ensure that they are\n(1) staking correctly and (2) on the latest block (you can verify the current\nblock number here [https://explorer.particl.io/] or directly using Partyman's \npartyman/partyman status command.\n\nIf your node appears out of sync, you can fix the problem by simply restarting\nit. On Partyman, you can do this by typing partyman/partyman restart. If you're\nusing Particl Qt or Particl Desktop, close the application completely and\nre-open it.\n\n> Note: After restarting, make sure that your node successfully syncs to the\nlatest block. In rare cases, it may take a couple of restarts for this to\nhappen.\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week, we've completed the important process of building a standardized way\nto integrate certain Bitcoin-based cryptocurrencies into BasicSwap. However, we\nhaven't tested the entire process on mainnet yet, which we'll be doing over the\ncourse of next week.\n\nOnce ready, it'll make it much easier and faster to integrate various\ncryptocurrencies that meet certain criteria for cross-chain swapping. This will\nhelp the Particl team work through integrations faster and let other projects\nbuild their own coin integrations.\n\nBasicSwap Front-end ?\nWe've also been making steady progress on the finalization and testing of\nBasicSwap's GUI in preparation for the open beta launch. Here's a summary of\nwhat we've completed, fixed, or improved to the user interface this week.\n\n 1. Updated the error/confirm modals\n 2. Finished most templates for the order book tables\n 3. Tested the GUI across multiple browsers\n 4. Added a \"mobile-friendly\" menu for small resolution screens and mobile\n    devices (requires browsing to the IP address of your local BasicSwap\n    instance for now) \n 5. Improved some parts of the https_server\n 6. Wrapped up the intro page\n 7. Fixed a variety of bugs and issues with the user interface\n\nVote for Team Proposal Ongoing ?\nTeam Funding Proposal #3Learn all the details about the Particl team’s third\nfunding request from the Treasury Fund.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/team-funding-proposal-3/]This Wednesday, the voting round\nfor the Particl team's 3rd funding proposal\n[https://particl.news/team-funding-proposal-3/] has started and is currently\nongoing.

So let's quickly see what progress has been made in the past\nfew days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nAs has been the case for the past few updates, we're still working through\nincrementally separating Particl Core from Particl Desktop and, by the same\nprocess, adding more user configuration options to the desktop client. \n\nAs we've mentioned in previous progress reports, this is a large but essential\nstep as we move ahead with Particl's upcoming development cycle\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/] which transforms\nthe ecosystem's architecture with a modular approach.\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Update\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As usual, we've been\nkeeping up with upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain\nParticl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. You can always keep track\nof those changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week, we've been exploring the integration of certain coins on BasicSwap.\nWe're working on preparing example commits showing other projects which may want\nto integrate their coins onto BasicSwap how to do it themselves. However,\nBasicSwap's true cross-chain nature makes it impossible to have a\none-size-fits-all coin integration solution. Still, the example commits we're\nworking on will nonetheless be able to facilitate the integration process of a\ndecent number of coins.\n\nAdditionally, we've made significant progress on the DEX's GUI. We're currently\nworking through a few issues and adding improvements as we test it before\nreleasing publicly. But, just as a small end-of-week teaser, here is what the\ncurrent order book page looks like!\n\nListing Seeding Proposal Progress Update\nIt seems like we're long overdue for an update on the listing seeding proposal!\nAs it stands right now, we've got two short-term priorities related to Particl\nDesktop and the marketplace:\n\n * Completing the Particl Desktop 3.3 changes and releasing it\n * Deploying the listing seeding system\n\nAnd while we're currently primarily focused on the changes related to Particl\nDesktop 3.3, we've already begun working on the listing seeding proposal's\ndeliverable, notably by adding product codes in the last Particl Desktop update,\nwhich is a requirement for an improved, more complete vision we have for this\nproposal. But what is this \"improved vision\"?\n\nListing Seeding Proposal 2.0\nSince we've published the original listing seeding proposal, many things have\nchanged around the Particl project, especially considering last week's major\nannouncement of an evolutionary leap forward for the ecosystem\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/].\n\nFor this reason, we've re-imagined what we intend to deliver for the proposal so\nthat it fits better with this new direction and have designed a more complete\nand open system that will drastically improve the life of Particl sellers — not\njust populate the marketplace with listings.\n\nAs opposed to building a relatively closed system for the exclusive purpose of\nseeding listings on the marketplace, we're now opting to build an open \"power\nseller\" standalone application intended to be released publicly.\n\nThis system will act as an external, advanced inventory and order management\ntool built for power Particl sellers. This will open up a ton of opportunities\nfor sellers by giving them access to more advanced capabilities.

That way, there is no requirement to wait for the full version of\nthe improved marketplace to be ready before we can start releasing new products.\n\nIndeed, because the first few versions of the upcoming mobile version of the\nmarketplace will be exclusively buyer-focused, sellers still need to be able to\npublish listings for buyers to buy. And since listings posted on the current\nversion of the marketplace won't show up on the new version (because the\ncodebases will be vastly different), there needs to be a way for sellers to\npublish listings while we build the full version of the marketplace.\n\nAnd that's where the listing seeding tool comes in handy. It will let sellers\nsell their products and services on the new version of the marketplace while we\nincrementally build the full version (on desktop and web). In other words, we'll\nuse this tool as an intermediary for sellers, allowing us to deploy the\nbuyer-focused mobile version of the marketplace more quickly and keep things\nmoving smoothly.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
