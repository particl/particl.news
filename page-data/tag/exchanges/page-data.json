The xmrswap protocol\nis based on the work of Joël Gugger (h4sh3d [https://github.com/h4sh3d]) from\nthe Monero community. You can read Joël’s extensive whitepaper by following \nthis\nlink\n[https://github.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap/blob/master/whitepaper/xmr-btc.pdf]\n.\n\nTo make a Monero to Particl (or the other way around) atomic swap on mainnet,\nyou’ll first need to find another peer that also wants to do a swap, agree on\nswap parameters (how many Coin A for how many Coin B), and then simply follow\nthese step-by-step instructions here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/demo.md].\n\n * Step-by-step guide on how to make a XMR — PART atomic swap\n   [https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/demo.md]\n\n> Note: xmrswap is a fully-functioning Proof-of-Concept for a protocol that allows\nswapping Monero to Particl without any third-party at all. It is only available\nin CLI (command-line interface) for the moment.Although the protocol is safe and\nhas been tested extensively, it should still be considered as experimental\nsoftware. Its usage is reserved for advanced users only and no immediate support\nwill be provided from the Particl team or Tecnovert.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s an Atomic Swap\nIf you’re unfamiliar with the term, an “atomic swap” is a special type of \ncross-chain exchange that allows two parties that don’t know each other to\nexchange a currency for another without involving a third-party like an exchange\nor escrow service provider. The process is entirely trustless, meaning that you\ndon’t need to trust the other party to know for certain you won’t get scammed.\nThe integrity of each swap is guaranteed by cryptography.\n\nIn the specific case of this blog post, the “atomic swap” refers to the process\nof safely exchanging Monero for Particl, or Particl for Monero, without the help\nof any third-party.\n\nMonero and Particl Atomic Swap Use Cases\nAlthough this Proof-of-Concept is still only available as a command-line tool\nand reserved for advanced users only, it sets the foundation for future and\ndeeper integrations into the Particl ecosystem. Here are just some of the\nuse-cases the xmrswap protocol enables.\n\nShop online using XMR\nMonero is the world’s most private cryptocurrency. Particl has the world’s most\nprivate marketplace. Both are unstoppable. Then why not combine them and get the\nworld’s most private, unstoppable eCommerce ecosystem?\n\nThe xmrswap protocol can be integrated in such a way that lets you easily swap\nXMR for PART to privately buy anything on the Particl Marketplace without\nleaving any digital footprint. This same integration can be applied to easily\ncash out marketplace sales revenue into Monero and get that extra privacy layer\nwhen leaving the Particl ecosystem.\n\nIncreases Particl’s resiliency\nAdding a more user-friendly interface that easily allows to swap Monero, and\nother cryptocurrencies, for Particl will also increase Particl’s resiliency and\nmake it unstoppable.\n\nThat’s because atomic swaps, other than simply being great tools for privacy,\nsecurity, decentralization, and freedom, also act as a solid fallback solution\nin case of exchange delisting, geographical bans, and other types of restrictive\nmeasures. It reduces the overall influence some third-parties may have over the\nnetwork and allows it to be accessible in perpetuity.\n\nPrivately acquire PART\nA deeper integration into Particl Desktop would allow you to privately acquire\nPART straight from the Particl wallet and without having to forfeit your data to\nanyone, including exchanges, ISPs, and etc.\n\nThis is a particularly strong use-case if you take your privacy seriously as it\nnot only protects your personal information when using the marketplace, but also\nbefore and after using it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Next?\nIntegration of the xmrswapprotocol into Particl Desktop is an entirely separate\ntask and requires other Particl developers other than just Tecnovert to get\ninvolved. As they are currently busy with the Particl V3 release as well as\nother tasks, it is currently not possible to estimate when it will be ready.\n\nThere is, however, some mock ups in the works of how an xmrswap integration may\nlook like in Particl Desktop. Here’s one!\n\nTake note that this mock up is purely a work-in-progress and would most\ndefinitely look a bit different when it’ll be ready for release. It does,\nhowever, gives a good visual representation of how it may look like.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis news announcement is only part of some more major announcements coming\nsoon. Yes, it’s been a long road to the launch of V3, but it’s given the time\nfor the Particl team to prepare very exciting stuff for the “after-V3” era.\n\nStay tuned, the best is yet to come!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Monero-and-Particl-Atomic-Swaps/1-lx6zvR-f6pN7G9RmKx9otw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"swap-part-and-xmr-on-mainnet-without-any-3rd-party-\">Swap PART and XMR on Mainnet Without Any 3rd Party ?</h3><p>As we head towards the long-awaited <a href=\"https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813\"><strong>Particl V3 release</strong></a>, the Particl developers have been wrapping up the last few pieces required for its launch.</p><p>Particl V3 is Particl’s biggest update to date and it introduces a brand new desktop application as well as greatly improved marketplace experience.

Check out the link below to know everything about the massive\nParticl V3.0 update.\n\nStepping Things Up Again With Particl Desktop 3.0\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\nA New Breakthrough for Privacy and eCommerce ?particl.news\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nImproved Swap Engine Coming on V3 Release\nOne of the main components that’s getting a big makeover with the Particl V3\nrelease is the in-app swap engine. This module, which is available right inside\nthe Particl Desktop application, lets you easily swap other cryptocurrencies for\nPART so that you can anonymously buy or sell anything on the marketplace. This\ncan be done, without ever leaving the Particl Desktop client, by using the\nstandalone swap module which is currently being powered by partners such as \nStealthEX [https://stealthex.io] and SimpleSwap [https://simpleswap.io/].\n\nImprovements Through Better Bot Management Support\nTo explain more precisely what improvements Particl V3 will bring to the swap\nengine, Particl developer Arnold Bansemer takes the time to elaborate on the\ntopic.\n\n“The biggest part of the in-app swap engine changes is better bot management.\nBots will increasingly drive traffic onto the network and will end up playing a\nnon-trivial role in getting some external functionality into the Particl\necosystem.\n\nWhat we’re aiming to do with the ongoing changes being made to the swap engine\nis to create a set of defined functionalities and requirements for how bot info\nis received and processed which will push towards a standardized way of creating\n“legitimate” bots.\n\nUsing these requirements, the bot manager in PD will then effectively act as a\n“processing plant” for bots. The bot manager UI in the desktop will provide the\nuser with a way to manage different bots (add/remove/view details/etc).

Its only purpose is to stake on the network on\nbehalf of other wallets.\n\nCold staking significantly improves the security of your funds when staking.\nSince you’re putting in charge an external node to do the staking, you can store\nyour coins on any sort of device, online or off-line. That can be a cold wallet,\na hardware device (i.e. Ledger or Trezor), a mobile wallet (Particl Copay or\nFlare Wallet), a multi-signature address, and etc.\n\nIf your staking node ever gets breached into or hacked, the attacker wouldn’t be\nable to steal any coin as the node itself contains no coin at all.

added to Particl’s decentralized marketplace and desktop\napplication as of this 6th of July 2020 at 3:00 PM UTC. This allows you to\neasily top up your Particl account using Zcoin to privately buy anything on the\nParticl Marketplace. Zcoin is the first cryptocurrency, after Bitcoin, to be\nadded to Particl as an alternative account funding option.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Content\n * Zcoin Added to Particl\n * Particl Onboarding Talk: Zcoin — with Reuben Yap\n * How to Use Zcoin on Particl\n * Get Your Exclusive Zcoin Swag NOW!\n * A Perfect Match for Privacy Nuts\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nZcoin Added to Particl\nZcoin has been added to Particl Desktop and the Particl Marketplace. This comes\nahead of Particl V3.0, the biggest update to Particl’s marketplace ever, and\nwill give Zcoin fans an exclusive taste of things to come. To learn how Particl\nV3.0 is going to completely change the game, read this blog post\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813] \nabout it.\n\nStepping Things Up Again With Particl Desktop 3.0\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\nA New Breakthrough for Privacy and eCommerce ?particl.news\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\n\nThis integration provides the Zcoin community with a safe way to spend their\nZcoin without any intermediary and without leaving any digital footprint behind.\nNo transaction data, no personal information or communications collected, no\nmetadata, no nothing. To learn more about how the Particl Marketplace protects\nyour online privacy, read this in-depth blog post\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-part-3-6d5b0b1bf155] about it.\n\nFor Particl, it extends the marketplace’s accessibility by enabling one more\npayment option. It also lets you make even more private transactions when\nshopping online by combining the benefits of Zcoin’s privacy protocol with\nParticl’s.\n\n> Note: All purchases made on the marketplace are ultimately settled in PART.\nThat’s because payments need to be secured by Particl’s two-party escrow\nsmart-contract. This gives you protection against online scams and keeps your\npersonal information safe from any third-party. Learn more about Particl’s\ntwo-party escrow system here\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-double-deposit-mad-escrow-b3699dd29768].\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Onboarding Talk: Zcoin — with Reuben Yap\nTo discuss the integration, Zcoin’s Project Steward Reuben Yap and Particl\nambassador Dr. Kap met last week for an onboarding talk that has just been\npublished on Particl’s Youtube channel [https://youtube.com/particl].\n\nCheck it out as they discuss Zcoin, Particl, eCommerce, privacy, the economy,\nand much, much more!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to Use Zcoin on Particl\nThere are two ways to use Zcoin on Particl — by swapping Zcoin for PART as part\nof the checkout process or by simply using the in-app swap engine.\n\nBoth ways actually require the in-app swap engine to be manually enabled.\n\nEnable the StealthEx Swap Bot\n * Make sure that you are running the latest Particl version —Particl Desktop\n   2.3.4 [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.4].\n * Open Particl Desktop and wait for the blockchain and SMSG network to sync up.\n   The process of syncing SMSG usually takes longer than syncing the blockchain.\n * Click on the Bot Management button from the left sidebar.\n * Locate the StealthEx Swap Engine and click the Enable button.\n\nSwap Zcoin for PART Using the In-App Swap Engine\n * Make sure the StealthEx Swap Bot is enabled.\n * Click on the Exchange button from the left sidebar.\n * Click on Start New Exchange.\n * Enter the amount of PART you want to get and choose Zcoin within the list of\n   available currencies. Click Next.\n * Confirm the parameters of the swap and click Next.\n * Send the correct amount of Zcoin to the provided address. This can take\n   several minutes depending block times and StealthEx’s exchange process.\n * Check the Overview page to know when you receive your PART.\n\nUse Zcoin to Fund Your Account as Part of the Checkout Process\n * Install Particl Desktop\n   [https://particl.news/creation-of-the-default-wallet-on-the-particl-desktop-e39bc75c0978] \n   and enable the marketplace\n   [https://particl.news/enable-the-particl-marketplace-aa6ffa2c0ea8].\n * Make sure the StealthEx Swap Bot is enabled.\n * Browse the marketplace and add the item you want to purchase in your cart.\n * Click on the cart icon at the top of the Particl Desktop client and review\n   your order. Click Nextif everything is good.\n * Complete the check out process by entering your shipping details and\n   confirming your order.\n * A pop up will appear telling you that you don’t have enough PART to place the\n   order. Click on the Exchange BTC/alts button.\n * This will take you to the in-app swap engine with the number of Zcoin\n   required to complete the order pre-filled.\n * Swap Zcoin for PART using the in-app swap engine.\n * You will need to convert your balance to a private balance to use the\n   marketplace.\n * Once you receive your PART, click on the Send/Convert button from the left\n   sidebar.\n * Click on the Convert Public <-> Private tab at the top of the page.\n * In the Pay From section, select the source of funds you would like to\n   convert.\n * In the Convert To section, select the destination of funds you would like to\n   receive.\n * Type in the number of coins you’ve just received click on the Make Payment\n   button.\n * Review the transaction details and click on the Confirm & Send button to\n   confirm the transaction.\n * Wait for twelve (12) confirmations (approximately 24 minutes) before the\n   funds in the anon balance can be used.\n * You can track the status of this transaction nn the Overview page under\n   Recent Transactions.\n * Click the shopping cart icon at the top of your Particl Desktop client and\n   complete the process to place your order!\n\n> To track the progress of your swap, click on the Exchange button in the left\nsidebar and look for the ongoing exchange in the list that appears. Click on its\ntile to expand its details.\nGet Your Exclusive Swag Now!\nTo celebrate the listing of Zcoin on Particl, a few exclusive Zcoin goodies have\nbeen added to the marketplace for everyone to get. This includes shirts, caps,\nhoodies, and some very special mugs.\n\nFor the occasion, there are some pretty sweet but time-limited deals going on!\nFirst come, first serve, so make sure to hurry up!\n\n * First 20 shirts are 1 PART, the next 80 shirts will only be $5\n * First 10 hoodies are 1 PART, the next 20 hoodies will only be $5\n * First 20 mugs are 1 PART, the next 40 mugs will only be $5\n\n> Get them while the deal lasts!\nA Perfect Match for Privacy Nuts\nThe most interesting aspect of topping up your Particl account using Zcoin is\nthe compounding effect gained from combining different privacy protocols\ntogether. Whether you’re primarily a Zcoin or a Particl user, you can\nsignificantly raise your level of privacy and security when shopping online with \nthis simple trick\n[https://particl.news/zcoin-gets-listed-on-particl-7dfcf0bf69d4#8c4c].\n\nDifferent Approaches to Privacy\nZcoin and Particl adopt fundamentally different approaches to privacy and\nanonymize cryptocurrency transactions in different ways.\n\nZcoin uses what is known as SIGMA\n[https://zcoin.io/direct-untraceable-anonymous-lelantus/] and will soon move to\nits evolved version —Lelantus\n[https://zcoin.io/direct-untraceable-anonymous-lelantus/]. It is a\nzero-knowledge protocol that basically burns coins and redeems them at some\nlater point without any trail of how it got there being visible. It also allows\ndirect anonymous payments by giving the “right to redeem coins” to someone else.\nThis privacy protocol completely breaks the traceability of transactions.\n\nParticl, on the other hand, doesn’t destroy and redeem coins. It instead uses \nRingCT [https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd] \nto mix coins with others and uses “decoys” to obfuscate the payment trail even\nmore. Because RingCT transactions are mandatory for all marketplace\ntransactions, it protects users not only with strong cryptographic privacy but\nalso credible plausible deniability\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption].\n\nBoth of these approaches (burning/redeeming vs mixing) have their pros and cons.\nFor example, Zcoin may break the traceability of transactions more definitively\nbut Particl allows for a lot of flexibility which is a must since its\nmarketplace relies on privacy-oriented smart-contracts. As always with this kind\nof technology, there is never a clear winner and neither should there be. So why\nnot mix both protocols and get the best of both worlds?\n\nBetter Together\nWith just a few extra steps, you can combine the benefits of both privacy\nprotocols and get a much better level of online privacy when shopping online.\n\nAll you need to do is to first make a private transaction on the Zcoin network,\nredeem your coins, and use them to top up your Particl account with Particl\nDesktop’s in-app swap engine. This same process can also be done when checking\nout your cart on the Particl Marketplace.\n\nSimply follow these steps:\n\n * On Zcoin, execute a private XZC transaction.\n * Redeem the coins into a public address (ideally in a fresh wallet for added\n   privacy)\n * Open up Particl Desktop and initiate an XZC to PART swap\n * Send the PART you’ve received from the swap to an anon balance\n * Shop online in total privacy (SIGMA + RingCT)\n\nFollowing this simple trick will significantly improve your privacy when\nshopping online. Tracing back the payment back to you would not only require the\nParticl network to be deanonymized but the Zcoin network as well.\n\nSince both protocols are so fundamentally different, RingCT and SIGMA zero-day\nexploits are less likely to affect both protocols at the same time. If one\nprotocol ever fails, you know the other’s protecting you as a backup!\n\n> Note: Protecting your transaction information when shopping online is just one\nstep of the giant puzzle. Particl also natively protects your online identity,\nsecure your communications, doesn’t collect or even generate any metadata about\nyou, and lets you hide your network identity (IP address).

It is the first to develop and implement the Sigma Protocol, which\nallows users to have complete privacy over their transactions via zero-knowledge\ncryptographic proofs without the need for trusted setup. Its research labs also\ncreated the Lelantus privacy protocol which has gained academic acclaim and set\nto go live on Zcoin in 2020.\n\nIn 2018, Zcoin made history by having the Thai Democrat Party’s elections held\non its blockchain with over 127,000 votes cast nationwide.\n\nAbout Particl\nParticl is a privacy-first and worldwide censorship-resistant eCommerce platform\nbuilt on blockchain and peer-to-peer technology. It restores the balance of\npower towards the individual, not corporations or authorities, by decentralizing\ncore aspects of today’s internet and economy.\n\nThe Particl Marketplace is a decentralized and reliable multi-vendor marketplace\nthat lets anyone in the world buy and sell anything, without leaving a trace. It\neliminates the problems of trust, personal data abuse, and enrichment of large\ncorporations. It preserves privacy at any time and enables a trading scope for\nunbeatable product pricing. Free of any third-party interference, it creates a\nfair level playing field.\n\nThe Particl coin (PART) is the native currency of the Particl Marketplace. It is\na privacy coin that offers strong but flexible data protection and privacy\ncapabilities using a combination of the Confidential Transactions (CT) and\nRingCT (with Bulletproofs) privacy protocols. It is the first coin built on the\nBitcoin codebase to ever make these protocols available.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLearn More About Particl\n * What to expect in Particl V3.0\n   [https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\n * All about Particl’s fundamentals\n   [https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/ffbzfw/particl_chart_prior_to_its_massive_update/]\n * Complete collection of useful links\n   [https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/pxu0py/getting_started/]\n * Join the community on Telegram [https://t.me/ParticlOn]\n * Join the community on Discord [https://discord.me/particl]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Zcoin-is-Live-on-Particl/1-w3OMndBq3t132yt3_iMkDg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"the-world-s-most-private-way-to-shop-online\">The World’s Most Private Way to Shop Online</h3><p><strong>Zcoin</strong> has been added to Particl’s decentralized marketplace and desktop application as of this <strong>6th of July 2020 at 3:00 PM UTC</strong>.

Whether you’re primarily a Zcoin or a Particl user, you can significantly raise your level of privacy and security when shopping online with <a href=\"https://particl.news/zcoin-gets-listed-on-particl-7dfcf0bf69d4#8c4c\"><strong>this simple trick</strong></a>.</p><h2 id=\"different-approaches-to-privacy\">Different Approaches to Privacy</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Zcoin-is-Live-on-Particl/0-ol1PadCGMr0x-hDg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Zcoin and Particl adopt fundamentally different approaches to privacy and anonymize cryptocurrency transactions in different ways.</p><p>Zcoin uses what is known as <a href=\"https://zcoin.io/direct-untraceable-anonymous-lelantus/\"><strong>SIGMA</strong></a> and will soon move to its evolved version — <a href=\"https://zcoin.io/direct-untraceable-anonymous-lelantus/\"><strong>Lelantus</strong></a>.<strong> </strong>It is a zero-knowledge protocol that basically <strong>burns coins</strong> and <strong>redeems them</strong> at some later point without any trail of how it got there being visible. It also allows direct anonymous payments by giving the “right to redeem coins” to someone else. This privacy protocol completely breaks the traceability of transactions.</p><p>Particl, on the other hand, doesn’t destroy and redeem coins. It instead uses <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>RingCT</strong></a> to <strong>mix coins</strong> with others and uses “<strong>decoys</strong>” to obfuscate the payment trail even more. Because RingCT transactions are mandatory for all marketplace transactions, it protects users not only with strong cryptographic privacy but also credible <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption\">plausible deniability</a>.</p><p>Both of these approaches (burning/redeeming vs mixing) have their pros and cons. For example, Zcoin may break the traceability of transactions more definitively but Particl allows for a lot of flexibility which is a must since its marketplace relies on privacy-oriented smart-contracts. As always with this kind of technology, there is never a clear winner and neither should there be. So why not mix both protocols and get the best of both worlds?</p><h3 id=\"better-together\">Better Together</h3><p>With just a few extra steps, you can combine the benefits of both privacy protocols and get a much better level of online privacy when shopping online.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Zcoin-is-Live-on-Particl/0-qYgCKKNSqU9R8obf.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>All you need to do is to first make a private transaction on the Zcoin network, redeem your coins, and use them to top up your Particl account with Particl Desktop’s in-app swap engine.

Whether you’re primarily a Zcoin or a Particl user, you can significantly raise your level of privacy and security when shopping online with <a href=\"https://particl.news/zcoin-gets-listed-on-particl-7dfcf0bf69d4#8c4c\"><strong>this simple trick</strong></a>.</p><h2 id=\"different-approaches-to-privacy\">Different Approaches to Privacy</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Zcoin-is-Live-on-Particl/0-ol1PadCGMr0x-hDg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Zcoin and Particl adopt fundamentally different approaches to privacy and anonymize cryptocurrency transactions in different ways.</p><p>Zcoin uses what is known as <a href=\"https://zcoin.io/direct-untraceable-anonymous-lelantus/\"><strong>SIGMA</strong></a> and will soon move to its evolved version — <a href=\"https://zcoin.io/direct-untraceable-anonymous-lelantus/\"><strong>Lelantus</strong></a>.<strong> </strong>It is a zero-knowledge protocol that basically <strong>burns coins</strong> and <strong>redeems them</strong> at some later point without any trail of how it got there being visible. It also allows direct anonymous payments by giving the “right to redeem coins” to someone else. This privacy protocol completely breaks the traceability of transactions.</p><p>Particl, on the other hand, doesn’t destroy and redeem coins. It instead uses <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>RingCT</strong></a> to <strong>mix coins</strong> with others and uses “<strong>decoys</strong>” to obfuscate the payment trail even more. Because RingCT transactions are mandatory for all marketplace transactions, it protects users not only with strong cryptographic privacy but also credible <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption\">plausible deniability</a>.</p><p>Both of these approaches (burning/redeeming vs mixing) have their pros and cons. For example, Zcoin may break the traceability of transactions more definitively but Particl allows for a lot of flexibility which is a must since its marketplace relies on privacy-oriented smart-contracts. As always with this kind of technology, there is never a clear winner and neither should there be. So why not mix both protocols and get the best of both worlds?</p><h3 id=\"better-together\">Better Together</h3><p>With just a few extra steps, you can combine the benefits of both privacy protocols and get a much better level of online privacy when shopping online.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Zcoin-is-Live-on-Particl/0-qYgCKKNSqU9R8obf.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>All you need to do is to first make a private transaction on the Zcoin network, redeem your coins, and use them to top up your Particl account with Particl Desktop’s in-app swap engine. This same process can also be done when checking out your cart on the Particl Marketplace.</p><p><strong>Simply follow these steps:</strong></p><ul><li>On Zcoin, execute a private XZC transaction.</li><li>Redeem the coins into a public address (ideally in a fresh wallet for added privacy)</li><li>Open up Particl Desktop and initiate an XZC to PART swap</li><li>Send the PART you’ve received from the swap to an anon balance</li><li>Shop online in total privacy (SIGMA + RingCT)</li></ul><p>Following this simple trick will significantly improve your privacy when shopping online. Tracing back the payment back to you would not only require the Particl network to be deanonymized but the Zcoin network as well.</p><p>Since both protocols are so fundamentally different, RingCT and SIGMA zero-day exploits are less likely to affect both protocols at the same time. If one protocol ever fails, you know the other’s protecting you as a backup!</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> Protecting your transaction information when shopping online is just one step of the giant puzzle.

Particl team is excited to announce that leading privacy coin Zcoin will be\nadded to Particl’s decentralized marketplace and desktop application on the 6th\nof July 2020 at 3:00 PM UTC. This will allow you to easily top up your Particl\naccount using Zcoin to privately buy anything on the Particl Marketplace. Zcoin\nis the first cryptocurrency, after Bitcoin, to be added to Particl as an\nalternative account funding option.\n\nAdding Zcoin to Particl provides the Zcoin community with a safe way to spend\ntheir Zcoin without any intermediary and without leaving any digital footprint\nbehind. No transaction data, no personal information or communications\ncollected, no metadata, no nothing. To learn more about how the Particl\nMarketplace protects your online privacy, read this in-depth blog post\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-part-3-6d5b0b1bf155] about it.\n\nFor Particl, it extends the marketplace’s accessibility by enabling one more\npayment option. It also lets you make even more private transactions when\nshopping online by combining the benefits of Zcoin’s privacy protocol with\nParticl’s.\n\nThis news comes ahead of Particl V3.0, the biggest update to Particl’s\nmarketplace ever, and will give Zcoin fans a taste of things to come. To learn\nhow Particl V3.0 is going to completely change the game, read this blog post\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813] \nabout it.\n\nStepping Things Up Again With Particl Desktop 3.0\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\nA New Breakthrough for Privacy and eCommerce ?particl.news\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\n\nTo discuss the release, Zcoin’s Project Steward Reuben Yap and Particl\nambassador Dr. Kap will get together for an onboarding talk that will be\npublished on Particl’s Youtube channel [https://youtube.com/particl] on the 6th\nof July at 3:00 PM UTC.\n\n> Note: All purchases made on the marketplace are ultimately settled in PART.\nThat’s because payments need to be secured by Particl’s two-party escrow\nsmart-contract. This gives you protection against online scams and keeps your\npersonal information safe from any third-party. Learn more about Particl’s\ntwo-party escrow system here\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-double-deposit-mad-escrow-b3699dd29768].\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA Perfect Match for Privacy Nuts\nThe most interesting aspect of topping up your Particl account using Zcoin is\nthe compounding effect gained from combining different privacy protocols\ntogether. Whether you’re primarily a Zcoin or a Particl user, you can\nsignificantly raise your level of privacy and security when shopping online with \nthis simple trick.\n\nParticl MarketplaceDifferent Approaches to Privacy\nZcoin and Particl adopt fundamentally different approaches to privacy and\nanonymize cryptocurrency transactions in different ways.\n\nZcoin uses what is known as SIGMA\n[https://zcoin.io/direct-untraceable-anonymous-lelantus/] and will soon move to\nits evolved version —Lelantus\n[https://zcoin.io/direct-untraceable-anonymous-lelantus/]. It is a\nzero-knowledge protocol that basically burns coins and redeems them at some\nlater point without any trail of how it got there being visible. It also allows\ndirect anonymous payments by giving the “right to redeem coins” to someone else.\nThis privacy protocol completely breaks the traceability of transactions.\n\nParticl, on the other hand, doesn’t destroy and redeem coins. It instead uses \nRingCT [https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd] \nto mix coins with others and uses “decoys” to obfuscate the payment trail even\nmore. Because RingCT transactions are mandatory for all marketplace\ntransactions, it protects users not only with strong cryptographic privacy but\nalso credible plausible deniability\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption].\n\nBoth of these approaches (burning/redeeming vs mixing) have their pros and cons.\nFor example, Zcoin may break the traceability of transactions more definitively\nbut Particl allows for a lot of flexibility which is a must since its\nmarketplace relies on privacy-oriented smart-contracts. As always with this kind\nof technology, there is never a clear winner and neither should there be. So why\nnot mix both protocols and get the best of both worlds?\n\nTogether’s Better\nWith just a few extra steps, you can combine the benefits of both privacy\nprotocols and get a much better level of online privacy when shopping online.\n\nAll you need to do is to first make a private transaction on the Zcoin network,\nredeem your coins, and use them to top up your Particl account with Particl\nDesktop’s in-app swap engine. This same process can also be done when checking\nout your cart on the Particl Marketplace.\n\nSimply follow these steps:\n\n * On Zcoin, execute a private XZC transaction.\n * Redeem the coins into a public address (ideally in a fresh wallet for added\n   privacy)\n * Open up Particl Desktop and initiate an XZC to PART swap\n * Send the PART you’ve received from the swap to an anon balance\n * Shop online in total privacy (SIGMA + RingCT)\n\nFollowing this simple trick will significantly improve your privacy when\nshopping online. Tracing back the payment back to you would not only require the\nParticl network to be deanonymized but the Zcoin network as well.\n\nSince both protocols are so fundamentally different, RingCT and SIGMA zero-day\nexploits are less likely to affect both protocols at the same time. If one\nprotocol ever fails, you know the other’s protecting you as a backup!\n\n> Note: Protecting your transaction information when shopping online is just one\nstep of the giant puzzle. Particl also natively protects your online identity,\nsecure your communications, doesn’t collect or even generate any metadata about\nyou, and lets you hide your network identity (IP address).

What this means is that you can\nnow store, send, receive, and swap PART for any of the other available assets\nwithin Flare Wallet’s ecosystem. Flare Wallet is a non-custodial wallet, meaning\nthat their team doesn’t have access to your private keys at all, and is\navailable on both mobile and desktop platforms.\n\nFlare Wallet | Privacy Focused Cryptocurrency Wallet [https://flarewallet.io/]\nSecure privacy focused cryptocurrency wallet for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin\nand\nmany more.flarewallet.io [https://flarewallet.io/]\n\nTeamwork Within Privacy & Security Focused Projects\nThe addition of PART into Flare Wallet is an encouraging story amidst an\nindustry that has unfortunately turned increasingly “pay-to-play”. When one\nstand up Particl community member (thanks to CaptainSkywalker) reached out to\nthe Flare Wallet team, their team took the time to dive into Particl to see what\nit was all about. They then reached out to the Particl team with an interest in\nlisting the coin solely based on the nature (especially its focus on privacy and\nsecurity), vision, and constant development of the project.\n\nThe Flare Wallet team never asked for a listing fee or a portion of the supply.\nThey instead reached out simply to ask whether the Particl team would be okay\nwith getting PART added to their ecosystem and inquired about a few technical\nquestions.\n\nFor this reason, Cryptoguard opened up a donation bounty for any Particl\ncommunity member to show their appreciation to Flare Wallet’s approach to\nworking with other privacy and security projects, as opposed to straight up\nasking for a listing fee payment regardless of the nature of the project. At the\ntime of this writing, the donation address has accumulated a total of ~2,745\nPART and will be transferred, today, to the Flare Wallet team.\n\nThis also highlights how effective a community can be.

We’re all in\nthis together as a big family! ?\n\nFlare Wallet — One Solution for Atomic Swaps on Particl’s Marketplace?\nWhile Flare Wallet’s swap services currently work by leveraging third-party\npartners’ services (i.e. StealthEx), their team is actively working towards\nimplementing atomic swaps into their engine so that swaps conducted on their\nwallet would be entirely trustless (as in, no middleman required to execute a\nswap). This was a development both the Flare Wallet and Particl teams found very\ninteresting as it relates to Particl’s marketplace.\n\nAs it currently stands, Particl’s marketplace only accepts BTC (and of course,\nPART) through SimpleSwap [https://simpleswap.io], but it is entirely possible to\nadd more coins using many different swap services. That means that, once Flare\nWallet successfully pushes atomic swap style swaps in production, it could\neasily be integrated into Particl’s marketplace and Particl Desktop client.\n\nOf course, Particl’s Lead Core Developer and Cryptographer, Tecnovert, has been\nworking on his own implementation of atomic swaps, but as you already know,\nParticl has an agnostic approach to such services on its platform. An additional\natomic swap solution is very much appreciated as it would increase\ndecentralization ever more (in that case, by adding more options, thus making\nthe overall platform more resilient) and by bringing more volume and liquidity\nthrough Flare Wallet’s reach within their own community as well as the greater\ncryptocurrency community. After all, Flare Wallet is a relatively well-known\nwallet within the industry and has a good level of brand recognition.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore About Flare Wallet\nFlare is a multi-asset privacy focused cryptocurrency light wallet. All keys are\nmanaged locally and completely secured and encrypted by the end-user with a\nsimple 12 seed mnemonic phrase backup. There are no servers that manage your\nwallets for you — you control everything. We believe it is important to create a\nwallet interface that is both fashionable and simple to use while giving it as\nmuch power as possible. Being a multi-currency privacy focused wallet, it will\nalso include and focus on several privacy/security features:\n\n * Networking privacy: Flare will have the option of being routed through Tor\n   networking to give users the best possible network privacy when\n   sending/receiving/swapping.\n * Coin-Control support (after beta): Flare will give users the ability to\n   control their inputs for each transaction for coins that utilize UTXO sets.\n   Benefits of this will be outlined below.\n * Decentralized privacy swaps (after beta): Flare will allow users to swap\n   their coins within the wallet using decentralized methods while using the \n   NIX\n   protocol [https://nixplatform.io]to break the linkage between swaps.\n * Hardware wallet support (after beta): Being able to use your Ledger/Trezor\n   for supported coins within the wallet to ensure the highest possible asset\n   security.\n\nFor users who value their privacy, Flare will give the best support possible in\nany multi-currency wallet available. For users who are just looking for a secure\nwallet that supports/will support many popular coins for them to store their\nholdings, Flare will do just the job. No tricks, no signups, all decentralized.\n\nRead their full overview blog post here\n[https://medium.com/@flarewallet.io/what-is-flare-wallet-776f08a58c84].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have any comment or feedback, don’t hesitate to directly contact the\nFlare Wallet team and let them know about it by joining their Telegram channel \nhere [https://t.me/flarewallet].","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Added-on-Flare-Wallet/1-rkzcTCK5hR_4Kp4MYjTufA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"a-private-and-secure-light-wallet-working-on-atomic-swaps-\">A Private and Secure Light Wallet Working on Atomic Swaps ?</h3><blockquote><strong>Update (04–04–2020): </strong>PART is now also available on the desktop version of Flare wallet.</blockquote><hr><p>Particl is now available as an asset on the privacy and security focused light wallet <a href=\"https://flarewallet.io/\"><strong>Flare Wallet</strong></a>.

PART Exchange, BTC\non Mainnet Only)Today we’re excited to officially announce more details about\nParticl’s integration of a Bitcoin exchange module into the Particl Desktop\nclient. Initially mentioned\n[https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190359593550901248] last Friday by\nDr. Kapil Amarasinghe during his 30-minute talk at SFBW’s Epicenter\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZAmMXEvkPc], this new payment option will\nallow users to easily use Bitcoin as a form of payment on the Open Marketplace.\nThis news is directly in line with Particl’s current focus on adoption (in this\nparticular case, focused on the cryptocurrency crowd) and makes the Open\nMarketplace more accessible than ever, especially to people not currently part\nof the Particl community.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBitcoin Payment Integration\nHow the integration of this new feature will look like is as a separate,\nstandalone BTC-PART exchange module within Particl Desktop. The module will\ninteract with the checkout process but will not be directly integrated as part\nof the full buy flow. It will instead be displayed as a separate page within\nParticl Desktop.\n\nThe reason for this is simple — once BTC is transferred for PART, the received\nPART is always, at least initially, received on a public balance. As you\nprobably already know, the Open Marketplace funds stored on anon balances to be\nable to purchase products and services. And because converting funds from a\npublic balance to an anon one takes 12 confirmations, on top of which more\nconfirmations are added as a result of the exchange’s own confirmations\n(incoming Bitcoin confirmations, for example), the integration, as it currently\nstands, cannot be integrated as a core component of the buy flow in a\nuser-friendly and practical way.\n\nExchange Module…as a Separate Page\nWIP, Interface Subject to Change (Testnet Only Shows PART to PART Exchange, BTC\non Mainnet Only)How the integration of this BTC-PART module will look like is a\nsimple and convenient Exchange accessible right from the left sidebar of Particl\nDesktop! If you recall, on Particl Desktop, the Wallet section of the menu\ncurrently has these four pages: Send/Convert, Receive, History, and Address\nBook. This update will introduce fifth section, Exchange, to the Wallet section\nof the sidebar. This page will also be accessible from any regular wallet,\nmeaning the exchange feature won’t need to be manually activated by the user.\n\nPutting the Exchange page as a standalone page on any type of wallet means\nBitcoin users will be able to fund their wallets with PART using Bitcoin,\nallowing them to use any of the Particl Desktop features that requires a fee to\nbe paid (privacy transaction, community proposals, flagging items, etc).\n\nExchange Module…as Part of the Checkout Process\nWhile the exchange module will be a standalone application, at least for the\nforeseeable future, it will still be integrated into the checkout process and\ninteract with it. The process is simple — simply go through the same process of\npurchasing an item to your cart as you always do. Add an item to your cart,\nconfirm the cart’s content, enter your shipping information, and then land on\nthe order confirmation page. Right at that moment, you will be met with two\nbuttons — one to confirm your order, and the other to be redirected to the\nexchange module. If you do not have enough funds to place your order, then the\n“Confirm Order” button will be greyed out while the Exchange button will\nredirect you to the exchange module.\n\nOnce there, the module will automatically fill up the number of PART necessary\nto pay for your order and tell you exactly how many BTC are required to acquire\nthat many PART coins. You will then be able to send Bitcoin to the exchange\nmodule and receive PART in exchange. Once the exchange is completed, you’ll be\nable to easily come back to the confirmation section of the checkout process and\nsuccessfully place your order.\n\nSo while Bitcoin won’t directly be a “payment option” per se, the exchange\nmodule will still interact with your cart in a way that makes it easier and\nuser-friendly for everyone to get the right amount of PART using BTC.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThis BTC-PART exchange module will not be using atomic swaps of any sort of\ndecentralized exchange method, at least not for its initial integration.\nInstead, it will be plugged into a non-custodial exchange that doesn’t require\nKYC or personal information —SimpleSwap [https://simpleswap.io/].\n\nWIP, Interface Subject to Change (Testnet Only Shows PART to PART Exchange, BTC\non Mainnet Only)The module uses SMSG to relay messages between Particl and the\nSimpleSwap engine. The key part to understand is that this exchange module has\nbeen built using SMSG in a very generic matter, and it could eventually be used\nas the base layers to deploy all sorts of services on Particl (i.e. price\npegging, chat module, etc). This module is likely to be included in the incoming\nParticl SDK which is probably going to see the day somewhere in 2020.\n\nA “per transaction” limit function has also been integrated into the module as\nwell, making sure users exchange a number of coins that’s in between the minimum\nand maximum range allowed by the exchange. Most of the information that is\nusually displayed when making a transaction on [https://simpleswap.io/]\nSimpleSwap [https://simpleswap.io/] will also all be displayed right from\nParticl Desktop.\n\nAdditionally, the exchange module will also include an “auto-anonymizer” feature\nwhich will allow you to automatically receive your PART on anon balances. This\nadditional privacy feature included in Particl Desktop’s exchange module isn’t\navailable when simply going on [https://simpleswap.io/]SimpleSwap\n[https://simpleswap.io/]’s website. That RingCT exchange perk feature may, or\nmay not, be part of the first iteration of the exchange module, but it is\nalready in development and should follow very shortly after the first release if\nnot immediately ready.

Initially <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190359593550901248\"><strong>mentioned</strong></a> last Friday by Dr. Kapil Amarasinghe during his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZAmMXEvkPc\"><strong>30-minute talk at SFBW’s Epicenter</strong></a>, this new payment option will allow users to easily use Bitcoin as a form of payment on the Open Marketplace. This news is directly in line with Particl’s current focus on adoption (in this particular case, focused on the cryptocurrency crowd) and makes the Open Marketplace more accessible than ever, especially to people not currently part of the Particl community.</p><hr><h2 id=\"bitcoin-payment-integration\">Bitcoin Payment Integration</h2><p>How the integration of this new feature will look like is as a separate, standalone <strong>BTC-PART exchange module within Particl Desktop</strong>. The module will interact with the checkout process but will not be directly integrated as part of the full buy flow. It will instead be displayed as a <strong>separate page within Particl Desktop</strong>.</p><p>The reason for this is simple — once BTC is transferred for PART, the received PART is always, at least initially, received on a public balance. As you probably already know, the Open Marketplace funds stored on anon balances to be able to purchase products and services. And because converting funds from a public balance to an anon one takes 12 confirmations, on top of which more confirmations are added as a result of the exchange’s own confirmations (incoming Bitcoin confirmations, for example), the integration, as it currently stands, cannot be integrated as a core component of the buy flow in a user-friendly and practical way.</p><h3 id=\"exchange-module-as-a-separate-page\">Exchange Module…as a Separate Page</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Announces-Bitcoin-Exchange-Integration-Into-Particl-Desktop/1-KKLpgt3EjonmytUBz1ypiQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>WIP, Interface Subject to Change (Testnet Only Shows PART to PART Exchange, BTC on Mainnet Only)</figcaption></figure><p>How the integration of this BTC-PART module will look like is a simple and convenient Exchange accessible right from the left sidebar of Particl Desktop! If you recall, on Particl Desktop, the Wallet section of the menu currently has these four pages: Send/Convert, Receive, History, and Address Book. This update will introduce fifth section, Exchange, to the Wallet section of the sidebar. This page will also be accessible from any regular wallet, meaning the exchange feature won’t need to be manually activated by the user.</p><p>Putting the Exchange page as a standalone page on any type of wallet means Bitcoin users will be able to fund their wallets with PART using Bitcoin, allowing them to use any of the Particl Desktop features that requires a fee to be paid (privacy transaction, community proposals, flagging items, etc).</p><h3 id=\"exchange-module-as-part-of-the-checkout-process\">Exchange Module…as Part of the Checkout Process</h3><p>While the exchange module will be a standalone application, at least for the foreseeable future, it will still be integrated into the checkout process and interact with it. The process is simple — simply go through the same process of purchasing an item to your cart as you always do. Add an item to your cart, confirm the cart’s content, enter your shipping information, and then land on the order confirmation page. Right at that moment, you will be met with two buttons — one to confirm your order, and the other to be redirected to the exchange module. If you do not have enough funds to place your order, then the “Confirm Order” button will be greyed out while the Exchange button will redirect you to the exchange module.</p><p>Once there, the module will automatically fill up the number of PART necessary to pay for your order and tell you exactly how many BTC are required to acquire that many PART coins. You will then be able to send Bitcoin to the exchange module and receive PART in exchange. Once the exchange is completed, you’ll be able to easily come back to the confirmation section of the checkout process and successfully place your order.</p><p>So while Bitcoin won’t directly be a “payment option” per se, the exchange module will still interact with your cart in a way that makes it easier and user-friendly for everyone to get the right amount of PART using BTC.</p><h3 id=\"under-the-hood\">Under the Hood</h3><p><strong>This BTC-PART exchange module will not be using atomic swaps of any sort of decentralized exchange method</strong>, at least not for its initial integration.
