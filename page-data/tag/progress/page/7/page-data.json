This, in part, means traders can\nmake or take orders at a price of their choosing and on their own terms.\n\nAt this stage of the beta, only full BasicSwap nodes — which need to be compiled\nand ran locally — are available to use. We are however working on deploying more\nconvenient solutions using light and web services as well as integration\ngateways.\n\nFor more in-depth information about BasicSwap, head over to this blog post\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/].\n\nCore Values\nBasicSwap’s unique exchange architecture introduces a lot of benefits for\ncryptocurrency users. Notably, its cross-chain approach radically improves the\nbroader blockchain ecosystem, by promoting healthier and more open trading\nconditions for all, without forcing users to use a specific coin or blockchain\nfor monetization purposes. BasicSwap aims to take down barriers and build\nbridges between various cryptocurrency communities.\n\nThe BasicSwap DEX is shaped by its uncompromising dedication to five core values\nthat we believe are bound to be in the interest of all traders:\n\n 1. Full custody of funds and keys;\n 2. A coin-agnostic architecture;\n 3. No trading fees or intermediary fees of any kind;\n 4. No accounts, limits, or restrictions;\n 5. Complete and total privacy.\n\nThese are the five constitutional values that make up the idea behind the\nBasicSwap protocol, and they guide every step of the way forward.\n\nFrom the Ground up — Uncompromising Commitment to Privacy\nBasicSwap is certainly not the first DEX around, but it does distinguish itself\nin its uncompromising commitment to user privacy. When we say BasicSwap is a\nprivacy-first DEX, it’s not just for buzz; we truly mean it.\n\nIndeed, BasicSwap is born out of a proof of concept\n[https://particl.news/monero-and-particl-atomic-swaps-775f87f6208a/] made 2\nyears ago when the Particl team began testing Monero atomic swaps\n[https://github.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap]. This eventually led to the\nrelease of a rudimentary DEX protocol that used Particl’s privacy-first SMSG\nnetwork, which eventually culminated into the more all-inclusive DEX platform\nthat we see today — complete with an order book and a modern, intuitive GUI.\n\nSuffice to say, privacy has always been at the core of BasicSwap’s history, and\nis its primary reason for existence. This holds true today more than ever.\n\nUnder the Hood\nBasicSwap is made up of a unique combination of leading-edge technologies in the\ndomains of blockchain, cryptography, and peer-to-peer networking. At no point\ndoes it use any centralized or intermediated components — ensuring the maximum\nlevel of security and privacy for all users and their hard-earned funds.\nCensorship, fraud, and misuse of user funds are fundamentally impossible from\nthe application to the protocol level.\n\nAtomic Swaps Atomic swaps have been around for quite some time and are an\nimportant part of many DEX platforms currently available online. They allow for\nswapping digital assets between two users in peer-to-peer fashion, assuming that\nthe logistical requirements behind executing such a swap exist. \n\nThe atomic swap technology is, in and of itself, a relatively narrow-scoped\nprotocol: it does not match orders between two users or provide any DEX\nframework whatsoever. It only safely swaps assets. \n\nFor a properly decentralized DEX to exist, it needs a common and decentralized\nchannel in which the information related to a swap is transferred between two\nparties — sometimes across two entirely different chains. Without this added\nlayer, it is impossible for a chain to know when to release the swap in question\nbecause it isn’t directly connected to the other blockchain. \n\nThis is often where some so-called “DEXs” cut corners and introduce a certain\nlevel of centralization. They offer decentralized swaps, but centralize the\nprocess of matching orders which entirely defeats the purpose of being a DEX in\nthe first place as it introduces a major central point of failure and control.\nIn the case of BasicSwap, this process remains entirely decentralized, thanks to\nthe SMSG network. \n\nMore detailed information on atomic swaps can be found here\n[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Atomic_swap]. \n\nin-progress waiting done SecureMessaging Network (SMSG) SecureMessaging (SMSG)\nis Particl’s own custom-built and unique P2P messaging network, which stands at\nthe core of its ecosystem. Inspired by the BitMessage Protocol\n[https://www.whonix.org/wiki/BitMessage], the SMSG network is a mixnet that acts\nas a decentralized storage network (DSN)\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/glossary.html#term-SecureMessaging-SMSG].\nAs such, it stores and transfers data across nodes in a privacy-preserving\nmanner, encrypted from end to end (E2EE), and without requiring the use of a\ncentral server. \n\nThis decentralized technology is essential in providing the BasicSwap DEX with\nfunctionality not provided by atomic swaps themselves, such as an order book and\norder matching system, as well as with transferring swap data between parties\nswapping from two different chains. \n\nWhen running a BasicSwap client, you are also automatically running an SMSG node\nalong with it. Any DEX and swap related data is then uploaded and downloaded\ndirectly from the SMSG network and interpreted by BasicSwap’s scriptless\nscripts, giving users a full-blown decentralized trading exchange (DEX)\nexperience. \n\nMore in-depth information about the SMSG protocol can be found here\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/] \n\nin-progress waiting done Scriptless Scripts Scriptless scripts are another key\naspect of BasicSwap and are a largely misunderstood and overlooked feature of\nBitcoin and blockchains in general. Originating from MimbleWimble, they are, in\ntheir basic sense, a way to execute secure and private smart contracts off-chain\nusing Schnorr Signatures [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature] or \nECDSA [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm]\n. \n\nIn the case of BasicSwap, two people send coins on a scriptless chain and into\nan address that's created from the sum of one private key from each of them.\nThat way, to spend that output requires them to cooperate through One-Time\nVerifiably Encrypted Signatures (OtVES)\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L154]\n. \n\n> \"A One-Time VES is a signature made invalid by mixing it with the public key of\nan encrypting key pair, a valid signature can be decrypted with knowledge of the\nprivate encrypting key and the private encrypting key can be recovered with\nknowledge of both the encrypted and plaintext signatures.\" Tecnovert — xmrswap\nprotocol notes\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L156] \n \n\n\nCompared to traditional on-chain smart contracts, scriptless scripts provide\nadded privacy and scalability. And compared to the rigid and barebone Bitcoin\nsmart contracts, they add a ton of functionality by allowing for much more\ncomplex and flexible, yet still securely tight, smart contracts. \n\nPrivacy: When on-chain, many details of a smart contract are shared to the\nentire network. These details include the number and addresses of participants\nand the amounts transferred, among other metadata. But because scriptless\nscripts are essentially smart contracts operating off-chain, most of the usage\ndata and user information is NOT shared with the rest of the network. The only\nthing that the network knows is that certain individuals are interacting with a\nsmart contract according to its pre-defined rules. However, depending on the\nspecific implementation, it is also possible for that information to be\ncompletely hidden. \n\nScalability: Smart contracts take up a lot of space on a blockchain. By moving\nthe smart contracting process off-chain, that data does not fill up and bloat\nthe blockchain, leading to much better scalability. The smart contracting\nprocess is also shared between scriptless scripts themselves and the SMSG\nnetwork. \n\nAdditionally, because scriptless scripts are eventually intended to leverage\nSchnorr Signatures, multiple keys can be aggregated into a single one — making\nthe actual smart contract code much lighter and more efficient than traditional\non-chain smart contracts. \n\nin-progress waiting done About the Open Beta Release\nBasicSwap’s open beta is now live, on mainnet, for everyone. That means you can\nnow set up the DEX and start trading with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Monero,\nand others without middlemen, without restrictions, and with no need to worry\nabout the custody of your coins.\n\nConsiderations — What to Expect at This Beta Stage\nThe release of the open beta is a major milestone for BasicSwap, but it is by no\nmeans intended as the final version of it. Indeed, we have much bigger plans for\nit, which you can get a hint at by checking out our roadmap\n[https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap].\n\nIndeed, we feel it is important to put emphasis on the beta aspect of this\nrelease. As such, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:\n\n * It may lack features that you’d like to see in the future.\n * It may feel unfinished or unpolished in some areas.\n * It still needs to be manually compiled.\n * It requires full coin nodes to be synced up and run locally.\n * It requires your node to stay online to complete swaps.\n * It requires your node to stay online for your offers to show up on the books.\n * It requires coin wallets to be unlocked when running.\n\nAll of the considerations mentioned above are merely temporary obstacles that we\nfully plan on resolving as we progress through this open beta phase. Consult\nour\nroadmap [https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap], scheduled to release this coming\nMonday, to get a better understanding of our plans moving forward and of the\nways we intend to improve the platform.\n\nRoadmap and Vision — What’s Next?\nWhile the open beta release of BasicSwap is a major milestone in its journey,\nthe best is yet to come. Indeed, BasicSwap is poised to evolve into a major,\nunstoppable DEX platform with significant innovations that will benefit the\nentire crypto ecosystem.\n\nGenerally speaking, the team will focus on four major technical items moving\nforward, with various other additions, improvements, and fixes along the way.\n\n * SMSG 2.0 — For better scalability, privacy, and efficiency;\n * Integration frameworks — To integrate BasicSwap into third-party platforms,\n   web apps, and more;\n * Privacy-centric updates — To improve user privacy and fund security;\n * Lightning Network — For near-instant swap speed (on eligible coins) and\n   capabilities.\n\nThese are the cornerstone items of our current roadmap. They are the most\nsignificant milestones and the keys to BasicSwap’s vision. While we work on\nthese, you can expect a wide variety of non-related features and improvements to\nalso be added.\n\nAdditionally, we fully plan on adding more coins to the platform as demand for\nit comes our way. As such, we’ve set up a listing application form\n[https://forms.gle/UZhdUJAXdEumVdBi8] on our website that can be filled out to\nrequest new coin listings. Note that, due to BasicSwap’s unique architecture and\nour current development resources, we cannot guarantee a fast integration\nprocess for all coins that apply, but we’ll do our best to work with you on\nthese matters.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo here we are - BasicSwap’s open beta is finally upon us. If you want to\ncontribute to the DEX revolution and help take the power away from those\ngatekeepers best known as centralized exchanges, then spread the word far and\nwide and bring your liquidity on a fair, open, and honest platform for all!\n\nAs more people use decentralized exchanges, liquidity will grow, which will\ncontribute to bringing better, more free trading conditions for all crypto\nusers. A winning scenario for all users of cryptocurrencies and participants in\nthe new digital economy.\n\nBig thank you to all for participating in this open beta, and for anchoring\nyourself in history. We can’t wait to hear about your feedback and see the\nplatform and its usage grow over time!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

That means you can now set up the DEX and start trading with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Monero, and others without middlemen, without restrictions, and with no need to worry about the custody of your coins.</p><h3 id=\"considerations-what-to-expect-at-this-beta-stage\">Considerations — What to Expect at This Beta Stage</h3><p>The release of the open beta is a major milestone for BasicSwap, but it is by no means intended as the final version of it. Indeed, we have much bigger plans for it, which you can get a hint at by <a href=\"https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap\"><strong>checking out our roadmap</strong></a>.</p><p>Indeed, we feel it is important to put emphasis on the beta aspect of this release. As such, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>It may lack features that you’d like to see in the future.</li><li>It may feel unfinished or unpolished in some areas.</li><li>It still needs to be manually compiled.</li><li>It requires full coin nodes to be synced up and run locally.</li><li>It requires your node to stay online to complete swaps.</li><li>It requires your node to stay online for your offers to show up on the books.</li><li>It requires coin wallets to be unlocked when running.</li></ul><p>All of the considerations mentioned above are merely <strong>temporary obstacles</strong> that we fully plan on resolving as we progress through this open beta phase. <a href=\"https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap\"><strong>Consult our roadmap</strong></a>, scheduled to release this coming Monday, to get a better understanding of our plans moving forward and of the ways we intend to improve the platform.</p><h2 id=\"roadmap-and-vision-what-s-next\">Roadmap and Vision — What’s Next?</h2><p>While the open beta release of BasicSwap is a major milestone in its journey, the best is yet to come. Indeed, BasicSwap is poised to evolve into a major, unstoppable DEX platform with significant innovations that will benefit the entire crypto ecosystem.</p><p>Generally speaking, the team will focus on four major technical items moving forward, with various other additions, improvements, and fixes along the way.</p><ul><li><strong>SMSG 2.0 — </strong>For better scalability, privacy, and efficiency;</li><li><strong>Integration frameworks —</strong> To integrate BasicSwap into third-party platforms, web apps, and more;</li><li><strong>Privacy-centric updates — </strong>To improve user privacy and fund security;</li><li><strong>Lightning Network —</strong> For near-instant swap speed (on eligible coins) and capabilities.</li></ul><p>These are the cornerstone items of our current roadmap. They are the most significant milestones and the keys to BasicSwap’s vision. While we work on these, you can expect a wide variety of non-related features and improvements to also be added.</p><p>Additionally, we fully plan on adding more coins to the platform as demand for it comes our way. As such, we’ve set up a <a href=\"https://forms.gle/UZhdUJAXdEumVdBi8\">listing application form</a> on our website that can be filled out to request new coin listings. Note that, due to BasicSwap’s unique architecture and our current development resources, we cannot guarantee a fast integration process for all coins that apply, but we’ll do our best to work with you on these matters.</p><hr><p>So here we are - BasicSwap’s open beta is finally upon us. If you want to contribute to the DEX revolution and help take the power away from those gatekeepers best known as centralized exchanges, then spread the word far and wide and bring your liquidity on a fair, open, and honest platform for all!</p><p>As more people use decentralized exchanges, liquidity will grow, which will contribute to bringing better, more free trading conditions for all crypto users. A winning scenario for all users of cryptocurrencies and participants in the new digital economy.</p><p>Big thank you to all for participating in this open beta, and for anchoring yourself in history. We can’t wait to hear about your feedback and see the platform and its usage grow over time!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

Notably, its cross-chain approach radically improves the broader blockchain ecosystem, by promoting healthier and more open trading conditions for all, without forcing users to use a specific coin or blockchain for monetization purposes. BasicSwap aims to take down barriers and build bridges between various cryptocurrency communities.</p><p>The BasicSwap DEX is shaped by its uncompromising dedication to five core values that we believe are bound to be in the interest of all traders:</p><ol><li>Full custody of funds and keys;</li><li>A coin-agnostic architecture;</li><li>No trading fees or intermediary fees of any kind;</li><li>No accounts, limits, or restrictions;</li><li>Complete and total privacy.</li></ol><p>These are the five constitutional values that make up the idea behind the BasicSwap protocol, and they guide every step of the way forward.</p><h3 id=\"from-the-ground-up-uncompromising-commitment-to-privacy\">From the Ground up — Uncompromising Commitment to Privacy</h3><p>BasicSwap is certainly not the first DEX around, but it does distinguish itself in its uncompromising commitment to user privacy. When we say BasicSwap is a privacy-first DEX, it’s not just for buzz; we truly mean it.</p><p>Indeed, BasicSwap is born out of a <a href=\"https://particl.news/monero-and-particl-atomic-swaps-775f87f6208a/\">proof of concept</a> made 2 years ago when the Particl team began testing <a href=\"https://github.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap\">Monero atomic swaps</a>. This eventually led to the release of a rudimentary DEX protocol that used Particl’s privacy-first SMSG network, which eventually culminated into the more all-inclusive DEX platform that we see today — complete with an order book and a modern, intuitive GUI.</p><p>Suffice to say, privacy has always been at the core of BasicSwap’s history, and is its primary reason for existence. This holds true today more than ever.</p><h3 id=\"under-the-hood\">Under the Hood</h3><p>BasicSwap is made up of a unique combination of leading-edge technologies in the domains of blockchain, cryptography, and peer-to-peer networking. At no point does it use any centralized or intermediated components — ensuring the maximum level of security and privacy for all users and their hard-earned funds. Censorship, fraud, and misuse of user funds are fundamentally impossible from the application to the protocol level.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center full light-one\" id=\"btn-add_01\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"col\">\n    <div class=\"tabs\">\n      <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">Atomic Swaps</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Atomic swaps have been around for quite some time and are an important part of many DEX platforms currently available online.

These details include the number and addresses of participants and the amounts transferred, among other metadata. But because scriptless scripts are essentially smart contracts operating off-chain, most of the usage data and user information is NOT shared with the rest of the network. The only thing that the network knows is that certain individuals are interacting with a smart contract according to its pre-defined rules. However, depending on the specific implementation, it is also possible for that information to be completely hidden.\n            <br><br>\n            <b>Scalability:</b> Smart contracts take up a lot of space on a blockchain. By moving the smart contracting process off-chain, that data does not fill up and bloat the blockchain, leading to much better scalability. The smart contracting process is also shared between scriptless scripts themselves and the SMSG network.\n            <br><br>\n            Additionally, because scriptless scripts are eventually intended to leverage Schnorr Signatures, multiple keys can be aggregated into a single one — making the actual smart contract code much lighter and more efficient than traditional on-chain smart contracts.\n            <p></p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    </div><!-- tabs close-->\n  </div><!-- col close-->\n</div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id=\"about-the-open-beta-release\">About the Open Beta Release</h2><p><strong>BasicSwap’s open beta is now live</strong>, on mainnet, for everyone. That means you can now set up the DEX and start trading with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Monero, and others without middlemen, without restrictions, and with no need to worry about the custody of your coins.</p><h3 id=\"considerations-what-to-expect-at-this-beta-stage\">Considerations — What to Expect at This Beta Stage</h3><p>The release of the open beta is a major milestone for BasicSwap, but it is by no means intended as the final version of it. Indeed, we have much bigger plans for it, which you can get a hint at by <a href=\"https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap\"><strong>checking out our roadmap</strong></a>.</p><p>Indeed, we feel it is important to put emphasis on the beta aspect of this release. As such, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>It may lack features that you’d like to see in the future.</li><li>It may feel unfinished or unpolished in some areas.</li><li>It still needs to be manually compiled.</li><li>It requires full coin nodes to be synced up and run locally.</li><li>It requires your node to stay online to complete swaps.</li><li>It requires your node to stay online for your offers to show up on the books.</li><li>It requires coin wallets to be unlocked when running.</li></ul><p>All of the considerations mentioned above are merely <strong>temporary obstacles</strong> that we fully plan on resolving as we progress through this open beta phase. <a href=\"https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap\"><strong>Consult our roadmap</strong></a>, scheduled to release this coming Monday, to get a better understanding of our plans moving forward and of the ways we intend to improve the platform.</p><h2 id=\"roadmap-and-vision-what-s-next\">Roadmap and Vision — What’s Next?</h2><p>While the open beta release of BasicSwap is a major milestone in its journey, the best is yet to come. Indeed, BasicSwap is poised to evolve into a major, unstoppable DEX platform with significant innovations that will benefit the entire crypto ecosystem.</p><p>Generally speaking, the team will focus on four major technical items moving forward, with various other additions, improvements, and fixes along the way.</p><ul><li><strong>SMSG 2.0 — </strong>For better scalability, privacy, and efficiency;</li><li><strong>Integration frameworks —</strong> To integrate BasicSwap into third-party platforms, web apps, and more;</li><li><strong>Privacy-centric updates — </strong>To improve user privacy and fund security;</li><li><strong>Lightning Network —</strong> For near-instant swap speed (on eligible coins) and capabilities.</li></ul><p>These are the cornerstone items of our current roadmap. They are the most significant milestones and the keys to BasicSwap’s vision. While we work on these, you can expect a wide variety of non-related features and improvements to also be added.</p><p>Additionally, we fully plan on adding more coins to the platform as demand for it comes our way. As such, we’ve set up a <a href=\"https://forms.gle/UZhdUJAXdEumVdBi8\">listing application form</a> on our website that can be filled out to request new coin listings. Note that, due to BasicSwap’s unique architecture and our current development resources, we cannot guarantee a fast integration process for all coins that apply, but we’ll do our best to work with you on these matters.</p><hr><p>So here we are - BasicSwap’s open beta is finally upon us. If you want to contribute to the DEX revolution and help take the power away from those gatekeepers best known as centralized exchanges, then spread the word far and wide and bring your liquidity on a fair, open, and honest platform for all!</p><p>As more people use decentralized exchanges, liquidity will grow, which will contribute to bringing better, more free trading conditions for all crypto users. A winning scenario for all users of cryptocurrencies and participants in the new digital economy.</p><p>Big thank you to all for participating in this open beta, and for anchoring yourself in history. We can’t wait to hear about your feedback and see the platform and its usage grow over time!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

our weekly development\nprogress report! So let's quickly see what progress has been made in the past\nfew days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nThis week, we have completed the integration of all marketplace-related changes\ninto Particl Desktop. That means we're now at the final item before we can push\nParticl Desktop 3.3 on testnet, which is to proceed through a series of minor\ntweaks and improvements to the desktop client.\n\nOnce completed, we'll run a series of internal tests and then deploy the build\non testnet for a few days before launching on mainnet, hopefully before\nChristmas time! ?\n\nRemaining Items for Particl Desktop 3.3\n 1. (In progress) A couple of general but minor tweaks and minor\n    improvements/optimizations need to be done, but they are negligible in terms\n    of effort to sort out.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As usual, we've been\nkeeping up with upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain\nParticl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. You can always keep track\nof those changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nAdded Shamir39 Protocol Into Core ?\nrpc: Add splitmnemonic and combinemnemonic · particl/particl-core@4eb2269\nCompatible with:https://iancoleman.io/shamir39/GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commit/4eb22699652221c3c1ac91ac77596bbcf18dc599]\nOver the past few days, we've added the Shamir39 protocol\n[https://github.com/iancoleman/shamir39] into Particl Core, which allows for\nsplitting a mnemonic into different parts for sharing with other parties safely.\n\n> BIP39 Mnemonics are a simple way to back up an entire wallet. The downside of\nmnemonics is if they're shared with others the private keys may be compromised\nfrom lack of security of those it's shared with.\n\nSplitting a secret into components using Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme (SSSS)\nalleviates this risk, but the benefit of using human readable words is lost\nsince secrets are typically encoded in a binary format.\n\nThis proposal is a way to split a BIP39 mnemonic into parts via SSSS without\nlosing the benefits of the original mnemonic encoding. This is achieved by\nencoding the SSSS shares as mnemonics themselves, which can then be distributed\nto others with much lower risk of the private keys of the original mnemonic\nbeing compromised or lost. — Shamir39's Specification Notes\n[https://github.com/iancoleman/shamir39/blob/master/specification.md]\nIn other words, Shamir39 allows you to split a mnemonic into equally secure\nparts and share it with others, as opposed to sharing half of a single mnemonic\nand, by doing so, halving the security of your wallet.\n\n * You can read more about the protocol here: \n   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir's_Secret_Sharing\n   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing]\n\nBasicSwap ?\nJust as last week, we've been ensuring a smooth and stable public release of\nBasicSwap's open beta.

time has finally come! After a successful and productive closed beta testing\nround, BasicSwap is now ready to publicly move to its open beta phase!\n\nIndeed, on the 8th of December at 15:00 UTC, the privacy-first and cross-chain\nDEX will go live, allowing everyone to trade cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin,\nMonero, Particl and others on an entirely distributed protocol, without third\nparty involvement of any kind.\n\nThis blog post will reveal everything you need to know about the upcoming beta\nlaunch, so make sure that you don’t skip on it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Contents\n * What’s BasicSwap\n * Open Beta Release Information\n * BasicSwap Website and Roadmap\n * What’s Next?\n\nNote: If you’re already familiar with BasicSwap, you may want to immediately\njump to this section containing all the information you need to know ahead of\nthe open beta release.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s BasicSwap\n> The Privacy-First and Cross-Chain DEX That Wants to Free Crypto\nAs bold the above statement may sound, this really is what BasicSwap is setting\nout to do.\n\nBasicSwap is a distributed cryptocurrency exchange protocol that lets you trade\ndifferent cryptocurrencies without the use of third-parties or middlemen using\nwhat is known as ‘atomic swaps’.\n\nThe DEX works using an order book system, in contrast to the liquidity pool\n(i.e. AMM) approach\n[https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm] \nthat most other DEXs have opted for. This, in part, means traders can make or\ntake orders at a price of their choosing and on their own terms.\n\nAt this stage of the beta, only full BasicSwap nodes — which need to be compiled\nand run locally — are available to use. We are however working on deploying more\nconvenient solutions using light and web services as well as integration\ngateways.\n\nFor more in-depth information about BasicSwap, head over to this blog post\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/].\n\nCore Values\nBasicSwap’s unique exchange architecture introduces a lot of benefits for\ncryptocurrency users. Notably, its cross-chain approach radically improves the\nbroader blockchain ecosystem, by promoting healthier and open trading conditions\nfor all, without forcing users to use a specific coin or blockchain for\nmonetization purposes. BasicSwap aims to take down barriers and build bridges\nbetween various cryptocurrency communities.\n\nThe BasicSwap DEX is shaped by its uncompromising dedication to five core values\nthat are bound to be in the interest of all traders:\n\n 1. Full custody of funds and keys;\n 2. A coin-agnostic architecture;\n 3. No trading fees or intermediary fees of any kind;\n 4. No accounts, limits, or restrictions;\n 5. Complete and total privacy.\n\nThese are the five constitutional values that make up the idea behind the\nBasicSwap protocol, and they guide every step of the way forward.\n\nFrom the Ground up — Uncompromising Commitment to Privacy\nBasicSwap is certainly not the first DEX around, but it does distinguish itself\nin its uncompromising commitment to user privacy. When we say BasicSwap is a\nprivacy-first DEX, it’s not just for buzz; we truly mean it.\n\nIndeed, BasicSwap is born out of a proof of concept\n[https://particl.news/monero-and-particl-atomic-swaps-775f87f6208a/] made 2\nyears ago when the Particl team began testing Monero atomic swaps\n[https://github.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap]. This eventually led to the\nrelease of a rudimentary DEX protocol that used Particl’s privacy-first SMSG\nnetwork, which eventually culminated into the more all-inclusive DEX platform\nthat we see today — complete with an order book and a modern, intuitive GUI.\n\nSuffice to say, privacy has always been at the core of BasicSwap’s history, and\nis its primary reason for existence. This holds true today more than ever with\nthe planned addition of several privacy-enhancing protocols such as Taproot,\nSMSG 2.0, Lightning Network, and more. \n\nUnder the Hood\nBasicSwap is made up of a unique combination of leading-edge technologies in the\ndomains of blockchain, cryptography, and peer-to-peer networking. At no point\ndoes it use any centralized or intermediated components — ensuring the maximum\nlevel of security and privacy for all users and their hard-earned funds.\nCensorship, fraud, and misuse of user funds are fundamentally impossible from\nthe application to the protocol level.\n\nAtomic Swaps Atomic swaps have been around for quite some time and are an\nimportant part of many DEX platforms currently available online. They allow for\nswapping digital assets between two users in peer-to-peer fashion, assuming that\nthe logistical requirements behind executing such a swap exist. \n\nThe atomic swap technology is, in and of itself, a relatively narrow-scoped\nprotocol: it does not match orders between two users or provide any DEX\nframework whatsoever. It only safely swaps assets. \n\nFor a properly decentralized DEX to exist, it needs a common and decentralized\nchannel in which the information related to a swap is transferred between two\nparties — sometimes across two entirely different chains. Without this added\nlayer, it is impossible for a chain to know when to release the swap in question\nbecause it isn’t directly connected to the other blockchain. \n\nThis is often where some so-called “DEXs” cut corners and introduce a certain\nlevel of centralization. They offer decentralized swaps, but centralize the\nprocess of matching orders which entirely defeats the purpose of being a DEX in\nthe first place as it introduces a major central point of failure and control.\nIn the case of BasicSwap, this process remains entirely decentralized, thanks to\nthe SMSG network. \n\nMore detailed information on atomic swaps can be found here\n[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Atomic_swap]. \n\nin-progress waiting done SecureMessaging Network (SMSG) SecureMessaging (SMSG)\nis Particl’s own custom-built and unique P2P messaging network, which stands at\nthe core of its ecosystem. Inspired by the BitMessage Protocol\n[https://www.whonix.org/wiki/BitMessage], the SMSG network is a mixnet that acts\nas a decentralized storage network (DSN)\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/glossary.html#term-SecureMessaging-SMSG].\nAs such, it stores and transfers data across nodes in a privacy-preserving\nmanner, encrypted from end to end (E2EE), and without requiring the use of a\ncentral server. \n\nThis decentralized technology is essential in providing the BasicSwap DEX with\nfunctionality not provided by atomic swaps themselves, such as an order book and\norder matching system, as well as with transferring swap data between parties\nswapping from two different chains. \n\nWhen running a BasicSwap client, you are also automatically running an SMSG node\nalong with it. Any DEX and swap related data is then uploaded and downloaded\ndirectly from the SMSG network and interpreted by BasicSwap’s scriptless\nscripts, giving users a full-blown decentralized trading exchange (DEX)\nexperience. \n\nMore in-depth information about the SMSG protocol can be found here\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/] \n\nin-progress waiting done Scriptless Scripts Scriptless scripts are another key\naspect of BasicSwap and are a largely misunderstood and overlooked feature of\nBitcoin and blockchains in general. Originating from MimbleWimble, they are, in\ntheir basic sense, a way to execute secure and private smart contracts off-chain\nusing Schnorr Signatures [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature] or \nECDSA [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm]\n. \n\nIn the case of BasicSwap, two people send coins on a scriptless chain and into\nan address that's created from the sum of one private key from each of them.\nThat way, to spend that output requires them to cooperate through One-Time\nVerifiably Encrypted Signatures (OtVES)\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L154]\n. \n\n> \"A One-Time VES is a signature made invalid by mixing it with the public key of\nan encrypting key pair, a valid signature can be decrypted with knowledge of the\nprivate encrypting key and the private encrypting key can be recovered with\nknowledge of both the encrypted and plaintext signatures.\" Tecnovert — xmrswap\nprotocol notes\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L156] \n \n\n\nCompared to traditional on-chain smart contracts, scriptless scripts provide\nadded privacy and scalability. And compared to the rigid and barebone Bitcoin\nsmart contracts, they add a ton of functionality by allowing for much more\ncomplex and flexible, yet still securely tight, smart contracts. \n\nPrivacy: When on-chain, many details of a smart contract are shared to the\nentire network. These details include the number and addresses of participants\nand the amounts transferred, among other metadata. But because scriptless\nscripts are essentially smart contracts operating off-chain, most of the usage\ndata and user information is NOT shared with the rest of the network. The only\nthing that the network knows is that certain individuals are interacting with a\nsmart contract according to its pre-defined rules. However, depending on the\nspecific implementation, it is also possible for that information to be\ncompletely hidden. \n\nScalability: Smart contracts take up a lot of space on a blockchain.

That means you’ll be able to set up the DEX and start trading with\ncryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Monero, and others without middlemen, without\nrestrictions, and with no need to worry about the custody of your coins.\n\nConsiderations — What to Expect on Launch Day\nThe release of the open beta is a major milestone for BasicSwap, but it is by no\nmeans intended as the final version of BasicSwap.\n\nIndeed, we feel it is important to put emphasis on the beta aspect of this\nrelease. As such, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:\n\n * It may lack features that you’d like to see in the future.\n * It may feel unfinished or unpolished in some areas.\n * It still needs to be manually compiled.\n * It requires full coin nodes to be synced up and run locally.\n * It requires your node to stay online to complete swaps.\n * It requires your node to stay online for your offers to show up on the books.\n * It requires coin wallets to be unlocked when running.\n\nAll of the considerations mentioned above are merely temporary obstacles that we\nfully plan on resolving as we progress through this open beta phase. Consult our\nroadmap, scheduled to release this coming Wednesday, to get a better\nunderstanding of our plans moving forward and of the ways we intend to improve\nthe platform.\n\nClosed Beta Status\nThe “closed beta” phase refers to a round of testing we’ve run with a select\ngroup of testers from the community.

It intends on communicating in a clear and concise manner what\nBasicSwap is, what benefits one can expect from it, and how to use it.\n\nEqually as important, it is also meant to be centric in Particl’s current and\nfuture BasicSwap-related marketing efforts — serving as both a landing page and\neducational portal for any newfound curious minds.\n\nIf you want to tell others about BasicSwap, then the Particl Academy\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-dex/basicswap_explained.html] \nand BasicSwapDEX.com [http://basicswapdex.com] are the best ways to go about it!\n\nRoadmap to be Published\nBundled with the release of the website will be the publication of a\nBasicSwap-specific product roadmap. Due to the ever-evolving blockchain\nlandscape acting as a moving target, the roadmap will be presented as a set of\nnon-linear achievements for maximum flexibility and adaptability.\n\nWhat’s Next for BasicSwap?\nWhile the open beta release of BasicSwap is a major milestone in its journey,\nthe best is yet to come. Indeed, BasicSwap is poised to evolve into a major,\nunstoppable DEX platform with significant innovations that will benefit the\nentire crypto ecosystem.\n\nGenerally speaking, the team will focus on four major technical items moving\nforward, with various other additions, improvements, and fixes along the way.\n\n * SMSG 2.0 — For better scalability, privacy, and efficiency;\n * Integration frameworks — To integrate BasicSwap into third-party platforms,\n   web apps, and more;\n * Privacy-centric updates — To improve user privacy and fund security;\n * Lightning Network — For near-instant swap speed (on eligible coins) and\n   capabilities.\n\nThese are the cornerstone items of our current roadmap. They are the most\nsignificant milestones and the keys to BasicSwap’s vision. While we work on\nthese, you can expect a wide variety of non-related features and improvements to\nalso be added.\n\nAdditionally, we fully plan on adding more coins to the platform as demand for\nit comes our way. As such, we’ve set up a listing application form\n[https://forms.gle/UZhdUJAXdEumVdBi8] on our website that can be filled out to\nrequest new coin listings. Note that, due to BasicSwap’s unique architecture and\nour current development resources, we cannot guarantee a fast integration\nprocess for all coins that apply, but we’ll do our best to work with you on\nthese matters.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo there it is, the official open beta release date is now announced and mere\ndays stand before its launch! If you want to contribute to the DEX revolution\nand help take the power away from those gatekeepers best known as “centralized\nexchanges”, then help us spread the word far and wide!\n\nAs more people use decentralized exchanges, liquidity will grow, contributing to\nbringing better, more free trading conditions for all!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

Notably, its cross-chain approach radically improves the broader blockchain ecosystem, by promoting healthier and open trading conditions for all, without forcing users to use a specific coin or blockchain for monetization purposes. BasicSwap aims to take down barriers and build bridges between various cryptocurrency communities.</p><p>The BasicSwap DEX is shaped by its uncompromising dedication to five core values that are bound to be in the interest of all traders:</p><ol><li>Full custody of funds and keys;</li><li>A coin-agnostic architecture;</li><li>No trading fees or intermediary fees of any kind;</li><li>No accounts, limits, or restrictions;</li><li>Complete and total privacy.</li></ol><p>These are the five constitutional values that make up the idea behind the BasicSwap protocol, and they guide every step of the way forward.</p><h3 id=\"from-the-ground-up-uncompromising-commitment-to-privacy\">From the Ground up — Uncompromising Commitment to Privacy</h3><p>BasicSwap is certainly not the first DEX around, but it does distinguish itself in its uncompromising commitment to user privacy. When we say BasicSwap is a privacy-first DEX, it’s not just for buzz; we truly mean it.</p><p>Indeed, BasicSwap is born out of a <a href=\"https://particl.news/monero-and-particl-atomic-swaps-775f87f6208a/\"><strong>proof of concept</strong></a> made 2 years ago when the Particl team began testing <a href=\"https://github.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap\"><strong>Monero atomic swaps</strong></a>. This eventually led to the release of a rudimentary DEX protocol that used Particl’s privacy-first SMSG network, which eventually culminated into the more all-inclusive DEX platform that we see today — complete with an order book and a modern, intuitive GUI.</p><p>Suffice to say, privacy has always been at the core of BasicSwap’s history, and is its primary reason for existence. This holds true today more than ever with the planned addition of several privacy-enhancing protocols such as Taproot, SMSG 2.0, Lightning Network, and more. </p><h3 id=\"under-the-hood\">Under the Hood</h3><p>BasicSwap is made up of a unique combination of leading-edge technologies in the domains of blockchain, cryptography, and peer-to-peer networking. At no point does it use any centralized or intermediated components — ensuring the maximum level of security and privacy for all users and their hard-earned funds. Censorship, fraud, and misuse of user funds are fundamentally impossible from the application to the protocol level.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center full light-one\" id=\"btn-add_01\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"col\">\n    <div class=\"tabs\">\n      <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">Atomic Swaps</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Atomic swaps have been around for quite some time and are an important part of many DEX platforms currently available online. They allow for swapping digital assets between two users in peer-to-peer fashion, assuming that the logistical requirements behind executing such a swap exist.\n            <br><br> \n            The atomic swap technology is, in and of itself, a relatively narrow-scoped protocol: it does not match orders between two users or provide any DEX framework whatsoever. It only safely swaps assets.\n            <br><br>\n            For a properly decentralized DEX to exist, it needs a common and decentralized channel in which the information related to a swap is transferred between two parties — sometimes across two entirely different chains. Without this added layer, it is impossible for a chain to know when to release the swap in question because it isn’t directly connected to the other blockchain.\n            <br><br>\n            This is often where some so-called “DEXs” cut corners and introduce a certain level of centralization. They offer decentralized swaps, but centralize the process of matching orders which entirely defeats the purpose of being a DEX in the first place as it introduces a major central point of failure and control. In the case of BasicSwap, this process remains entirely decentralized, thanks to the SMSG network.\n            <br><br>\n            More detailed information on atomic swaps can be found \n            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Atomic_swap\">here</a>.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n        \n      <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck2\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck2\">SecureMessaging Network (SMSG)</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            SecureMessaging (SMSG) is Particl’s own custom-built and unique P2P messaging network, which stands at the core of its ecosystem. Inspired by the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.whonix.org/wiki/BitMessage\">BitMessage Protocol</a>, the SMSG network is a mixnet that acts as a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/glossary.html#term-SecureMessaging-SMSG\">decentralized storage network (DSN)</a>. As such, it stores and transfers data across nodes in a privacy-preserving manner, encrypted from end to end (E2EE), and without requiring the use of a central server.\n            <br><br>\n            This decentralized technology is essential in providing the BasicSwap DEX with functionality not provided by atomic swaps themselves, such as an order book and order matching system, as well as with transferring swap data between parties swapping from two different chains.\n            <br><br>\n            When running a BasicSwap client, you are also automatically running an SMSG node along with it. Any DEX and swap related data is then uploaded and downloaded directly from the SMSG network and interpreted by BasicSwap’s scriptless scripts, giving users a full-blown decentralized trading exchange (DEX) experience.\n            <br><br>\n            More in-depth information about the SMSG protocol can be found <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\">here</a>\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck3\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck3\">Scriptless Scripts</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Scriptless scripts are another key aspect of BasicSwap and are a largely misunderstood and overlooked feature of Bitcoin and blockchains in general. Originating from MimbleWimble, they are, in their basic sense, a way to execute secure and private smart contracts off-chain using <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature\">Schnorr Signatures</a> or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm\">ECDSA</a>.\n            <br><br>\n            In the case of BasicSwap, two people send coins on a scriptless chain and into an address that's created from the sum of one private key from each of them.

These details include the number and addresses of participants and the amounts transferred, among other metadata. But because scriptless scripts are essentially smart contracts operating off-chain, most of the usage data and user information is NOT shared with the rest of the network. The only thing that the network knows is that certain individuals are interacting with a smart contract according to its pre-defined rules. However, depending on the specific implementation, it is also possible for that information to be completely hidden.\n            <br><br>\n            <b>Scalability:</b> Smart contracts take up a lot of space on a blockchain.

Notably, its cross-chain approach radically improves the broader blockchain ecosystem, by promoting healthier and open trading conditions for all, without forcing users to use a specific coin or blockchain for monetization purposes. BasicSwap aims to take down barriers and build bridges between various cryptocurrency communities.</p><p>The BasicSwap DEX is shaped by its uncompromising dedication to five core values that are bound to be in the interest of all traders:</p><ol><li>Full custody of funds and keys;</li><li>A coin-agnostic architecture;</li><li>No trading fees or intermediary fees of any kind;</li><li>No accounts, limits, or restrictions;</li><li>Complete and total privacy.</li></ol><p>These are the five constitutional values that make up the idea behind the BasicSwap protocol, and they guide every step of the way forward.</p><h3 id=\"from-the-ground-up-uncompromising-commitment-to-privacy\">From the Ground up — Uncompromising Commitment to Privacy</h3><p>BasicSwap is certainly not the first DEX around, but it does distinguish itself in its uncompromising commitment to user privacy. When we say BasicSwap is a privacy-first DEX, it’s not just for buzz; we truly mean it.</p><p>Indeed, BasicSwap is born out of a <a href=\"https://particl.news/monero-and-particl-atomic-swaps-775f87f6208a/\"><strong>proof of concept</strong></a> made 2 years ago when the Particl team began testing <a href=\"https://github.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap\"><strong>Monero atomic swaps</strong></a>. This eventually led to the release of a rudimentary DEX protocol that used Particl’s privacy-first SMSG network, which eventually culminated into the more all-inclusive DEX platform that we see today — complete with an order book and a modern, intuitive GUI.</p><p>Suffice to say, privacy has always been at the core of BasicSwap’s history, and is its primary reason for existence. This holds true today more than ever with the planned addition of several privacy-enhancing protocols such as Taproot, SMSG 2.0, Lightning Network, and more. </p><h3 id=\"under-the-hood\">Under the Hood</h3><p>BasicSwap is made up of a unique combination of leading-edge technologies in the domains of blockchain, cryptography, and peer-to-peer networking. At no point does it use any centralized or intermediated components — ensuring the maximum level of security and privacy for all users and their hard-earned funds. Censorship, fraud, and misuse of user funds are fundamentally impossible from the application to the protocol level.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center full light-one\" id=\"btn-add_01\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"col\">\n    <div class=\"tabs\">\n      <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">Atomic Swaps</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Atomic swaps have been around for quite some time and are an important part of many DEX platforms currently available online. They allow for swapping digital assets between two users in peer-to-peer fashion, assuming that the logistical requirements behind executing such a swap exist.\n            <br><br> \n            The atomic swap technology is, in and of itself, a relatively narrow-scoped protocol: it does not match orders between two users or provide any DEX framework whatsoever. It only safely swaps assets.\n            <br><br>\n            For a properly decentralized DEX to exist, it needs a common and decentralized channel in which the information related to a swap is transferred between two parties — sometimes across two entirely different chains. Without this added layer, it is impossible for a chain to know when to release the swap in question because it isn’t directly connected to the other blockchain.\n            <br><br>\n            This is often where some so-called “DEXs” cut corners and introduce a certain level of centralization. They offer decentralized swaps, but centralize the process of matching orders which entirely defeats the purpose of being a DEX in the first place as it introduces a major central point of failure and control. In the case of BasicSwap, this process remains entirely decentralized, thanks to the SMSG network.\n            <br><br>\n            More detailed information on atomic swaps can be found \n            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Atomic_swap\">here</a>.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n        \n      <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck2\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck2\">SecureMessaging Network (SMSG)</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            SecureMessaging (SMSG) is Particl’s own custom-built and unique P2P messaging network, which stands at the core of its ecosystem. Inspired by the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.whonix.org/wiki/BitMessage\">BitMessage Protocol</a>, the SMSG network is a mixnet that acts as a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/glossary.html#term-SecureMessaging-SMSG\">decentralized storage network (DSN)</a>. As such, it stores and transfers data across nodes in a privacy-preserving manner, encrypted from end to end (E2EE), and without requiring the use of a central server.\n            <br><br>\n            This decentralized technology is essential in providing the BasicSwap DEX with functionality not provided by atomic swaps themselves, such as an order book and order matching system, as well as with transferring swap data between parties swapping from two different chains.\n            <br><br>\n            When running a BasicSwap client, you are also automatically running an SMSG node along with it. Any DEX and swap related data is then uploaded and downloaded directly from the SMSG network and interpreted by BasicSwap’s scriptless scripts, giving users a full-blown decentralized trading exchange (DEX) experience.\n            <br><br>\n            More in-depth information about the SMSG protocol can be found <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\">here</a>\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck3\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck3\">Scriptless Scripts</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Scriptless scripts are another key aspect of BasicSwap and are a largely misunderstood and overlooked feature of Bitcoin and blockchains in general. Originating from MimbleWimble, they are, in their basic sense, a way to execute secure and private smart contracts off-chain using <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature\">Schnorr Signatures</a> or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm\">ECDSA</a>.\n            <br><br>\n            In the case of BasicSwap, two people send coins on a scriptless chain and into an address that's created from the sum of one private key from each of them. That way, to spend that output requires them to cooperate through <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L154\">One-Time Verifiably Encrypted Signatures (OtVES)</a>.\n            <br><br>\n            <i></i></p><blockquote cite=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L156\"><i>\"A One-Time VES is a signature made invalid by mixing it with the public key of an encrypting key pair, a valid signature can be decrypted with knowledge of the private encrypting key and the private encrypting key can be recovered with knowledge of both the encrypted and plaintext signatures.\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L156\">Tecnovert — xmrswap protocol notes</a> </i></blockquote>\n            <br><br>\n            Compared to traditional on-chain smart contracts, scriptless scripts provide added privacy and scalability. And compared to the rigid and barebone Bitcoin smart contracts, they add a ton of functionality by allowing for much more complex and flexible, yet still securely tight, smart contracts.\n            <br><br>\n            <b>Privacy:</b> When on-chain, many details of a smart contract are shared to the entire network. These details include the number and addresses of participants and the amounts transferred, among other metadata. But because scriptless scripts are essentially smart contracts operating off-chain, most of the usage data and user information is NOT shared with the rest of the network. The only thing that the network knows is that certain individuals are interacting with a smart contract according to its pre-defined rules. However, depending on the specific implementation, it is also possible for that information to be completely hidden.\n            <br><br>\n            <b>Scalability:</b> Smart contracts take up a lot of space on a blockchain. By moving the smart contracting process off-chain, that data does not fill up and bloat the blockchain, leading to much better scalability. The smart contracting process is also shared between scriptless scripts themselves and the SMSG network.\n            <br><br>\n            Additionally, because scriptless scripts are eventually intended to leverage Schnorr Signatures, multiple keys can be aggregated into a single one — making the actual smart contract code much lighter and more efficient than traditional on-chain smart contracts.\n            <p></p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    </div><!-- tabs close-->\n  </div><!-- col close-->\n</div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id=\"open-beta-release-information\">Open Beta Release Information</h2><p>On <strong>08/12/2022 at 15:00 UTC</strong>, BasicSwap’s open beta goes live, on mainnet, for everyone.

But, again, there's nothing complicated there,\njust time, so that should only take a handful of days.\n\nThen, we'll run a few internal tests, after which we'll be ready to go live with\nParticl Desktop 3.3 on testnet.\n\nRemaining Items for Particl Desktop 3.3\n 1. (In progress) We are in the process of re-adding the new\n    marketplace-specific code into Particl Desktop.\n 2. (Pending) A couple of general but minor tweaks and minor\n    improvements/optimizations need to be done, but they are negligible in terms\n    of effort to sort out.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As usual, we've been\nkeeping up with upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain\nParticl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version.

These issues are minor in nature, and none of them could\n   have led to a loss of funds or other similar critical consequences!

Here's what we can report so far.\n\n * BasicSwap's GUI is very stable and has seen very few bugs. What's been\n   identified is currently being fixed and tested simultaneously.\n * We've received some good feedback and suggestions regarding the user\n   interface, which we're also adding while fixing the aforementioned bugs. We\n   will soon be pushing the v0.1.1 version of the GUI to the closed beta group.\n * Just as with its GUI, we've received good feedback and comments regarding the\n   BasicSwap codebase. Although no bug, properly speaking, has been found, this\n   closed beta round does an excellent job of highlighting future priorities and\n   some of the most pressing improvements or additions. We fully expect the open\n   beta to help even further on that note.\n * One recurrent comment is regarding the building process of the application,\n   which may appear more or less complicated for some users. To that effect,\n   we've prepared easy-to-follow step-by-step guides on the entire process which\n   will be published on the Particl Academy in due time. We're also\n   investigating different ways to automate and simplify that process,\n   potentially via all-inclusive executables or similar solutions.\n * For security purposes, the future development path envisions the BasicSwap\n   protocol (i.e., nodes) and individual coin cores running isolated from each\n   other. However, in this beta stage, the tradeoff for that enhanced security\n   is reduced usability as we have to design the system to function in a more\n   isolated way.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

While the work continues, it is now progressing\nat a steady pace.\n\nNew \"Core\" section redirects to the newly-added Core-related settings (UI/UX is\na WIP)Now for a bit more information on the screenshot above.\n\n 1. Clicking on the \"Core\" button brings up the core configuration screen,\n    allowing the user to change various core-related settings. Things like\n    connection details (URL, whether to use the core cookie file for\n    authentication or provided RPC user/password, etc.), whether to start core\n    on PD startup or not, which network to connect to (mainnet, testnet, or\n    regtest), proxy details (i.e., Tor), etc. Those are generally saved in an\n    app-specific (wallet, market, etc.) JSON file, meaning that one can script\n    the download, configuration, and startup of Particl Desktop for specific\n    environments such as Whonix, for example.\n 2. In the screenshot, the core status message below the buttons shows that core\n    is connected. If core was not already connected, then the other buttons\n    would not be active. In other words, one cannot open the marketplace unless\n    core is actively running.\n 3. A new icon in the sidebar allows the user to navigate back to the welcome\n    screen from anywhere. Currently, it looks like a hamburger menu icon, but\n    we'll change it to a more comprehensible icon before the release.\n\nWhile the back-end changes are now complete, integrating them into the user\ninterface is our current main and final desktop-related deliverable before we\ncan go live with PD 3.3. Of course, as is always the case with larger releases,\nwe'll run a testnet round before the mainnet deployment.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As usual, we've been\nkeeping up with upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain\nParticl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version.

the last step before the public release of\nthe open beta, so make sure to read this blog post in full to get all the\ndetails and get a better idea of what to expect in the next few days to come!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat is BasicSwap?\nBasicSwap — The Fully Private Cross-Chain DEXMatch and settle cryptocurrency\ntrades in a trustless setup without any central point of failure or fee.Particl\nNewscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/]BasicSwap is\na cross-chain and private decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol and a trading\napp that allows you to swap one cryptocurrency for another without any middleman\nor third-party being involved.\n\nIt lets you make or take orders on a distributed order book and execute swaps\nthat are safe, trustless, unrestricted, and private. All of this combined sets\nBasicSwap apart as a DEX with uncompromising ease of use, security and\ndecentralization, and creates an environment that is totally free of any central\npoint of failure. Best of all: there are absolutely no trading fees!\n\nWe’ve already published an extensive blog post explaining everything you need\nto\nknow about BasicSwap\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/]. So if you\nwant more information on this upcoming breakthrough DEX, make sure to give it a\nread!\n\nAbout BasicSwap’s User Interface\nAs you may already be aware, the BasicSwap back-end protocol (\"swap engine\") has\nbeen operational as an early beta software for a while, allowing mainnet swaps\nto take place between a range of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin,\nParticl and even Monero.\n\nHowever, what it lacked, up until today, was a user-friendly and easy-to-use\ninterface to facilitate the act of trading on the platform. As we’ve often seen\nwithin the blockchain industry, the user experience is of the utmost importance.\n\nThat’s why we’ve opted to wait until BasicSwap’s user-friendly GUI was ready\nbefore publicly releasing the beta. And now that this is done, we enter a new\nphase for BasicSwap!\n\nThe Final Closed Beta Testing Round Begins Today\nWith the first version of the BasicSwap GUI now completed (v0.1), we have now\nbegun the final closed beta testing round before the public launch of the open\nbeta.\n\nDuring this final round, we’ll thoroughly test the user interface across a wide\nrange of environments and scenarios as well as the DEX protocol itself. This\nwill ensure the smoothest and most hassle-free open beta launch (public)\npossible.\n\nWhat’s BasicSwap’s Status?\nBasicSwap is a beta product and still under development. The release of the open\nbeta is a major milestone in its development but it is by no means a completed\nproduct.\n\nAs such, there may be missing features, quirks in the user experience, and areas\nof improvement. This is normal at this stage, and that’s precisely where we need\nyou!\n\nIf, during the upcoming open beta, you encounter any issue, bug, or discover\nareas of improvements, be sure to let us know by logging it on the DEX’s issue\npage [https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/issues].

That’s because\nit is highly dependent on how the final closed beta testing round goes.\n\nHowever, we don’t expect that testing period to last for a long time. We’ll be\nsure to communicate clearly the launch date a few days before.\n\nHow Can I Support the Upcoming Open Beta Launch?\nAs the open beta launch approaches rapidly, there are a few things you can\nalready do to pre-emptively help out.\n\nFirst and foremost, BasicSwap uses an order book system to match traders\ntogether rather than a single liquidity pool. That means its user experience\ndepends in major part on the liquidity available on the books.\n\nAs such, putting liquidity on BasicSwap when it releases not only grants you\naccess to a healthier trading environment on which you can trade, but it also\nhelps others match their trades, making BasicSwap a more viable solution for all\nand, in turn, bringing more liquidity as a result.\n\nSimilarly to putting liquidity on the books, every attempt at getting the word\nout also helps immensely. Whether that be to friends, in your online\ncommunities, on Reddit or crypto Twitter, any place is a good place to let\nothers, who may benefit from what BasicSwap has to offer, know about it.\n\nA DEX thrives the bigger its user base is; we all win by bringing more people to\nBasicSwap and providing liquidity!\n\nBasicSwap Website About to Go Live\nTo support the public launch of BasicSwap’s beta and help others better\nunderstand how the platform benefits them, we will launch a new website entirely\ndedicated to BasicSwap. This will be an incredibly useful tool that will make it\neasier to share with others what vital benefits they can get for using a\nproperly decentralized and privacy-focused trading platform.\n\nThe launch of the BasicSwap website is planned for before the launch of the open\nbeta.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA better, more private, and fair-to-all trading environment looms and there’s no\nturning back!\n\nAs always, we will keep you posted about it through our weekly development\nprogress reports available on Particl News.

This means\nupdating everything that depends on those changes and then potentially updating\nany code that depends on that functionality, and so on.\n\nThis integration process is now the main desktop-related task and the last one\nbefore we can release Particl Desktop 3.3 (aside from any testing, as usual).\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As usual, we've been\nkeeping up with upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain\nParticl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version.

We'd like to implement a couple of extra minor items, such as\nlogging outputs from the front end to the Particl Desktop log file, but we will\nprioritize other more pressing deliverables first. In any case, we expect it to\nbe pretty simple and straightforward to implement when needed.\n\nFor now, we're in the process of re-evaluating some changes on the front end to\nintegrate these new changes neatly in a user-friendly way. Although that is not\nexpected to be a challenging task, it is relatively tedious as we now need to\nremove a wide variety of long-standing implementations to the GUI that we've\ncarried for several desktop versions. That means updating everything that\ndepends on those changes and then potentially updating any code that depends on\nthat functionality, and so on.\n\nSo, generally speaking, everything is continuing along and seeing steady\nprogress.

So let's quickly see what progress has been made in the past\nfew days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop\nAs has been the case for the past few updates, we're still working through\nincrementally separating Particl Core from Particl Desktop and, by the same\nprocess, adding more user configuration options to the desktop client.\n\nAs we've mentioned in previous progress reports, this is a large but essential\nstep as we move ahead with Particl's upcoming development cycle\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/] which transforms\nthe ecosystem's architecture with a modular approach.\n\nParticl Core\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As usual, we've been\nkeeping up with upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain\nParticl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. You can always keep track\nof those changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nInvestigating a Node Issue ?\nEarlier today, we observed some cases of staking nodes getting stuck at a\nprevious block and not staking anymore. We are currently investigating the\nissue, but in the meantime, please check your node(s) to ensure that they are\n(1) staking correctly and (2) on the latest block (you can verify the current\nblock number here [https://explorer.particl.io/] or directly using Partyman's \npartyman/partyman status command.\n\nIf your node appears out of sync, you can fix the problem by simply restarting\nit. On Partyman, you can do this by typing partyman/partyman restart. If you're\nusing Particl Qt or Particl Desktop, close the application completely and\nre-open it.\n\n> Note: After restarting, make sure that your node successfully syncs to the\nlatest block. In rare cases, it may take a couple of restarts for this to\nhappen.\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week, we've completed the important process of building a standardized way\nto integrate certain Bitcoin-based cryptocurrencies into BasicSwap. However, we\nhaven't tested the entire process on mainnet yet, which we'll be doing over the\ncourse of next week.\n\nOnce ready, it'll make it much easier and faster to integrate various\ncryptocurrencies that meet certain criteria for cross-chain swapping. This will\nhelp the Particl team work through integrations faster and let other projects\nbuild their own coin integrations.\n\nBasicSwap Front-end ?\nWe've also been making steady progress on the finalization and testing of\nBasicSwap's GUI in preparation for the open beta launch. Here's a summary of\nwhat we've completed, fixed, or improved to the user interface this week.\n\n 1. Updated the error/confirm modals\n 2. Finished most templates for the order book tables\n 3. Tested the GUI across multiple browsers\n 4. Added a \"mobile-friendly\" menu for small resolution screens and mobile\n    devices (requires browsing to the IP address of your local BasicSwap\n    instance for now) \n 5. Improved some parts of the https_server\n 6. Wrapped up the intro page\n 7. Fixed a variety of bugs and issues with the user interface\n\nVote for Team Proposal Ongoing ?\nTeam Funding Proposal #3Learn all the details about the Particl team’s third\nfunding request from the Treasury Fund.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/team-funding-proposal-3/]This Wednesday, the voting round\nfor the Particl team's 3rd funding proposal\n[https://particl.news/team-funding-proposal-3/] has started and is currently\nongoing. The vote is expected to end roughly this coming Wednesday.\n\nYou can vote by following the step-by-step instructions available here\n[https://particl.wiki/tutorial/staking/how-to-vote/]. To monitor the results in\nreal-time, you can either open up the Governance app on Particl Desktop or use\nthe partyman/partyman proposal tally command on Partyman (tally votes for\nproposal 11).\n\nFinally, to verify that you are voting correctly, you can use the votehistory \ncommand on Particl Desktop and Particl Qt, and ~/particlcore/particl-cli\nvotehistory on Partyman. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

So let's quickly see what progress has been made in the past\nfew days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nAs has been the case for the past few updates, we're still working through\nincrementally separating Particl Core from Particl Desktop and, by the same\nprocess, adding more user configuration options to the desktop client. \n\nAs we've mentioned in previous progress reports, this is a large but essential\nstep as we move ahead with Particl's upcoming development cycle\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/] which transforms\nthe ecosystem's architecture with a modular approach.\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Update\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As usual, we've been\nkeeping up with upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain\nParticl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. You can always keep track\nof those changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week, we've been exploring the integration of certain coins on BasicSwap.\nWe're working on preparing example commits showing other projects which may want\nto integrate their coins onto BasicSwap how to do it themselves. However,\nBasicSwap's true cross-chain nature makes it impossible to have a\none-size-fits-all coin integration solution. Still, the example commits we're\nworking on will nonetheless be able to facilitate the integration process of a\ndecent number of coins.\n\nAdditionally, we've made significant progress on the DEX's GUI. We're currently\nworking through a few issues and adding improvements as we test it before\nreleasing publicly. But, just as a small end-of-week teaser, here is what the\ncurrent order book page looks like!\n\nListing Seeding Proposal Progress Update\nIt seems like we're long overdue for an update on the listing seeding proposal!\nAs it stands right now, we've got two short-term priorities related to Particl\nDesktop and the marketplace:\n\n * Completing the Particl Desktop 3.3 changes and releasing it\n * Deploying the listing seeding system\n\nAnd while we're currently primarily focused on the changes related to Particl\nDesktop 3.3, we've already begun working on the listing seeding proposal's\ndeliverable, notably by adding product codes in the last Particl Desktop update,\nwhich is a requirement for an improved, more complete vision we have for this\nproposal. But what is this \"improved vision\"?\n\nListing Seeding Proposal 2.0\nSince we've published the original listing seeding proposal, many things have\nchanged around the Particl project, especially considering last week's major\nannouncement of an evolutionary leap forward for the ecosystem\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/].\n\nFor this reason, we've re-imagined what we intend to deliver for the proposal so\nthat it fits better with this new direction and have designed a more complete\nand open system that will drastically improve the life of Particl sellers — not\njust populate the marketplace with listings.\n\nAs opposed to building a relatively closed system for the exclusive purpose of\nseeding listings on the marketplace, we're now opting to build an open \"power\nseller\" standalone application intended to be released publicly.\n\nThis system will act as an external, advanced inventory and order management\ntool built for power Particl sellers. This will open up a ton of opportunities\nfor sellers by giving them access to more advanced capabilities. Notably, you\ncan expect most or all standard seller features to be available, such as the\nability to easily create, manage and publish listings as well as up escrow\nparameters, manage shipping, orders, and even chat conversations outside of\nParticl Desktop.\n\nBut, to complement these functionalities, sellers will be able to automate a lot\nof the typical seller-related processes such as automatically relisting\nmarketplace items, accepting and processing orders according to set preferences,\nand etc. When properly set up, it will allow sellers run their shops almost on\nauto-pilot and will dramatically reduce the time it requires to manage large\nseller accounts on Particl.\n\nAnother key function of this system will be in how it connects a seller\ninventory to a WooCommerce store (and, eventually, additional external platforms\nas we march through the upcoming development cycle). The main benefit here is\nthe ability to install and use a wide variety of WooCommerce plugins (i.e., an\nautomated dropshipping system like Dropified). This will grant sellers many more\noptions than ever before on Particl Marketplace, a taste of what's to be\npossible with Particl's new modular and open architecture.\n\n> Note: The system will be released with incremental feature updates.\nDeploying a Mobile Version of the Marketplace Quicker\nOne of the main reasons we've opted to change the design of the listing seeding\nproposal is to be able to release a buyer-focused mobile version of the\nmarketplace\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward#new-particl-dapps-are-coming-around] \nmuch quicker. That way, there is no requirement to wait for the full version of\nthe improved marketplace to be ready before we can start releasing new products.\n\nIndeed, because the first few versions of the upcoming mobile version of the\nmarketplace will be exclusively buyer-focused, sellers still need to be able to\npublish listings for buyers to buy. And since listings posted on the current\nversion of the marketplace won't show up on the new version (because the\ncodebases will be vastly different), there needs to be a way for sellers to\npublish listings while we build the full version of the marketplace.\n\nAnd that's where the listing seeding tool comes in handy. It will let sellers\nsell their products and services on the new version of the marketplace while we\nincrementally build the full version (on desktop and web). In other words, we'll\nuse this tool as an intermediary for sellers, allowing us to deploy the\nbuyer-focused mobile version of the marketplace more quickly and keep things\nmoving smoothly.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

As it stands right now, we've got two short-term priorities related to Particl Desktop and the marketplace:</p><ul><li>Completing the Particl Desktop 3.3 changes and releasing it</li><li>Deploying the listing seeding system</li></ul><p>And while we're currently primarily focused on the changes related to Particl Desktop 3.3, we've already begun working on the listing seeding proposal's deliverable, notably by adding product codes in the last Particl Desktop update, which is a requirement for an improved, more complete vision we have for this proposal. But what is this \"improved vision\"?</p><h3 id=\"listing-seeding-proposal-2-0\">Listing Seeding Proposal 2.0</h3><p>Since we've published the original listing seeding proposal, many things have changed around the Particl project, especially considering <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/\">last week's major announcement of an evolutionary leap forward for the ecosystem</a>.</p><p>For this reason, <strong>we've re-imagined what we intend to deliver for the proposal</strong> so that it fits better with this new direction and have designed a more complete and open system that will drastically improve the life of Particl sellers — not just populate the marketplace with listings.</p><p>As opposed to building a relatively closed system for the exclusive purpose of seeding listings on the marketplace, we're now opting to build an open \"power seller\" standalone application intended to be released publicly.</p><p>This system will act as an external, advanced inventory and order management tool built for power Particl sellers. This will open up a ton of opportunities for sellers by giving them access to more advanced capabilities. Notably, you can expect most or all standard seller features to be available, such as the ability to easily create, manage and publish listings as well as up escrow parameters, manage shipping, orders, and even chat conversations outside of Particl Desktop.</p><p>But, to complement these functionalities, sellers will be able to automate a lot of the typical seller-related processes such as automatically relisting marketplace items, accepting and processing orders according to set preferences, and etc. When properly set up, it will allow sellers run their shops almost on auto-pilot and will dramatically reduce the time it requires to manage large seller accounts on Particl.</p><p>Another key function of this system will be in how it connects a seller inventory to a WooCommerce store (and, eventually, additional external platforms as we march through the upcoming development cycle). The main benefit here is the ability to install and use a wide variety of WooCommerce plugins (i.e., an automated dropshipping system like Dropified). This will grant sellers many more options than ever before on Particl Marketplace, a taste of what's to be possible with Particl's new modular and open architecture.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> The system will be released with incremental feature updates.</em></blockquote><h3 id=\"deploying-a-mobile-version-of-the-marketplace-quicker\">Deploying a Mobile Version of the Marketplace Quicker</h3><p>One of the main reasons we've opted to change the design of the listing seeding proposal is to be able to release a <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward#new-particl-dapps-are-coming-around\">buyer-focused mobile version of the marketplace</a> much quicker. That way, there is no requirement to wait for the full version of the improved marketplace to be ready before we can start releasing new products.</p><p>Indeed, because the first few versions of the upcoming mobile version of the marketplace will be exclusively buyer-focused, sellers still need to be able to publish listings for buyers to buy. And since listings posted on the current version of the marketplace won't show up on the new version (because the codebases will be vastly different), there needs to be a way for sellers to publish listings while we build the full version of the marketplace.</p><p>And that's where the listing seeding tool comes in handy. It will let sellers sell their products and services on the new version of the marketplace while we incrementally build the full version (on desktop and web). In other words, we'll use this tool as an intermediary for sellers, allowing us to deploy the buyer-focused mobile version of the marketplace more quickly and keep things moving smoothly.</p><hr><p>As always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and what it's working towards achieving.

It will improve the ecosystem from all angles, making\nit more accessible, user-friendly, and flexible than ever.\n\nThis will result in a suite of easy-to-use and very accessible privacy-first\napplications that anybody can use — bringing uncompromising privacy, liberty,\nand independence into the lives of as many people as ever.\n\nIn many ways, calling this new cycle a major leap forward for Particl would be\nan understatement. The benefits will extend far beyond the Particl community!\n\nTable of Contents\n * The State of our Digital World\n * Announcing Particl’s New Major Development Cycle\n * Particl's Four Pillars for the New Digital World\n * —— 1.

With the web now having\nsuch a prevalent place in our society, this crisis ends up bleeding into every\nsingle aspect of our lives — it affects not only our finances but also our\nprivate communications, our personal and professional lives, and our ability to\ndo almost anything online.\n\nGone are the days of what once was a free and open web. Instead, as we’ve\nrecently explored in various Particl Stories [https://particl.news/tag/stories/]\n, there is a worryingly increasing trend in the rate of censorship, \ngeo-political meddling\n[https://particl.news/unhosted-wallets-and-the-fight-against-out-of-touch-policies/]\n, big tech abuses\n[https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/], \nreckless data mining\n[https://particl.news/the-need-for-an-open-source-revolution/], and various\nagenda-driven actions by the Internet’s largest platform operators.\n\nUndoubtedly, we, as individuals, need to stand up to this takeover and take back\ncontrol of our web. We need to reassert and safeguard our rights to an open,\nfree, and private web environment, as it was originally intended to be, and be\nthe change we want to see in this world!\n\nWhereas certain governments, corporations, or other types of organizations\ncontinue to elevate their level of control and power using the current web\ninfrastructure, there is a growing need to stop fighting on their own turf and,\ninstead, pioneer the digital world of tomorrow in which the rights and freedoms\nof each individual are guaranteed.\n\nWhen accessible and easy to use, disruptive technology — as is the case with\nParticl’s privacy-first dApps — becomes both a shield and a weapon, protecting\nus from digital abuse but also striking back by allowing people to thrive\nwithout interference from the current centralized web infrastructure.\n\nThe Shortcomings of Web3\nThat is, in essence, what Web3 promised to accomplish: a more open, independent,\nand free internet for all. Unfortunately, as we’ve come to discover\n[https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/], what Web3 promises and\nwhat it currently delivers diverges on many fronts. If you dive into its present\nstate, you can see that it’s much more centralized than it first appears —\nrelying, in major parts, on traditional “big tech” infrastructure — and that it\nturns out to be a near disaster in terms of privacy and decentralization.\n\nWeb3 Exposed! Is it Only a Mirage?A cold hard and in-depth look into the\npromises and current realities of “Web3”.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/]Web3, and by association\nDeFi as well, offers a level of financial privacy that is ultimately lower than\neven the traditional banking system. On the latter, only a few parties can\naccess your financial information. That would typically be your bank or the\npayment processor you’re using, government organizations, and their partners.\nWith Web3 services, your financial data, while pseudonymous, is permanently and\npublicly stored for the whole world to see. Anyone curious enough can simply\nlook for the entirety of your information in public records.\n\nCase in point, here are the financial assets of a random public Ethereum user\n[https://debank.com/profile/0xb432863b3857f1cd9d78f5856a8d20693a8bc1a0?chain=eth]\n, their detailed financial history\n[https://etherscan.io/address/0xb432863b3857f1cd9d78f5856a8d20693a8bc1a0], as\nwell as all the NFTs they own\n[https://debank.com/profile/0xb432863b3857f1cd9d78f5856a8d20693a8bc1a0/nft?chain=eth]\n. And while we’ve simply picked a random user that had just traded on Uniswap at\nthe time of this writing, the totality of their financial information is\npermanently out in the open. Anyone that then sends payments to that address is\nable to track, down to the cent, the totality of its owner’s past, present, and\nfuture financial activities; a terrible foundation from which to build the\n“economy or internet of tomorrow”.\n\nWhat’s more, not all Web3 apps are as decentralized and open as they claim, such\nas we’ve seen with Infura, MetaMask\n[https://medium.com/coinmonks/as-metamask-and-opensea-abide-by-us-sanctions-the-russian-ban-is-in-the-spotlight-67611df121f8]\n, and various other dApps that use their services like the not-so-decentralized \nNFT marketplace OpenSea\n[https://cryptobriefing.com/metamask-opensea-blocks-expose-centralization-in-web3/]\n.\n\nWith so many similar examples recently in mind, It’s difficult to see Web3\nsucceed on its stated mission when its biggest and most popular apps end up not\nliving up to their promises at best and, at worst, significantly eroding online\nprivacy and security compared to even Web2.\n\nIn reality, the main problem doesn’t stem from Web3 as a basic concept but\nrather from its poor implementation of the principles required to fulfill its\nmission; a lack of vision from some of Web3’s leaders, or in other cases, the\nsheer pursuit of fast profit, leads to cutting corners and sacrificing the most\ncritical foundations of Web3.\n\nIndeed, it is deluded to think fighting the centralization of powers on the web\ncan be done by building apps and services with less privacy than on traditional\nweb infrastructure or hosting them on said outdated infrastructure. Yet, it\nunfortunately appears to be the direction that Web3 is headed towards.\n\nParticl’s next development cycle is all about steering this ship in the right\ndirection.\n\nBuilding the Right Foundation\nParticl’s new development cycle is about steering Web3 in the right direction by\ngranting it a truly independent and resilient foundation on which privacy-first\ndecentralized applications can be deployed.\n\nBy leveraging the firepower of an ever-growing community of Web3 pioneers\n[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/electric-capital/developer-reports/master/dev_report_2021_updated_012622.pdf] \nand giving them tools that follow a privacy-first approach, a decentralized and\nopen-source alternative to the traditional web infrastructure can be built to\nfight back against the centralization of powers. It is up to all of us to create\na parallel and independent environment that puts individuals at the center —\nsimultaneously armed and shielded with privacy-first dApps — and liberates them\nfrom the ever-tightening noose that is the centralization of powers online and\nall the consequences it brings forth.\n\nAnnouncing Particl’s New Major Development Cycle\nIn a nutshell, Particl’s new development cycle focuses on expanding the\necosystem’s strengths and endowing it with a new, modular infrastructure,\nultimately building a solid foundation on which to easily build and use\nprivacy-first dApps.\n\nBefore we go into further details on this new development cycle, it’s important\nto understand the reasoning behind the journey ahead by first being aware of\nParticl’s strengths and what makes it unique.\n\nWhat Makes Particl Unique?\nParticl is a revolutionary and powerful ecosystem like none other thanks to a\nunique combination of two core components: Particl Blockchain and the\nSecureMessaging network (SMSG).\n\nParticl Blockchain \nThe Particl Blockchain is a unique and powerful blockchain that contains both\nvarious privacy-preserving features (CT, RingCT, stealth addresses, Taproot,\netc) as well as a high level of flexibility.\n\nWhile its native cryptocurrency, PART, allows for untraceable payments to be\nmade (privacy coin)\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd/], the\nblockchain infrastructure allows for the creation of complex, decentralized, and\nprivacy-first applications through the use of smart contracts and scriptless\nscripts (off-chain, private, and scalable smart contracts). This unique\nconvergence of privacy capabilities and application flexibility allows for the\nParticl Blockchain to carve a niche of its own within the blockchain industry\nwith an uncompromising focus on “privacy-first dApps”, such as Particl \nMarketplace [https://particl.io/marketplace] or BasicSwap DEX\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/].\n\n> Note: Although the concept of smart contracts is well known to most people\nwithin the cryptocurrency community, scriptless scripts, on the other hand, tend\nto be less widely known. You can learn more about them here\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex#scriptless-scripts] \nor by reading this in-depth guide\n[https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/introduction-to-scriptless-scripts].\nSecureMessaging Network (SMSG)\nSecureMessaging (SMSG) is a P2P mixnet that allows peers to communicate\nencrypted data with other peers or applications without the need for third\nparties or middlemen. Inspired by the BitMessage protocol\n[https://www.whonix.org/wiki/BitMessage], it stores and transfers data across\nnodes in a privacy-preserving manner, encrypted from end to end (E2EE).\n\nIn other words, SMSG is a decentralized messaging layer that both dApps and\nusers themselves can use. Its usage enables the creation and deployment of much\nmore complex decentralized applications than what can be done using smart\ncontracts exclusively. You can read more on the SMSG network here\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/].\n\nParticl's Four Pillars for the New Digital World\nParticl's unique combination of a private and flexible blockchain with a\ndecentralized mixnet makes possible the creation of advanced privacy-first dApps\nthat protect the rights and liberties of its users.\n\nCompared to the majority of Web3, Particl dApps are a major improvement in terms\nof the values they are committed to. We must capitalize on that potential for\nthe good of not only the project but also the well-being of the internet and\nsociety as a whole.\n\nThe strategic plan to make all of this happen is fourfold:\n\n 1. Deploy a new, more powerful mixnet to expand on the network's capabilities\n    (already well in its conceptualization phase, tentatively named \"SMSG 2.0\")\n 2. Transform Particl into a modular and development-friendly infrastructure\n 3. Deploy new \"access gateways\" (i.e., web, mobile, and SMSG frameworks) to\n    host decentralized applications and interact with them\n 4. Commit as much as possible to an agnostic philosophy\n\nLet's explore these four central aspects of Particl's new strategic plan in more\ndetail.\n\n1. SMSG 2.0 — A Decentralized and Private Internet Protocol\nA big reason why Particl dApps are so unique is due to them leveraging the data\ntransmission and storage capabilities of the SMSG network\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/], which\nruns in parallel but independently to Particl Blockchain nodes. This makes\npossible more advanced features and functionality than traditional\nsmart-contract dApps, as is the case with both the Particl Marketplace and\nBasicSwap DEX dApps.\n\nThe SMSG Network — Enabling Dapps With True PrivacyLearn more about what makes\nParticl decentralized applications truly special and private!Particl News\ncryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/]But\nwhile the SMSG network offers pristine privacy and a very secure, trustless way\nto communicate data between peers, it is not scalable enough to support massive\nlevels of simultaneous usage.\n\nAdditionally, it only allows for data transmission and temporary storage, making\nit more akin to a messaging protocol rather than a fully-fledged internet\ninfrastructure.\n\nAnd so, the first fold of Particl’s new strategic plan is to re-imagine SMSG to\nmake it more scalable and allow for even more advanced functionality —\nessentially doubling down on its strengths and expanding on its use-cases.\n\nAn Open and Decentralized Web Architecture\nTo get groundbreaking results, you sometimes need to think outside the box. It\nis true that the current version of SMSG provides the privacy and capabilities\nwe need to build privacy-first dApps — however, it is limited in terms of how\nmuch usage the network can sustain. Furthermore, updating its current code\nimplementation would only result in marginal scalability improvements due to the\nway it is built.\n\nThat’s why a completely new version of SMSG, built from scratch and with the\nmission of serving as the foundation for the new internet, is required.\n\nDistributed Web Content and dApp Hosting\nA critical new functionality SMSG requires is the ability to not only store data\nbut also host and allow for direct interaction with web content and dApps —\nentirely independently from any traditional web infrastructure (the “world wide\nweb”).\n\nTo put it another way, this major functionality update amounts to transforming\nSMSG from a messaging network into a fully decentralized, independent, free, and\nprivacy-first internet protocol that’s open to all, without restrictions.\n\nWith dApps and web content hosted on — and accessible from — this distributed\nnetwork, it provides a viable alternative for people to opt out completely of\nour current internet infrastructure, which has grown corrupted and toxic over\nthe past few decades. Plus, content and dApps hosted on it become entirely\ncensorship-proof as the decentralized nature of this network shields them from\nany interference from central parties.\n\nNear-Infinite Scalability\nTo be a viable option to boldly act as the foundation for the “internet of\ntomorrow”, SMSG 2.0 requires a linear model of scalability, essentially\nincreasing as more people (nodes) join the network (i.e., by using Particl\ndApps).\n\nThis feat is accomplished by radically changing how data travels between nodes.\nWhereas the current implementation of SMSG broadcasts all messages to all nodes\n— with only those with the proper private keys being able to decrypt the\nmessages’ content — SMSG 2.0 distributes that signal in a more structured\nfashion, with each node routing a (configurable) amount of traffic.\n\nThis effectively increases SMSG’s throughput as more nodes become available. And\nas more people use Particl dApps, more nodes become available, thus ensuring a\nsufficient count to provide the level of scalability any substantial increase in\nadoption requires.\n\n2. A New Modular Architecture\nThe second fold of Particl’s strategic plan is to give the ecosystem a new\nmodular dimension. Because to act as the pillar of the new internet requires a\nsignificant level of community involvement — notably in expanding the pool of\npioneers working on new, exciting decentralized applications and services —\nwe’ve got to ensure that the ecosystem is developer-friendly, coding efficient,\nand that its unique functionality can easily extend into the real world.\n\nParticl’s Current Infrastructure\nUnfortunately, that is not the case currently. Particl’s infrastructure is not\nas open as it could be, and the majority of its development hinges almost\nexclusively on the Particl team.\n\nEven in the event that an outside contributor would like to contribute work by\nbuilding a dApp or distributed service of their own, they require full\ncooperation with the Particl team to be added to Particl Desktop, the project’s\nmain access gateway, and adds up to the team’s responsibilities as it will need\nto keep the new dApp in line with any and all future desktop or core updates.\n\nIn reality, Particl’s current architecture is monolithic in nature, which isn’t\nas much of a problem if the project focuses solely on a single dApp — Particl\nMarketplace — but highly counterproductive and restrictive in the context of\nParticl as the foundation for a better internet protocol.\n\nCooperation Requirements for dApp Maintenance and Integration\nOne of Particl's current main issues is its architecture is very monolithic.\nEven though the Particl Marketplace may look like an application independent\nfrom Particl Desktop, it is not.\n\nIndeed, the code for Particl Marketplace is deeply intertwined with the Particl\nDesktop's codebase, essentially requiring the latter to access and use it. In\nthat sense, Particl Marketplace is more of a Particl Desktop feature rather than\na standalone dApp.\n\nParticl's new upcoming modular architecture remedies that by allowing for a much\ngreater level of independence between dApps (Particl Marketplace) and access\ngateways (Particl Desktop).\n\nEnabling the Ability to Re-Use Functionality Already Implemented on Other DApps\nNot only do outside contributors currently require the full cooperation of the\nParticl team to maintain and deploy their dApps, or even integrate Particl dApps\ninto their own products, but they also need to re-implement all key\nfunctionalities, even if already provided by other dApps, from scratch.\n\nLet’s take, for example, the hypothetical scenario where a community-funded\ndeveloper wishes to work on an end-to-end encrypted messenger dApp using the\nmessaging capabilities offered by the SMSG network. Naturally, one would\ninstantly take a look at Particl Marketplace and reuse its implementation of\nSMSG’s messaging functionality (as it is used to allow sellers and buyers to\ncommunicate with each other). However, that is not exactly possible.\n\nBecause even the most basic and key capabilities of the network must be\nhard-coded into Particl dApps, it is impossible to leverage implementations of\ndesired functionalities in other Dapps. Every single function instead requires\nto be re-implemented all over again.\n\nAgain, this is not a deal breaker for a project that focuses exclusively on one\ndApp. But for an ecosystem that aspires to become a foundation for a new,\nparallel internet, this must change to become more open and scalable.\n\nIntroducing Particl Modules and the Developer SDK\nTo remedy that situation, the Particl team will adopt a modular approach from\nnow on — isolating every core feature, functionality, and component of its\necosystem into a set of developer-friendly modules that can be added, removed,\nconfigured, and managed into a dApp (i.e., Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap DEX)\nor an access gateway (i.e., Particl Desktop, third-party wallet) independently.\n\nModules\nIn this context, a module refers to a readily-available packaged set of code,\nlibraries, and logic that provides a functionality, feature, or service to an\nexternal environment (i.e., a dApp). They grant dApps critical and/or common\nParticl features, allowing contributors to focus on what makes their own dApp\nunique rather than spending time reimplementing fundamental or complex\nfunctions.\n\nDeveloper SDK\nParticl’s upcoming SDK will empower developers to build various dApps using a \nstandardized set of development tools and documentation. Not only does the SDK\nimprove dApp security by ensuring their critical components are safely\nimplemented, but it also makes it easy and straightforward for developers to\nbuild privacy-first dApps. If the modules are the building blocks that\ndevelopers use to build dApps, the SDK is the glue that binds them together in a\nstructured and standardized way.\n\nAccess gateways\nThis term refers to any platform, app, or framework from which a dApp is\naccessed and used. This can be a desktop client like Particl Desktop, a web or\nSMSG page, a mobile application, or even a third-party integration.\n\nThe Mobile Apps vs Particl dApps Comparison\nA good analogy to better illustrate this new modular concept is by comparing\nParticl dApps to iOS or Android apps. Once installed on a phone, mobile\napplications, in a sense, take the form of independent “modules” that do not\nneed direct access to the underlying hardware features.\n\nInstead, should an app require access to the device’s camera, it requests\npermission to use the OS’s pre-packaged module that grants access rights to\nthird-party applications. This means the mobile team does not need to\nre-implement all the code and logic around using a device’s camera; it merely\nrequests this functionality from the OS.\nThis, in many ways, is the same way Particl modules function. Each of them\nprovides a functionality that dApp developers can simply query access to.\n\nNot only is this a critical step in making Particl more open to outside\ncontributors, but it’s also making the entire ecosystem much more resilient\nagainst outside interference by decentralizing and making more independent the\nway dApps are developed and maintained.\n\nDeploying Particl’s Key Modules\nAmong the wide variety of functionality and services that can be isolated into\nmodules, here are a few of which the team will initially focus on as we embark\non this new development phase.\n\n * Blockchain node modules (to integrate other cryptocurrencies)\n * Payment module (to provide payment solutions)\n * Market-related modules (to provide out-of-the-box eCommerce services)\n * Two-party escrow system (to provide trade assurance)\n * SMSG — End-to-end encrypted chat (for safe communications)\n * SMSG — Decentralized storage (to store data online)\n * SMSG — Decentralized hosting (to host web content and dApps)\n * SMSG — Controller module (to process, interpret, and interact with SMSG\n   messages (back-end services for developers))\n * Swap modules (including BasicSwap, to swap cryptocurrencies)\n * Staking module (to integrate PART staking capabilities)\n * Third-party integrations (to integrate extraneous protocols such as Tor, PGP,\n   i2p, IPFS, other mixnets, etc.)\n\nNote that other functionalities, features, or entire dApps can and will be\nisolated into modules as well. The above list merely showcases the most critical\nones but doesn’t go over all possibilities.\n\nHow Does This Benefit Particl?\nThe ecosystem's modular evolution introduces many benefits critical to the\nsuccess of Particl. Let's go over the main ones.\n\nMakes development easier and increases production pace\nWith a proper SDK toolkit at the disposal of developers, it becomes easier to\ndevelop an application when not having to deal with various setup and\nmaintenance burdens.\n\nCurrently, each new dApp added to Particl Desktop is built directly into the\nclient, meaning that each app needs to consider how the entire desktop client\nfits together, as well as how the current dApp impacts each of the other\nbuilt-in apps.\n\nFor example, the marketplace messaging system that is currently built into the\nmarketplace needs to be aware of how the whole dApp handles SMSG messages simply\nbecause it itself requires messaging capabilities. Therefore, any change to how\nParticl Marketplace handles messages requires changes to be made to the\nmessaging system implementation as well, essentially doubling the amount of work\nrequired and making any new feature or implementation a permanent development\nburden to maintain.\n\nThis type of situation can be avoided by isolating this messaging feature into\nan independent and standardized module, allowing dApp developers to simply\nrequest an out-of-the-box chat functionality from the appropriate module instead\nof creating it from scratch.\n\nThis will significantly speed up the development of dApps and facilitate\ncommunity contributions by making it easier, faster, and more straightforward to\nbuild dApps that ensure users’ rights are respected.\n\nMake dApp maintenance independent from the Particl team or platform they’re\nhosted on\nAdding to the benefit mentioned above, the introduction of modules makes dApps\nentirely independent from the Particl team and the access gateway they're made\navailable on.\n\nLet's use the popular Steam gaming platform as an example to better illustrate\nwhat this means.\n\nSteam was originally built to distribute Valve Software's games and updates to\nthose games, after which it grew to become a general gaming \"launcher\" platform.\nAs a result, it is today one of the most well-known means of obtaining games\nonline.\n\nWhen a game installed on Steam requires an update, it can be updated on its own,\nby the game development team, without requiring a Steam client-wide update. If\nthe Steam team needed to maintain, fix, and push updates for each game they host\non their ecosystem, it would quickly become an unscalable and highly impractical\nsituation.\n\nThat is, however, how the Particl ecosystem currently functions. Once a dApp or\nnew feature is settled on and integrated into the current Particl Desktop\nclient, the burden of maintenance falls on the Particl development team. In\naddition, the original author of a dApp or feature, which may or may not be a\nParticl team member, might no longer wish or be able to maintain the code, thus\ntransferring all these responsibilities to the Particl team for all future\nParticl Desktop releases.\n\nAnd then, even if the dApp author keeps on contributing, knowledge of all future\nplanned updates and changes to any portion of the Particl code is required by\nthe author as it may affect their own dApp and require adaptation coding work.\n\nUltimately, this causes Particl Desktop releases to become increasingly\ndependent on timely contributions from said authors, leading to delays and\ninefficiencies. In the context of a wide and open dApp ecosystem, it is an\nunmaintainable situation.\n\nThe new modular architecture eliminates these issues and enables independent\ndApp developers to develop and maintain their products separately from the\nParticl team or Particl Desktop releases schedules and according to their own\nterms.\n\nFaster rollout for updates, new features, and bug fixes\nRight now, a bug fix to a dApp such as Particl Marketplace requires an entire\nParticl Desktop client release. A bug fix under the new scenario can be rolled\nout as soon as the author feels it's ready, without needing to consider an\nentire client update or involve the Particl team.\n\nThat's because the bug fix, in that case, would be pushed not to the desktop\nclient itself but to the precise module affected by it, which then gets\nautomatically updated on all dApps that use that module.\n\nThis, again, takes the responsibility off of the Particl team and lets it focus\non the greater vision while contributors can promptly push their own fixes and\nmanage their apps without relying on the team's actions.\n\nFor example, if a dApp uses a Tor module to route traffic through Tor, it\nwouldn't need an ecosystem-wide update whenever Tor pushes an update to their\nnetwork. The update would instead be automatically applied to the module,\nensuring that all Particl dApps with Tor functionality are kept up-to-date with\nsecurity fixes.\n\nThis is a major stride towards better dApp security and more timely updates.\n\nIn Summary\nParticl's new modular architecture opens many doors, essentially transforming\nthe Particl ecosystem into a privacy-conscious and decentralized foundation for\nthe new internet.\n\nThis new approach can be broadly summarized in three key points:\n\n 1. The Particl ecosystem isn't any more a single big block of code; instead, it\n    is separated into independent modules, making it more open, accessible, and\n    developer-friendly than ever. It is also more resilient against central\n    points of failure.\n 2. Instead of requiring developers to re-implement all key functionalities,\n    dApps can simply request it to a particular module without building\n    everything or integrating everything from scratch, much like the example of\n    mobile OSes and mobile apps we've highlighted just above.\n 3. DApps become entirely independent from the Particl team, the wider Particl\n    ecosystem, and the access gateway on which they're made available.\n\n3. Access Gateways and dApp Accessibility\nOne of the most important goals of this new development cycle is to improve\naccessibility to Particl dApps so that they can be used by almost anyone,\nwithout complicated steps, and to stop relying exclusively on a single desktop\napplication for all purposes. This third fold of Particl's strategic plan is a\ncritical aspect in getting any sort of organic and sustained adoption.\n\nAs such, Particl's new modular approach makes it much easier to integrate\nmodules, or whole dApps, into different access gateways such as web or mobile\nframeworks or even into third-party applications.\n\nWeb Access\nHowever, as we’ve explored\n[https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/], hosting dApps on top\nof the current and centralized web environment, while highly convenient, carries\ncritical vulnerabilities and heavy downsides. With these challenges in mind, we\nplan on enabling alternative web hosting solutions, notably through SMSG 2.0’s\ncontent hosting capabilities.\n\nIndeed, as we’ve mentioned earlier, SMSG 2.0 is scheduled to evolve from a\ndistributed messaging protocol into a full-blown internet protocol more akin to\nsomething like Tor or i2p, eventually enabling dApps to be hosted on it and\naccessed from web browsers.\n\nOf course, with Particl becoming so flexible and open to community contributors,\nwe fully expect more traditional web and mobile versions of Particl dApps (i.e.,\nParticl Marketplace, BasicSwap DEX, two-party escrow system, end-to-end\nencrypted messenger) to be made available. The team also intends to deliver such\nsolutions to provide more options to the end-user.\n\nA New Modular Particl Desktop\nJust like the rest of the ecosystem, Particl Desktop will become a modular\nclient, enabling the end-user to add, remove, and configure dApps as they wish.\nThis promotes openness and choice and ensures that users do not need to install\nevery Particl dApp, some of which they may have no use for.\n\nFor example, one might not care about the Governance dApp, but the user is still\ncurrently forced to have it available because it is hard-coded into Particl\nDesktop. Alternatively, a user may not want to run the marketplace at all.\nStill, they are required to do so and, by the same process, spend computer\nresources decrypting all SMSG messages related to it (i.e., listings).\n\nWith a modular approach, the user could simply remove the marketplace dApp from\ntheir Particl Desktop application or simply never have to install it in the\nfirst place.\n\nDApp Store\nTo promote Particl’s vision, a “dApp store” may be made available, on which a\nlist of official or recommended dApps would be featured with the ability for\nindependent contributors to push their own dApps and modules to it.\n\nOf course, in the spirit of openness and decentralization, the dApp store will\nbe a convenient but optional platform for interacting with those dApps. As\nopen-source applications, it will be possible to download or install them via\nother ways as well.\n\n4. Currency and Protocol Agnosticism\nTo further promote openness and become an all-inclusive foundation for the\ninternet of tomorrow, Particl is fully embracing the concept of agnosticism by\nensuring its ecosystem can remain compatible with other cryptocurrencies and\nprotocols. This is the fourth fold of Particl's strategic plan.\n\nCurrency Agnosticism\nAs part of the range of modules available to developers will be\ncryptocurrency-specific modules that makes it possible for certain dApps to\nsupport other cryptocurrencies (i.e., Bitcoin).\n\nAlthough not all cryptocurrencies may be able to use all Particl features and\nservices (some of them requiring very specific functionality unique to the PART\nprivacy coin), this will extend the ecosystem's reach by welcoming other\ncryptocurrency communities and providing them with more utility for their coin.\n\nWhen a cryptocurrency cannot use a specific Particl functionality, a swap\nmodule, like BasicSwap DEX, for example, can be added to let the end-user swap\ntheir coins for PART or even have the dApp execute that action automatically as\na background process. This will allow holders of other cryptocurrencies to\nseamlessly benefit from Particl-specific features without negatively affecting\nthe user experience.\n\nIn the exact same way, a fiat gateway module, such as a service offering credit\ncard purchases of cryptocurrencies, can be added to the ecosystem and leveraged\nby dApp developers to provide added functionality to their products — further\nbridging the gap between the legacy payment industry and the world of\ncryptocurrencies.\n\nProtocol Agnosticism\nBecause dApps are developed using modules, it is possible to leverage protocols\nthat are not native to the Particl ecosystem to build some of their features.\n\nFor example, SMSG provides chat functionality to dApps through its messaging\nmodule. But a developer could decide to instead integrate a different messaging\nprotocol, like matrix [https://matrix.org/], which powers the Element Messenger\n[https://riot.im/app/#/room/#particl-project:matrix.org]. This would still grant\nthe dApp with messaging capabilities, but a different protocol would power it.\n\nThere are three main reasons behind this approach. For one, distinct protocols\nhave different pros and cons. Some use cases may get more out of a particular\nprotocol, while a different dApp may find it more efficient to use another. This\ngives more flexibility to developers and lets them work with what they think is\nin the best interest of their users.\n\nSecondly, it makes Particl dApps more resistant to the test of time. As\ntechnology evolves very rapidly, it is not rare to see major protocol\ninnovations appear. And because it's likely that, over time, better versions of\nprotocols used to build dApps become available, developers require the ability\nto seamlessly swap protocols to keep up with the evolutionary curve. In other\nwords, it makes it significantly easier to keep Particl dApps up-to-date with\nthe most recent progress in the space, ensuring the user gets the most of what\nis possible at the time that they use a dApp.\n\nFinally, it also makes dApps more secure and resilient against attacks. For\nexample, if a vulnerability is found in the protocol powering a certain dApp,\nits developer can simply swap the faulty module for an unaffected alternative.\nThis lets developers act quickly when there are security issues while preserving\nthe integrity of the other components of a dApp.\n\nNew Particl dApps are Coming Around\nParticl’s new modular approach opens up a ton of opportunities. Not only does it\nenable more efficient and secure dApps, but it also completely opens up its\ndevelopment process to the world.\n\nMoreover, with Particl’s CCS platform [https://ccs.particl.io], anyone can\npublish proposals seeking to fund the development of various dApps, creating a\nfully self-perpetuating economy and environment. And we know the Particl\ncommunity is not short of ideas! Indeed, once the modular architecture is\ndeployed, we fully expect to see a rapid increase in the number of community-led\ninitiatives.\n\nThat being said, the Particl team will, of course, be working on its own dApps\nnot only to showcase what is possible with the improved Particl infrastructure\nbut also to lead the way towards a better, fairer digital world for all.\n\nHere are dApps or services the Particl team will work on once different\ncomponents of the modular infrastructure go live.\n\nNew version of the marketplace This development cycle changes the back-end of\nthe ecosystem so much that a completely new version of the marketplace will need\nto be deployed. \n\nMore flexible, fast, and agnostic than the current version, it will offer the\nsame functionality but in a much more accessible way. In addition, the\nmarketplace will be designed so that its part, or its whole, can be integrated\ninto different access gateways like a website, mobile application, or\nthird-party integrations; all are cross-compatible. \n\nAlso, because of its cleaner, modular codebase, any future development, such as\nthe development of new features, will be dramatically sped up from the current\ntypical pace. \n\nin-progress waiting done Mobile version of the marketplace In just a few years,\nmobile devices are expected to be the preferential way people shop online. How\nmany times have any of us purchased goods on the internet using our phones?\nCountless times, we’re sure. \n\nThe reality, however, is different for sellers who, for the vast majority,\nmanage their business from desktop or laptop computers. \n\nThat is why one of Particl’s first dApps will be a buyer-focused mobile version\nof Particl Marketplace. This dApp will use the new modular approach of the\necosystem and showcase the use of a mobile access gateway into which Particl\ndApps will then be able to be integrated. \n\nin-progress waiting done Privacy-first messenger app Think Signal or Telegram,\nbut 100% decentralized and open-source. A privacy-first messenger application\ncould be deployed relatively easily on mobile and desktop environments.\nMoreover, because it only requires SMSG modules, such a dApp could likely become\navailable before even the release of the new version of the marketplace, as the\nlatter requires more modules to be put together in order to function and carries\na higher level of complexity. After all, because SMSG’s messaging capability is\nexpected to be used heavily in the future, it only makes sense to isolate it\ninto a proper standalone app or module early on. \n\nBesides, it will serve as an excellent showcase for the new SMSG 2.0 network and\nmobile access gateways. \n\nin-progress waiting done Standalone escrow app and integrations As a way to\ndemonstrate the integrability of modules, the Particl team may work on a\nshowcase in which a two-party escrow option becomes available on a new mobile\nwallet. \n\nAs we’ve discussed here\n[https://particl.news/an-overview-of-particls-two-party-escrow/], Particl’s\nnovel two-party escrow system has a wide range of use cases, all the way to\nin-person trade, and enabling this type of escrow outside of Particl Marketplace\nwill allow us to tap into and reach more of these possibilities. \n\nin-progress waiting done Third-party integrations The modular approach's\nintegration potential works in two ways: it, for one, allows Particl dApps to be\nintegrated into existing eCommerce platforms (i.e., a WooCommerce payment plugin\nwith two-party escrow contracts), but it also allows third-party services to be\nintegrated right into dApps as modules (i.e., a third-party inventory management\nsystem that a seller may be using on other platforms). \n\nAs such, you can expect, over time, a wide range of integrations to be made\navailable on the Particl dApp store or other popular platforms — in the form of\na WooCommerce plugin, for example. \n\nin-progress waiting done Timeline\nThis new major development cycle is expected to last from 12 to 18 months, with\nthe current team size, and start right after the release of Particl Desktop 3.3\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-3-what-to-expect/].\n\nHowever, the team has recently actively been looking for external funding and\npitching to various investors. Following a successful funding round, we fully\nintend on growing the development team (as well as other departments like\nmarketing and community too) to fill various key positions that will\nsignificantly speed up the process.\n\nPlease refer to the roadmap below for a general overview of the path forward. As\nalways, as we're dealing with moving targets and pioneering entirely new\ntechnology, the roadmap is likely to be updated and adjusted as we go.\n\n> Note: We will publish the pitch deck and Particl's new whitepaper, which we're\nboth using to pitch to investors, shortly into the future.\nFollow the Development Updates\nOnce this new major development cycle begins, right after the release of Particl\nDesktop 3.3, we will shift the focus from reporting development progress on\nParticl Desktop toward the greater Particl ecosystem. This will be reflected in\nthe way we report our weekly progress reports\n[https://particl.news/tag/progress/].\n\nFAQ\nWill Particl Desktop, Marketplace, and BasicSwap DEX continue to function during\nthis new development cycle? Yes. The new versions of these products will be\nbuilt in parallel to existing Particl dApps. Therefore, there will be no changes\nto the availability of current dApps while the improvements to the ecosystem are\nbeing made, and they will still be maintained as required. Only when new\nversions of these applications are launched will the legacy versions be\ndeprecated. \n\nin-progress waiting done Does adding the ability to use other coins within the\necosystem render PART useless? Absolutely not. PART is and will remain a\ncritical component of the Particl ecosystem. It is what powers its transactional\nprivacy and is a requirement for interacting with some of the more complex\nParticl smart contracts. Remember, what makes PART unique is that it possesses\nboth privacy and flexibility, a key aspect to many functions provided by Particl\ndApps that other cryptocurrencies cannot replicate. \n\nFor example, while an application built using Particl modules may allow for\nMonero payments, Monero still cannot be used with something like Particl’s\ntwo-party escrow system. In that case, the dApp’s developer may instead use a\npayment module, then a swap module to allow users to easily swap their Monero\nfor PART. This would let Monero users benefit from some of the more advanced\nmarketplace functions, such as its escrow capabilities, while still interacting\nwith it using Monero even if the payment ultimately settles in PART. \n\nOn the other hand, if a dApp requires simple payments to be made (for instance,\nsending Monero through messages sent via the upcoming messenger application),\nthen it may be possible to use Monero directly without having to route the\npayment through PART. \n\nWe aim to build an open and free ecosystem for all; forcing people to use a\nsingle cryptocurrency when they could be using others goes against that ethos.\nBy opening up the Particl ecosystem to the wider cryptocurrency community, we\nsignificantly increase the range of potential Particl dApps users and\nsuccessfully bring new levels of liberty and privacy to more people. After all,\nthis is Particl’s fundamental mission. \n\nin-progress waiting done Doesn’t this evolutionary process open up the door for\nmore centralization? Because Particl is about to become much more open-ended and\neasy to work with, businesses or independent developers may be interested in\ncoding dApps that are more centralized than, for example, the current version of\nParticl Marketplace (which makes no compromise whatsoever on that end). But at\nthe end of the day, it becomes up to the user to use that \"more centralized\"\nservice or a more open/decentralized/private service instead, basing their\ndecision on what's best for them. \n\nNonetheless, even when accounting for future, more centralized applications,\ntheir inclusion in the ecosystem brings considerable benefits at the level of\ndecentralization. \n\nFirst, it decentralizes the development process of the entire ecosystem by\ngiving easy-to-use tools for developers and business people all around the\nworld. No more will the platform's growth entirely depend on the core Particl\ndevelopment team — the new open and modular infrastructure will make it very\neasy for anyone to work on their own vision of Particl. This also radically\nimproves the resilience of the network as a whole. \n\nSecondly, combined with the CCS crowdfunding platform, this will positively\nimpact the amount and efficiency of contributions from the community as it will\nbe possible to self-fund great ideas using the treasury system, then realize\nthem using easy-to-use dev tools. Particl is blessed to have a strong community\nthat often comes up with great and revolutionary ideas, which we, the Particl\nteam, are excited about but unable to give the time they would require (because\nof the current maintenance requirements and our own roadmap). This new\nevolutionary leap forward fixes that obstacle. \n\nThe evolution of Particl's architecture to a modular one changes everything and\ngives all the power to users. Anyone with a great idea or who wishes to create a\ncertain dApp on Particl can easily submit a proposal, get it approved by the\ncommunity for funding, and either code it themselves or find a third-party\ndeveloper to do it. Using modules, bringing an idea to life will be possible for\nalmost any Web3 developer. \n\nin-progress waiting done Does Particl have the funds required to make all of\nthat happen? Although the current price of PART presents a challenge in terms of\ngrowth for the team, we’ve got enough funds to last for the duration of this\ndevelopment cycle at the current pace. \n\nHowever, we've recently been actively working on raising funds from external\ninvestors to complement the monthly claims from the network's treasury and\naccelerate our progress. Although we cannot reveal more information about it at\nthis time, we will publish our pitch deck and Particl's new whitepaper, which\nwe're both using to pitch, shortly into the future. \n\nin-progress waiting done How does the team expects to deliver on this with its\nsmall size? Any plans to grow the team? An aspect of this development cycle's\nstrategy is to grow the development team to help on the various components and\ndApp projects. But, of course, this is highly contingent on the amount of\nfunding at our disposal, whether through better PART prices or external funding.\nThis is why we've recently made raising funds one of our top priorities. \n\nBesides, one of the critical goal of this cycle is to further decentralize the\ndevelopment process to allow more independent developers to contribute to the\necosystem on their own. This will reduce the burden on the Particl team and\nallow for more people to help the network grow. \n\nin-progress waiting done What about marketing in all of this? Again, the scale\nand timing of marketing efforts is equally contingent on the amount of funding\nat the team's disposal. And although this evolutionary leap forward is mostly\ndevelopment-focused — as it deals with foundational work — we still have\ndifferent marketing and communications initiatives ready to deploy as soon as\nfinancial capabilities permit. \n\nBut, at its core, this \"foundational phase\" is a necessary step that will result\nin much more accessible, user-friendly, and convenient dApps — a critical factor\nthat affects both user acquisition and retention, and also leads to better\nmarketing ROI. For this reason, it is, in many ways, a long-term play towards\nfuture marketing and outreach efforts, ensuring Particl dApps live up to the\nhype of the marketing efforts that will promote them. \n\nIn addition, this entire phase expands on the ecosystem’s use cases and target\naudiences — essentially vastly increasing our pool of potential users. The team\nfully expects to capitalize on this opportunity by carefully and gradually\nincreasing marketing and outreach efforts as we progress through this cycle’s\ncritical milestones, notably as we incrementally release new products and major\nupdates. \n\nin-progress waiting done Does that mean that dApps like Particl Marketplace\ncould be integrated into other cryptocurrency wallets? Yes. Even further, it\nmeans that any Particl dApp can be ‘white labeled’ or re-interpreted by anyone.\nA cryptocurrency project could, for example, integrate Particl Marketplace into\nits own coin wallet, take out the escrow, and force payments to be made\nexclusively using their cryptocurrency. Then, to pay for the SMSG anti-spam fee,\nthey could simply build a system around a swap module like BasicSwap to\nautomatically and seamlessly exchange their native coin to PART to pay for\nlisting fees. \n\nIn fact, there is great potential for these sorts of projects. Third-party\nintegrations and white-labeled solutions can help more communities thrive by\nreaping the network's liberty and privacy benefits. It can also generate revenue\nfor the project in a way that's mutually beneficial for all parties involved.\nThis will be an important aspect of Particl's adoption and go-to-market strategy\nas we incrementally release new products. \n\nin-progress waiting done Will the current version of SMSG be deprecated? No,\nSMSG 1.0 is not planned to be deprecated for the moment, even when SMSG 2.0\ncomes out. Instead, they will run parallel to each other as their differences\nmake up for varying pros and cons, which may be better suited for different\nuse-cases. \n\nin-progress waiting done How long is this development cycle expected to last? \nDelivering the envisioned future of Particl in full is no small task and is\nexpected to last 12 to 18 months, assuming no additional (external) source of\nfunding for the team. However, this time estimate will likely improve as we\ngradually grow the team and fill various key positions following a successful\nfunding round. However, it's important to note that these months spent working\nthrough this development phase will be far from uneventful as we have planned\nseveral incremental releases. Therefore, 12 to 18 months is the estimate for the\nentire process to be over, but in the meantime, you can expect different\nexciting releases to keep things very interesting. \n\nFor example, while it may take longer to release the new version of Particl\nMarketplace, largely due to its complexity and the sheer number of modules it\nuses, SMSG 2.0 or the privacy-first messenger app might launch before that time.\nThat’s because the new version of Particl Marketplace uses many different\nmodules which, individually, will be ready at different points in time. \n\nIn the case of the privacy-first messenger app, it is, at its core, a much\nsimpler dApp. Because it uses fewer modules than Particl Marketplace, it would\nbe much easier and quicker to deploy. And since the messaging function of SMSG\nis expected to be leveraged by many future dApp, it only makes sense to deploy\nit early on into the process. \n\nin-progress waiting done","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"></figure><p>If you’ve been following Particl closely, then you may have heard whispers that the Particl team is gearing up to undertake a new major development cycle.

With the web now having such a prevalent place in our society, this crisis ends up bleeding into every single aspect of our lives — it affects not only our finances but also our private communications, our personal and professional lives, and our ability to do almost anything online.</p><p>Gone are the days of what once was a free and open web. Instead, as we’ve recently explored in various <a href=\"https://particl.news/tag/stories/\">Particl Stories</a>, there is a worryingly increasing trend in the rate of censorship, <a href=\"https://particl.news/unhosted-wallets-and-the-fight-against-out-of-touch-policies/\">geo-political meddling</a>, <a href=\"https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/\">big tech abuses</a>, <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-need-for-an-open-source-revolution/\">reckless data mining</a>, and various agenda-driven actions by the Internet’s largest platform operators.</p><p>Undoubtedly, we, as individuals, need to stand up to this takeover and take back control of our web. We need to reassert and safeguard our rights to an open, free, and private web environment, as it was originally intended to be, and be the change we want to see in this world!</p><p>Whereas certain governments, corporations, or other types of organizations continue to elevate their level of control and power using the current web infrastructure, there is a growing need to stop fighting on their own turf and, instead, pioneer the digital world of tomorrow in which the rights and freedoms of each individual are guaranteed.</p><p>When accessible and easy to use, disruptive technology — as is the case with Particl’s privacy-first dApps — becomes both a shield and a weapon, protecting us from digital abuse but also striking back by allowing people to thrive without interference from the current centralized web infrastructure.</p><h3 id=\"the-shortcomings-of-web3\">The Shortcomings of Web3</h3><p>That is, in essence, what Web3 promised to accomplish: a more open, independent, and free internet for all. Unfortunately, <a href=\"https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/\">as we’ve come to discover</a>, what Web3 promises and what it currently delivers diverges on many fronts. If you dive into its present state, you can see that it’s much more centralized than it first appears — relying, in major parts, on traditional “big tech” infrastructure — and that it turns out to be a near disaster in terms of privacy and decentralization.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Web3 Exposed!

On the latter, only a few parties can access your financial information. That would typically be your bank or the payment processor you’re using, government organizations, and their partners. With Web3 services, your financial data, while pseudonymous, is permanently and publicly stored for the whole world to see. Anyone curious enough can simply look for the entirety of your information in public records.</p><p>Case in point, here are <a href=\"https://debank.com/profile/0xb432863b3857f1cd9d78f5856a8d20693a8bc1a0?chain=eth\">the financial assets of a random public Ethereum user</a>, <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xb432863b3857f1cd9d78f5856a8d20693a8bc1a0\">their detailed financial history</a>, <a href=\"https://debank.com/profile/0xb432863b3857f1cd9d78f5856a8d20693a8bc1a0/nft?chain=eth\">as well as all the NFTs they own</a>. And while we’ve simply picked a random user that had just traded on Uniswap at the time of this writing, the totality of their financial information is permanently out in the open. Anyone that then sends payments to that address is able to track, down to the cent, the totality of its owner’s past, present, and future financial activities; a terrible foundation from which to build the “economy or internet of tomorrow”.</p><p>What’s more, not all Web3 apps are as decentralized and open as they claim, such as we’ve seen with <a href=\"https://medium.com/coinmonks/as-metamask-and-opensea-abide-by-us-sanctions-the-russian-ban-is-in-the-spotlight-67611df121f8\">Infura, MetaMask</a>, and various other dApps that use their services like the not-so-decentralized <a href=\"https://cryptobriefing.com/metamask-opensea-blocks-expose-centralization-in-web3/\">NFT marketplace OpenSea</a>.</p><p>With so many similar examples recently in mind, It’s difficult to see Web3 succeed on its stated mission when its biggest and most popular apps end up not living up to their promises at best and, at worst, significantly eroding online privacy and security compared to even Web2.</p><p>In reality, the main problem doesn’t stem from Web3 as a basic concept but rather from its poor implementation of the principles required to fulfill its mission; a lack of vision from some of Web3’s leaders, or in other cases, the sheer pursuit of fast profit, leads to cutting corners and sacrificing the most critical foundations of Web3.</p><p>Indeed, it is deluded to think fighting the centralization of powers on the web can be done by building apps and services with less privacy than on traditional web infrastructure or hosting them on said outdated infrastructure. Yet, it unfortunately appears to be the direction that Web3 is headed towards.</p><p><strong><em>Particl’s next development cycle is all about steering this ship in the right direction.</em></strong></p><h3 id=\"building-the-right-foundation\">Building the Right Foundation</h3><p>Particl’s new development cycle is about steering Web3 in the right direction by granting it <strong>a truly independent and resilient foundation on which privacy-first decentralized applications can be deployed</strong>.</p><p>By leveraging the firepower of an <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/electric-capital/developer-reports/master/dev_report_2021_updated_012622.pdf\">ever-growing community of Web3 pioneers</a> and giving them tools that follow a privacy-first approach, a decentralized and open-source alternative to the traditional web infrastructure can be built to fight back against the centralization of powers. It is up to all of us to create a parallel and independent environment that puts individuals at the center — simultaneously armed and shielded with privacy-first dApps — and liberates them from the ever-tightening noose that is the centralization of powers online and all the consequences it brings forth.</p><h2 id=\"announcing-particl-s-new-major-development-cycle\">Announcing Particl’s New Major Development Cycle</h2><p>In a nutshell, Particl’s new development cycle focuses on expanding the ecosystem’s strengths and endowing it with a new, modular infrastructure, ultimately building a solid foundation on which to easily build and use privacy-first dApps.</p><p>Before we go into further details on this new development cycle, it’s important to understand the reasoning behind the journey ahead by first being aware of Particl’s strengths and what makes it unique.</p><h3 id=\"what-makes-particl-unique\">What Makes Particl Unique?</h3><p>Particl is a revolutionary and powerful ecosystem like none other thanks to a unique combination of two core components: Particl Blockchain and the SecureMessaging network (SMSG).</p><h4 id=\"particl-blockchain\">Particl Blockchain </h4><p>The Particl Blockchain is a unique and powerful blockchain that contains both various privacy-preserving features (CT, RingCT, stealth addresses, Taproot, etc) as well as a high level of flexibility.</p><p>While its native cryptocurrency, PART, <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd/\">allows for untraceable payments to be made (privacy coin)</a>, the blockchain infrastructure allows for the creation of complex, decentralized, and privacy-first applications through the use of smart contracts and scriptless scripts (off-chain, private, and scalable smart contracts). This unique convergence of privacy capabilities and application flexibility allows for the Particl Blockchain to carve a niche of its own within the blockchain industry with an uncompromising focus on “privacy-first dApps”, such as Particl <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Marketplace</a> or <a href=\"https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/\">BasicSwap DEX</a>.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> Although the concept of smart contracts is well known to most people within the cryptocurrency community, scriptless scripts, on the other hand, tend to be less widely known. You can learn more about them </em><a href=\"https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex#scriptless-scripts\"><em>here</em></a><em> or by reading this </em><a href=\"https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/introduction-to-scriptless-scripts\"><em>in-depth guide</em></a><em>.</em></blockquote><h4 id=\"securemessaging-network-smsg-\">SecureMessaging Network (SMSG)</h4><p>SecureMessaging (SMSG) is a P2P mixnet that allows peers to communicate encrypted data with other peers or applications without the need for third parties or middlemen. Inspired by the<a href=\"https://www.whonix.org/wiki/BitMessage\"> BitMessage protocol</a>, it stores and transfers data across nodes in a privacy-preserving manner, encrypted from end to end (E2EE).</p><p>In other words, SMSG is a decentralized messaging layer that both dApps and users themselves can use. Its usage enables the creation and deployment of much more complex decentralized applications than what can be done using smart contracts exclusively. You can read more on the SMSG network <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\">here</a>.</p><h2 id=\"particl-s-four-pillars-for-the-new-digital-world\">Particl's Four Pillars for the New Digital World</h2><p>Particl's unique combination of a private and flexible blockchain with a decentralized mixnet makes possible the creation of advanced privacy-first dApps that protect the rights and liberties of its users.</p><p>Compared to the majority of Web3, Particl dApps are a major improvement in terms of the values they are committed to. We must capitalize on that potential for the good of not only the project but also the well-being of the internet and society as a whole.</p><p>The strategic plan to make all of this happen is fourfold:</p><ol><li><a href=\"#1-smsg-2-0-a-decentralized-and-private-internet-protocol\">Deploy a new, more powerful mixnet to expand on the network's capabilities (already well in its conceptualization phase, tentatively named \"SMSG 2.0\")</a></li><li><a href=\"#2-giving-particl-a-modular-dimension\">Transform Particl into a modular and development-friendly infrastructure</a></li><li><a href=\"#3-a-greater-focus-on-access-gateways-and-dapp-accessibility\">Deploy new \"access gateways\" (i.e., web, mobile, and SMSG frameworks) to host decentralized applications and interact with them</a></li><li><a href=\"#4-a-commitment-to-agnosticism\">Commit as much as possible to an agnostic philosophy</a></li></ol><p>Let's explore these four central aspects of Particl's new strategic plan in more detail.</p><h2 id=\"1-smsg-2-0-a-decentralized-and-private-internet-protocol\">1. SMSG 2.0 — A Decentralized and Private Internet Protocol</h2><p>A big reason why Particl dApps are so unique is due to them leveraging the <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\">data transmission and storage capabilities of the SMSG network</a>, which runs in parallel but independently to Particl Blockchain nodes. This makes possible more advanced features and functionality than traditional smart-contract dApps, as is the case with both the Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap DEX dApps.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">The SMSG Network — Enabling Dapps With True Privacy</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Learn more about what makes Particl decentralized applications truly special and private!</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://particl.news/icons/icon-512x512.png\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Particl News</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">cryptoguard</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://particl.news/static/6b2dad3b47be647f145e4bbace6c1950/smsg_network-medium-2.jpg\"></div></a></figure><p>But while the SMSG network offers pristine privacy and a very secure, trustless way to communicate data between peers, it is not scalable enough to support massive levels of simultaneous usage.</p><p>Additionally, it only allows for data transmission and temporary storage, making it more akin to a messaging protocol rather than a fully-fledged internet infrastructure.</p><p>And so, the <strong>first fold of Particl’s new strategic plan is to re-imagine SMSG to make it more scalable and allow for even more advanced functionality</strong> — essentially doubling down on its strengths and expanding on its use-cases.</p><h3 id=\"an-open-and-decentralized-web-architecture\">An Open and Decentralized Web Architecture</h3><p>To get groundbreaking results, you sometimes need to think outside the box. It is true that the current version of SMSG provides the privacy and capabilities we need to build privacy-first dApps — however, it is limited in terms of how much usage the network can sustain. Furthermore, updating its current code implementation would only result in marginal scalability improvements due to the way it is built.</p><p>That’s why a completely new version of SMSG, built from scratch and with the mission of serving as the foundation for the new internet, is required.</p><h4 id=\"distributed-web-content-and-dapp-hosting\">Distributed Web Content and dApp Hosting</h4><p>A critical new functionality SMSG requires is the ability to not only store data but also <strong>host and allow for direct interaction with web content and dApps</strong> — entirely independently from any traditional web infrastructure (the “world wide web”).</p><p>To put it another way, this major functionality update amounts to transforming SMSG from a messaging network into a fully decentralized, independent, free, and privacy-first internet protocol that’s open to all, without restrictions.</p><p>With dApps and web content hosted on — and accessible from — this distributed network, it provides a viable alternative for people to opt out completely of our current internet infrastructure, which has grown corrupted and toxic over the past few decades. Plus, content and dApps hosted on it become entirely censorship-proof as the decentralized nature of this network shields them from any interference from central parties.</p><h4 id=\"near-infinite-scalability\">Near-Infinite Scalability</h4><p>To be a viable option to boldly act as the foundation for the “internet of tomorrow”, SMSG 2.0 requires a linear model of scalability, essentially increasing as more people (nodes) join the network (i.e., by using Particl dApps).</p><p>This feat is accomplished by radically changing how data travels between nodes. Whereas the current implementation of SMSG broadcasts all messages to all nodes — with only those with the proper private keys being able to decrypt the messages’ content — <strong>SMSG 2.0 distributes that signal in a more structured fashion, with each node routing a (configurable) amount of traffic</strong>.</p><p>This effectively increases SMSG’s throughput as more nodes become available. And as more people use Particl dApps, more nodes become available, thus ensuring a sufficient count to provide the level of scalability any substantial increase in adoption requires.</p><h2 id=\"2-a-new-modular-architecture\">2. A New Modular Architecture</h2><p><strong>The second fold of Particl’s strategic plan is to give the ecosystem a new modular dimension.</strong> Because to act as the pillar of the new internet requires a significant level of community involvement — notably in expanding the pool of pioneers working on new, exciting decentralized applications and services — we’ve got to ensure that the ecosystem is developer-friendly, coding efficient, and that its unique functionality can easily extend into the real world.</p><h3 id=\"particl-s-current-infrastructure\">Particl’s Current Infrastructure</h3><p>Unfortunately, that is not the case currently. Particl’s infrastructure is not as open as it could be, and the majority of its development hinges almost exclusively on the Particl team.</p><p>Even in the event that an outside contributor would like to contribute work by building a dApp or distributed service of their own, they require full cooperation with the Particl team to be added to Particl Desktop, the project’s main access gateway, and adds up to the team’s responsibilities as it will need to keep the new dApp in line with any and all future desktop or core updates.</p><p>In reality, Particl’s current architecture is monolithic in nature, which isn’t as much of a problem if the project focuses solely on a single dApp — Particl Marketplace — but highly counterproductive and restrictive in the context of Particl as the foundation for a better internet protocol.</p><h4 id=\"cooperation-requirements-for-dapp-maintenance-and-integration\">Cooperation Requirements for dApp Maintenance and Integration</h4><p>One of Particl's current main issues is its architecture is very monolithic. Even though the Particl Marketplace may look like an application independent from Particl Desktop, it is not.</p><p>Indeed, the code for Particl Marketplace is deeply intertwined with the Particl Desktop's codebase, essentially requiring the latter to access and use it. In that sense, Particl Marketplace is more of a Particl Desktop feature rather than a standalone dApp.</p><p>Particl's new upcoming modular architecture remedies that by allowing for a much greater level of independence between dApps (Particl Marketplace) and access gateways (Particl Desktop).</p><h4 id=\"enabling-the-ability-to-re-use-functionality-already-implemented-on-other-dapps\">Enabling the Ability to Re-Use Functionality Already Implemented on Other DApps</h4><p>Not only do outside contributors currently require the full cooperation of the Particl team to maintain and deploy their dApps, or even integrate Particl dApps into their own products, but they also need to re-implement all key functionalities, even if already provided by other dApps, from scratch.</p><p>Let’s take, for example, the hypothetical scenario where a community-funded developer wishes to work on an end-to-end encrypted messenger dApp using the messaging capabilities offered by the SMSG network. Naturally, one would instantly take a look at Particl Marketplace and reuse its implementation of SMSG’s messaging functionality (as it is used to allow sellers and buyers to communicate with each other). However, that is not exactly possible.</p><p>Because even the most basic and key capabilities of the network must be hard-coded into Particl dApps, it is impossible to leverage implementations of desired functionalities in other Dapps. Every single function instead requires to be re-implemented all over again.</p><p>Again, this is not a deal breaker for a project that focuses exclusively on one dApp. But for an ecosystem that aspires to become a foundation for a new, parallel internet, this must change to become more open and scalable.</p><h3 id=\"introducing-particl-modules-and-the-developer-sdk\">Introducing Particl Modules and the Developer SDK</h3><p>To remedy that situation, the Particl team will adopt a modular approach from now on — isolating every core feature, functionality, and component of its ecosystem into a set of developer-friendly <strong>modules</strong> that can be added, removed, configured, and managed into a dApp (i.e., Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap DEX) or an access gateway (i.e., Particl Desktop, third-party wallet) independently.</p><h4 id=\"modules\">Modules</h4><p>In this context, a<strong> module </strong>refers to a<strong> readily-available packaged set of code, libraries, and logic that provides a functionality, feature, or service to an external environment (i.e., a dApp)</strong>. They grant dApps critical and/or common Particl features, allowing contributors to focus on what makes their own dApp unique rather than spending time reimplementing fundamental or complex functions.</p><h4 id=\"developer-sdk\">Developer SDK</h4><p>Particl’s upcoming SDK will empower developers to build various dApps using a <strong>standardized set of development tools and documentation</strong>. Not only does the SDK improve dApp security by ensuring their critical components are safely implemented, but it also makes it easy and straightforward for developers to build privacy-first dApps. If the modules are the building blocks that developers use to build dApps, the SDK is the glue that binds them together in a structured and standardized way.</p><h4 id=\"access-gateways\">Access gateways</h4><p>This term refers to any platform, app, or framework from which a dApp is accessed and used. This can be a desktop client like Particl Desktop, a web or SMSG page, a mobile application, or even a third-party integration.</p><h3 id=\"the-mobile-apps-vs-particl-dapps-comparison\">The Mobile Apps vs Particl dApps Comparison</h3><p>A good analogy to better illustrate this new modular concept is by comparing Particl dApps to iOS or Android apps. Once installed on a phone, mobile applications, in a sense, take the form of independent “modules” that do not need direct access to the underlying hardware features.</p><p>Instead, should an app require access to the device’s camera, it requests permission to use the OS’s pre-packaged module that grants access rights to third-party applications. This means the mobile team does not need to re-implement all the code and logic around using a device’s camera; it merely requests this functionality from the OS.<br>This, in many ways, is the same way Particl modules function. Each of them provides a functionality that dApp developers can simply query access to.</p><p>Not only is this a critical step in making Particl more open to outside contributors, but it’s also making the entire ecosystem much more resilient against outside interference by decentralizing and making more independent the way dApps are developed and maintained.</p><h3 id=\"deploying-particl-s-key-modules\">Deploying Particl’s Key Modules</h3><p>Among the wide variety of functionality and services that can be isolated into modules, here are a few of which the team will initially focus on as we embark on this new development phase.</p><ul><li><strong>Blockchain node modules</strong> (to integrate other cryptocurrencies)</li><li><strong>Payment module</strong> (to provide payment solutions)</li><li><strong>Market-related modules</strong> (to provide out-of-the-box eCommerce services)</li><li><strong>Two-party escrow system</strong> (to provide trade assurance)</li><li><strong>SMSG — End-to-end encrypted chat</strong> (for safe communications)</li><li><strong>SMSG — Decentralized storage</strong> (to store data online)</li><li><strong>SMSG — Decentralized hosting</strong> (to host web content and dApps)</li><li><strong>SMSG — Controller module</strong> (to process, interpret, and interact with SMSG messages (back-end services for developers))</li><li><strong>Swap modules</strong> (including BasicSwap, to swap cryptocurrencies)</li><li><strong>Staking module</strong> (to integrate PART staking capabilities)</li><li><strong>Third-party integrations</strong> (to integrate extraneous protocols such as Tor, PGP, i2p, IPFS, other mixnets, etc.)</li></ul><p>Note that other functionalities, features, or entire dApps can and will be isolated into modules as well. The above list merely showcases the most critical ones but doesn’t go over all possibilities.</p><h3 id=\"how-does-this-benefit-particl\">How Does This Benefit Particl?</h3><p>The ecosystem's modular evolution introduces many benefits critical to the success of Particl. Let's go over the main ones.</p><h4 id=\"makes-development-easier-and-increases-production-pace\">Makes development easier and increases production pace</h4><p>With a proper SDK toolkit at the disposal of developers, it becomes easier to develop an application when not having to deal with various setup and maintenance burdens.</p><p>Currently, each new dApp added to Particl Desktop is built directly into the client, meaning that each app needs to consider how the entire desktop client fits together, as well as how the current dApp impacts each of the other built-in apps.</p><p>For example, the marketplace messaging system that is currently built into the marketplace needs to be aware of how the whole dApp handles SMSG messages simply because it itself requires messaging capabilities. Therefore, any change to how Particl Marketplace handles messages requires changes to be made to the messaging system implementation as well, essentially doubling the amount of work required and making any new feature or implementation a permanent development burden to maintain.</p><p>This type of situation can be avoided by isolating this messaging feature into an independent and standardized module, allowing dApp developers to simply request an out-of-the-box chat functionality from the appropriate module instead of creating it from scratch.</p><p>This will significantly speed up the development of dApps and facilitate community contributions by making it easier, faster, and more straightforward to build dApps that ensure users’ rights are respected.</p><h4 id=\"make-dapp-maintenance-independent-from-the-particl-team-or-platform-they-re-hosted-on\">Make dApp maintenance independent from the Particl team or platform they’re hosted on</h4><p>Adding to the benefit mentioned above, the introduction of modules makes dApps entirely independent from the Particl team and the access gateway they're made available on.</p><p>Let's use the popular Steam gaming platform as an example to better illustrate what this means.</p><p>Steam was originally built to distribute Valve Software's games and updates to those games, after which it grew to become a general gaming \"launcher\" platform. As a result, it is today one of the most well-known means of obtaining games online.</p><p>When a game installed on Steam requires an update, it can be updated on its own, by the game development team, without requiring a Steam client-wide update. If the Steam team needed to maintain, fix, and push updates for each game they host on their ecosystem, it would quickly become an unscalable and highly impractical situation.</p><p>That is, however, how the Particl ecosystem currently functions. Once a dApp or new feature is settled on and integrated into the current Particl Desktop client, the burden of maintenance falls on the Particl development team. In addition, the original author of a dApp or feature, which may or may not be a Particl team member, might no longer wish or be able to maintain the code, thus transferring all these responsibilities to the Particl team for all future Particl Desktop releases.</p><p>And then, even if the dApp author keeps on contributing, knowledge of all future planned updates and changes to any portion of the Particl code is required by the author as it may affect their own dApp and require adaptation coding work.</p><p>Ultimately, this causes Particl Desktop releases to become increasingly dependent on timely contributions from said authors, leading to delays and inefficiencies. In the context of a wide and open dApp ecosystem, it is an unmaintainable situation.</p><p>The new modular architecture eliminates these issues and enables independent dApp developers to develop and maintain their products separately from the Particl team or Particl Desktop releases schedules and according to their own terms.</p><h4 id=\"faster-rollout-for-updates-new-features-and-bug-fixes\">Faster rollout for updates, new features, and bug fixes</h4><p>Right now, a bug fix to a dApp such as Particl Marketplace requires an entire Particl Desktop client release. A bug fix under the new scenario can be rolled out as soon as the author feels it's ready, without needing to consider an entire client update or involve the Particl team.</p><p>That's because the bug fix, in that case, would be pushed not to the desktop client itself but to the precise module affected by it, which then gets automatically updated on all dApps that use that module.</p><p>This, again, takes the responsibility off of the Particl team and lets it focus on the greater vision while contributors can promptly push their own fixes and manage their apps without relying on the team's actions.</p><p>For example, if a dApp uses a Tor module to route traffic through Tor, it wouldn't need an ecosystem-wide update whenever Tor pushes an update to their network. The update would instead be automatically applied to the module, ensuring that all Particl dApps with Tor functionality are kept up-to-date with security fixes.</p><p>This is a major stride towards better dApp security and more timely updates.</p><h3 id=\"in-summary\">In Summary</h3><p>Particl's new modular architecture opens many doors, essentially transforming the Particl ecosystem into a privacy-conscious and decentralized foundation for the new internet.</p><p>This new approach can be broadly summarized in three key points:</p><ol><li>The Particl ecosystem isn't any more a single big block of code; instead, it is separated into independent modules, making it more open, accessible, and developer-friendly than ever. It is also more resilient against central points of failure.</li><li>Instead of requiring developers to re-implement all key functionalities, dApps can simply request it to a particular module without building everything or integrating everything from scratch, much like the example of mobile OSes and mobile apps we've highlighted just above.</li><li>DApps become entirely independent from the Particl team, the wider Particl ecosystem, and the access gateway on which they're made available.</li></ol><h2 id=\"3-access-gateways-and-dapp-accessibility\">3. Access Gateways and dApp Accessibility</h2><p>One of the most important goals of this new development cycle is to improve accessibility to Particl dApps so that they can be used by almost anyone, without complicated steps, and to stop relying exclusively on a single desktop application for all purposes. <strong>This third fold of Particl's strategic plan is a critical aspect in getting any sort of organic and sustained adoption.</strong></p><p>As such, Particl's new modular approach makes it much easier to integrate modules, or whole dApps, into different access gateways such as web or mobile frameworks or even into third-party applications.</p><h3 id=\"web-access\">Web Access</h3><p>However, <a href=\"https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/\">as we’ve explored</a>, hosting dApps on top of the current and centralized web environment, while highly convenient, carries critical vulnerabilities and heavy downsides. With these challenges in mind, we plan on enabling alternative web hosting solutions, notably through SMSG 2.0’s content hosting capabilities.</p><p>Indeed, as we’ve mentioned earlier, SMSG 2.0 is scheduled to evolve from a distributed messaging protocol into a full-blown internet protocol more akin to something like Tor or i2p, eventually enabling dApps to be hosted on it and accessed from web browsers.</p><p>Of course, with Particl becoming so flexible and open to community contributors, we fully expect more traditional web and mobile versions of Particl dApps (i.e., Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap DEX, two-party escrow system, end-to-end encrypted messenger) to be made available. The team also intends to deliver such solutions to provide more options to the end-user.</p><h3 id=\"a-new-modular-particl-desktop\">A New Modular Particl Desktop</h3><p>Just like the rest of the ecosystem, Particl Desktop will become a modular client, enabling the end-user to add, remove, and configure dApps as they wish. This promotes openness and choice and ensures that users do not need to install every Particl dApp, some of which they may have no use for.</p><p>For example, one might not care about the Governance dApp, but the user is still currently forced to have it available because it is hard-coded into Particl Desktop. Alternatively, a user may not want to run the marketplace at all. Still, they are required to do so and, by the same process, spend computer resources decrypting all SMSG messages related to it (i.e., listings).</p><p>With a modular approach, the user could simply remove the marketplace dApp from their Particl Desktop application or simply never have to install it in the first place.</p><h4 id=\"dapp-store\">DApp Store</h4><p>To promote Particl’s vision, a “dApp store” may be made available, on which a list of official or recommended dApps would be featured with the ability for independent contributors to push their own dApps and modules to it.</p><p>Of course, in the spirit of openness and decentralization, the dApp store will be a convenient but optional platform for interacting with those dApps. As open-source applications, it will be possible to download or install them via other ways as well.</p><h2 id=\"4-currency-and-protocol-agnosticism\">4. Currency and Protocol Agnosticism</h2><p>To further promote openness and become an all-inclusive foundation for the internet of tomorrow, Particl is fully embracing the concept of agnosticism by ensuring its ecosystem can remain compatible with other cryptocurrencies and protocols. <strong>This is the fourth fold of Particl's strategic plan</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"currency-agnosticism\">Currency Agnosticism</h3><p>As part of the range of modules available to developers will be cryptocurrency-specific modules that makes it possible for certain dApps to support other cryptocurrencies (i.e., Bitcoin).</p><p>Although not all cryptocurrencies may be able to use all Particl features and services (some of them requiring very specific functionality unique to the PART privacy coin), this will extend the ecosystem's reach by welcoming other cryptocurrency communities and providing them with more utility for their coin.</p><p>When a cryptocurrency cannot use a specific Particl functionality, a swap module, like BasicSwap DEX, for example, can be added to let the end-user swap their coins for PART or even have the dApp execute that action automatically as a background process. This will allow holders of other cryptocurrencies to seamlessly benefit from Particl-specific features without negatively affecting the user experience.</p><p>In the exact same way, a fiat gateway module, such as a service offering credit card purchases of cryptocurrencies, can be added to the ecosystem and leveraged by dApp developers to provide added functionality to their products — further bridging the gap between the legacy payment industry and the world of cryptocurrencies.</p><h3 id=\"protocol-agnosticism\">Protocol Agnosticism</h3><p>Because dApps are developed using modules, it is possible to leverage protocols that are not native to the Particl ecosystem to build some of their features.</p><p>For example, SMSG provides chat functionality to dApps through its messaging module. But a developer could decide to instead integrate a different messaging protocol, like <a href=\"https://matrix.org/\">matrix</a>, which powers the <a href=\"https://riot.im/app/#/room/#particl-project:matrix.org\">Element Messenger</a>. This would still grant the dApp with messaging capabilities, but a different protocol would power it.</p><p>There are three main reasons behind this approach. For one, distinct protocols have different pros and cons. Some use cases may get more out of a particular protocol, while a different dApp may find it more efficient to use another. This gives more flexibility to developers and lets them work with what they think is in the best interest of their users.</p><p>Secondly, it makes Particl dApps more resistant to the test of time. As technology evolves very rapidly, it is not rare to see major protocol innovations appear. And because it's likely that, over time, better versions of protocols used to build dApps become available, developers require the ability to seamlessly swap protocols to keep up with the evolutionary curve. In other words, it makes it significantly easier to keep Particl dApps up-to-date with the most recent progress in the space, ensuring the user gets the most of what is possible at the time that they use a dApp.</p><p>Finally, it also makes dApps more secure and resilient against attacks. For example, if a vulnerability is found in the protocol powering a certain dApp, its developer can simply swap the faulty module for an unaffected alternative. This lets developers act quickly when there are security issues while preserving the integrity of the other components of a dApp.</p><h2 id=\"new-particl-dapps-are-coming-around\">New Particl dApps are Coming Around</h2><p>Particl’s new modular approach opens up a ton of opportunities. Not only does it enable more efficient and secure dApps, but it also completely opens up its development process to the world.</p><p>Moreover, with <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io\">Particl’s CCS platform</a>, anyone can publish proposals seeking to fund the development of various dApps, creating a fully self-perpetuating economy and environment. And we know the Particl community is not short of ideas! Indeed, once the modular architecture is deployed, we fully expect to see a rapid increase in the number of community-led initiatives.</p><p>That being said, the Particl team will, of course, be working on its own dApps not only to showcase what is possible with the improved Particl infrastructure but also to lead the way towards a better, fairer digital world for all.</p><p>Here are dApps or services the Particl team will work on once different components of the modular infrastructure go live.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center full light-one\" id=\"btn-add_01\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"col\">\n    <div class=\"tabs\">\n      <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">New version of the marketplace</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            This development cycle changes the back-end of the ecosystem so much that a completely new version of the marketplace will need to be deployed.\n            <br><br>\n            More flexible, fast, and agnostic than the current version, it will offer the same functionality but in a much more accessible way. In addition, the marketplace will be designed so that its part, or its whole, can be integrated into different access gateways like a website, mobile application, or third-party integrations; all are cross-compatible.\n            <br><br>\n            Also, because of its cleaner, modular codebase, any future development, such as the development of new features, will be dramatically sped up from the current typical pace.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n        \n      <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck3\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck3\">Mobile version of the marketplace</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            In just a few years, mobile devices are expected to be the preferential way people shop online.

Countless times, we’re sure.\n            <br><br>\n            The reality, however, is different for sellers who, for the vast majority, manage their business from desktop or laptop computers.\n            <br><br>\n            That is why one of Particl’s first dApps will be a buyer-focused mobile version of Particl Marketplace. This dApp will use the new modular approach of the ecosystem and showcase the use of a mobile access gateway into which Particl dApps will then be able to be integrated.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck4\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck4\">Privacy-first messenger app</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Think Signal or Telegram, but 100% decentralized and open-source. A privacy-first messenger application could be deployed relatively easily on mobile and desktop environments. Moreover, because it only requires SMSG modules, such a dApp could likely become available before even the release of the new version of the marketplace, as the latter requires more modules to be put together in order to function and carries a higher level of complexity. After all, because SMSG’s messaging capability is expected to be used heavily in the future, it only makes sense to isolate it into a proper standalone app or module early on.\n            <br><br>\n            Besides, it will serve as an excellent showcase for the new SMSG 2.0 network and mobile access gateways.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck5\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck5\">Standalone escrow app and integrations</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            As a way to demonstrate the integrability of modules, the Particl team may work on a showcase in which a two-party escrow option becomes available on a new mobile wallet.\n            <br><br>\n            As we’ve discussed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://particl.news/an-overview-of-particls-two-party-escrow/\">here</a>, Particl’s novel two-party escrow system has a wide range of use cases, all the way to in-person trade, and enabling this type of escrow outside of Particl Marketplace will allow us to tap into and reach more of these possibilities.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck6\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck6\">Third-party integrations</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            The modular approach's integration potential works in two ways: it, for one, allows Particl dApps to be integrated into existing eCommerce platforms (i.e., a WooCommerce payment plugin with two-party escrow contracts), but it also allows third-party services to be integrated right into dApps as modules (i.e., a third-party inventory management system that a seller may be using on other platforms).\n            <br><br>\n            As such, you can expect, over time, a wide range of integrations to be made available on the Particl dApp store or other popular platforms — in the form of a WooCommerce plugin, for example.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n    </div><!-- tabs close-->\n  </div><!-- col close-->\n</div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h1 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h1><p>This new major development cycle is expected to last from 12 to 18 months, with the current team size, and start right after the release of <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-3-what-to-expect/\">Particl Desktop 3.3</a>.</p><p>However, the team has recently actively been looking for external funding and pitching to various investors.

The new versions of these products will be built in parallel to existing Particl dApps. Therefore, there will be no changes to the availability of current dApps while the improvements to the ecosystem are being made, and they will still be maintained as required. Only when new versions of these applications are launched will the legacy versions be deprecated.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n        \n      <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck3\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck3\">Does adding the ability to use other coins within the ecosystem render PART useless?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Absolutely not. PART is and will remain a critical component of the Particl ecosystem. It is what powers its transactional privacy and is a requirement for interacting with some of the more complex Particl smart contracts. Remember, what makes PART unique is that it possesses both privacy and flexibility, a key aspect to many functions provided by Particl dApps that other cryptocurrencies cannot replicate.\n            <br><br>\n            For example, while an application built using Particl modules may allow for Monero payments, Monero still cannot be used with something like Particl’s two-party escrow system. In that case, the dApp’s developer may instead use a payment module, then a swap module to allow users to easily swap their Monero for PART. This would let Monero users benefit from some of the more advanced marketplace functions, such as its escrow capabilities, while still interacting with it using Monero even if the payment ultimately settles in PART.\n            <br><br>\n            On the other hand, if a dApp requires simple payments to be made (for instance, sending Monero through messages sent via the upcoming messenger application), then it may be possible to use Monero directly without having to route the payment through PART.\n            <br><br>\n            We aim to build an open and free ecosystem for all; forcing people to use a single cryptocurrency when they could be using others goes against that ethos. By opening up the Particl ecosystem to the wider cryptocurrency community, we significantly increase the range of potential Particl dApps users and successfully bring new levels of liberty and privacy to more people. After all, this is Particl’s fundamental mission. \n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck4\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck4\">Doesn’t this evolutionary process open up the door for more centralization?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Because Particl is about to become much more open-ended and easy to work with, businesses or independent developers may be interested in coding dApps that are more centralized than, for example, the current version of Particl Marketplace (which makes no compromise whatsoever on that end). But at the end of the day, it becomes up to the user to use that \"more centralized\" service or a more open/decentralized/private service instead, basing their decision on what's best for them.\n            <br><br>\n            Nonetheless, even when accounting for future, more centralized applications, their inclusion in the ecosystem brings considerable benefits at the level of decentralization.\n            <br><br>\n            First, it decentralizes the development process of the entire ecosystem by giving easy-to-use tools for developers and business people all around the world. No more will the platform's growth entirely depend on the core Particl development team — the new open and modular infrastructure will make it very easy for anyone to work on their own vision of Particl. This also radically improves the resilience of the network as a whole.\n            <br><br>\n            Secondly, combined with the CCS crowdfunding platform, this will positively impact the amount and efficiency of contributions from the community as it will be possible to self-fund great ideas using the treasury system, then realize them using easy-to-use dev tools. Particl is blessed to have a strong community that often comes up with great and revolutionary ideas, which we, the Particl team, are excited about but unable to give the time they would require (because of the current maintenance requirements and our own roadmap). This new evolutionary leap forward fixes that obstacle.\n            <br><br>\n            The evolution of Particl's architecture to a modular one changes everything and gives all the power to users. Anyone with a great idea or who wishes to create a certain dApp on Particl can easily submit a proposal, get it approved by the community for funding, and either code it themselves or find a third-party developer to do it. Using modules, bringing an idea to life will be possible for almost any Web3 developer.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck6\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck6\">Does Particl have the funds required to make all of that happen?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Although the current price of PART presents a challenge in terms of growth for the team, we’ve got enough funds to last for the duration of this development cycle at the current pace.\n            <br><br>\n            However, we've recently been actively working on raising funds from external investors to complement the monthly claims from the network's treasury and accelerate our progress. Although we cannot reveal more information about it at this time, we will publish our pitch deck and Particl's new whitepaper, which we're both using to pitch, shortly into the future.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck7\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck7\">How does the team expects to deliver on this with its small size?

But, of course, this is highly contingent on the amount of funding at our disposal, whether through better PART prices or external funding. This is why we've recently made raising funds one of our top priorities.\n            <br><br>\n            Besides, one of the critical goal of this cycle is to further decentralize the development process to allow more independent developers to contribute to the ecosystem on their own. This will reduce the burden on the Particl team and allow for more people to help the network grow. \n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck8\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck8\">What about marketing in all of this?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Again, the scale and timing of marketing efforts is equally contingent on the amount of funding at the team's disposal.

For this reason, it is, in many ways, a long-term play towards future marketing and outreach efforts, ensuring Particl dApps live up to the hype of the marketing efforts that will promote them.\n            <br><br>\n            In addition, this entire phase expands on the ecosystem’s use cases and target audiences — essentially vastly increasing our pool of potential users. The team fully expects to capitalize on this opportunity by carefully and gradually increasing marketing and outreach efforts as we progress through this cycle’s critical milestones, notably as we incrementally release new products and major updates.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck9\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck9\">Does that mean that dApps like Particl Marketplace could be integrated into other cryptocurrency wallets?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Yes. Even further, it means that any Particl dApp can be ‘white labeled’ or re-interpreted by anyone. A cryptocurrency project could, for example, integrate Particl Marketplace into its own coin wallet, take out the escrow, and force payments to be made exclusively using their cryptocurrency. Then, to pay for the SMSG anti-spam fee, they could simply build a system around a swap module like BasicSwap to automatically and seamlessly exchange their native coin to PART to pay for listing fees. \n            <br><br>\n            In fact, there is great potential for these sorts of projects. Third-party integrations and white-labeled solutions can help more communities thrive by reaping the network's liberty and privacy benefits. It can also generate revenue for the project in a way that's mutually beneficial for all parties involved. This will be an important aspect of Particl's adoption and go-to-market strategy as we incrementally release new products.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck10\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck10\">Will the current version of SMSG be deprecated?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            No, SMSG 1.0 is not planned to be deprecated for the moment, even when SMSG 2.0 comes out.

However, this time estimate will likely improve as we gradually grow the team and fill various key positions following a successful funding round. However, it's important to note that these months spent working through this development phase will be far from uneventful as we have planned several incremental releases. Therefore, 12 to 18 months is the estimate for the entire process to be over, but in the meantime, you can expect different exciting releases to keep things very interesting.\n            <br><br>\n            For example, while it may take longer to release the new version of Particl Marketplace, largely due to its complexity and the sheer number of modules it uses, SMSG 2.0 or the privacy-first messenger app might launch before that time. That’s because the new version of Particl Marketplace uses many different modules which, individually, will be ready at different points in time. \n            <br><br>\n            In the case of the privacy-first messenger app, it is, at its core, a much simpler dApp. Because it uses fewer modules than Particl Marketplace, it would be much easier and quicker to deploy. And since the messaging function of SMSG is expected to be leveraged by many future dApp, it only makes sense to deploy it early on into the process.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n    </div><!-- tabs close-->\n  </div><!-- col close-->\n</div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html-->","url":"http://localhost:2368/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"d25c43aa-687c-423a-8918-0d276a3c8800","codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"62e1e75c910c1554f0dd5b4e","reading_time":30,"send_email_when_published":false,"email_subject":null,"childHtmlRehype":{"html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"/glink/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 1000w, /glink/size/w1600/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 1600w, /glink/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"></figure><p>If you’ve been following Particl closely, then you may have heard whispers that the Particl team is gearing up to undertake a new major development cycle.

With the web now having such a prevalent place in our society, this crisis ends up bleeding into every single aspect of our lives — it affects not only our finances but also our private communications, our personal and professional lives, and our ability to do almost anything online.</p><p>Gone are the days of what once was a free and open web. Instead, as we’ve recently explored in various <a href=\"https://particl.news/tag/stories/\">Particl Stories</a>, there is a worryingly increasing trend in the rate of censorship, <a href=\"https://particl.news/unhosted-wallets-and-the-fight-against-out-of-touch-policies/\">geo-political meddling</a>, <a href=\"https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/\">big tech abuses</a>, <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-need-for-an-open-source-revolution/\">reckless data mining</a>, and various agenda-driven actions by the Internet’s largest platform operators.</p><p>Undoubtedly, we, as individuals, need to stand up to this takeover and take back control of our web. We need to reassert and safeguard our rights to an open, free, and private web environment, as it was originally intended to be, and be the change we want to see in this world!</p><p>Whereas certain governments, corporations, or other types of organizations continue to elevate their level of control and power using the current web infrastructure, there is a growing need to stop fighting on their own turf and, instead, pioneer the digital world of tomorrow in which the rights and freedoms of each individual are guaranteed.</p><p>When accessible and easy to use, disruptive technology — as is the case with Particl’s privacy-first dApps — becomes both a shield and a weapon, protecting us from digital abuse but also striking back by allowing people to thrive without interference from the current centralized web infrastructure.</p><h3 id=\"the-shortcomings-of-web3\">The Shortcomings of Web3</h3><p>That is, in essence, what Web3 promised to accomplish: a more open, independent, and free internet for all. Unfortunately, <a href=\"https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/\">as we’ve come to discover</a>, what Web3 promises and what it currently delivers diverges on many fronts. If you dive into its present state, you can see that it’s much more centralized than it first appears — relying, in major parts, on traditional “big tech” infrastructure — and that it turns out to be a near disaster in terms of privacy and decentralization.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Web3 Exposed!

On the latter, only a few parties can access your financial information. That would typically be your bank or the payment processor you’re using, government organizations, and their partners. With Web3 services, your financial data, while pseudonymous, is permanently and publicly stored for the whole world to see. Anyone curious enough can simply look for the entirety of your information in public records.</p><p>Case in point, here are <a href=\"https://debank.com/profile/0xb432863b3857f1cd9d78f5856a8d20693a8bc1a0?chain=eth\">the financial assets of a random public Ethereum user</a>, <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xb432863b3857f1cd9d78f5856a8d20693a8bc1a0\">their detailed financial history</a>, <a href=\"https://debank.com/profile/0xb432863b3857f1cd9d78f5856a8d20693a8bc1a0/nft?chain=eth\">as well as all the NFTs they own</a>. And while we’ve simply picked a random user that had just traded on Uniswap at the time of this writing, the totality of their financial information is permanently out in the open. Anyone that then sends payments to that address is able to track, down to the cent, the totality of its owner’s past, present, and future financial activities; a terrible foundation from which to build the “economy or internet of tomorrow”.</p><p>What’s more, not all Web3 apps are as decentralized and open as they claim, such as we’ve seen with <a href=\"https://medium.com/coinmonks/as-metamask-and-opensea-abide-by-us-sanctions-the-russian-ban-is-in-the-spotlight-67611df121f8\">Infura, MetaMask</a>, and various other dApps that use their services like the not-so-decentralized <a href=\"https://cryptobriefing.com/metamask-opensea-blocks-expose-centralization-in-web3/\">NFT marketplace OpenSea</a>.</p><p>With so many similar examples recently in mind, It’s difficult to see Web3 succeed on its stated mission when its biggest and most popular apps end up not living up to their promises at best and, at worst, significantly eroding online privacy and security compared to even Web2.</p><p>In reality, the main problem doesn’t stem from Web3 as a basic concept but rather from its poor implementation of the principles required to fulfill its mission; a lack of vision from some of Web3’s leaders, or in other cases, the sheer pursuit of fast profit, leads to cutting corners and sacrificing the most critical foundations of Web3.</p><p>Indeed, it is deluded to think fighting the centralization of powers on the web can be done by building apps and services with less privacy than on traditional web infrastructure or hosting them on said outdated infrastructure. Yet, it unfortunately appears to be the direction that Web3 is headed towards.</p><p><strong><em>Particl’s next development cycle is all about steering this ship in the right direction.</em></strong></p><h3 id=\"building-the-right-foundation\">Building the Right Foundation</h3><p>Particl’s new development cycle is about steering Web3 in the right direction by granting it <strong>a truly independent and resilient foundation on which privacy-first decentralized applications can be deployed</strong>.</p><p>By leveraging the firepower of an <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/electric-capital/developer-reports/master/dev_report_2021_updated_012622.pdf\">ever-growing community of Web3 pioneers</a> and giving them tools that follow a privacy-first approach, a decentralized and open-source alternative to the traditional web infrastructure can be built to fight back against the centralization of powers. It is up to all of us to create a parallel and independent environment that puts individuals at the center — simultaneously armed and shielded with privacy-first dApps — and liberates them from the ever-tightening noose that is the centralization of powers online and all the consequences it brings forth.</p><h2 id=\"announcing-particl-s-new-major-development-cycle\">Announcing Particl’s New Major Development Cycle</h2><p>In a nutshell, Particl’s new development cycle focuses on expanding the ecosystem’s strengths and endowing it with a new, modular infrastructure, ultimately building a solid foundation on which to easily build and use privacy-first dApps.</p><p>Before we go into further details on this new development cycle, it’s important to understand the reasoning behind the journey ahead by first being aware of Particl’s strengths and what makes it unique.</p><h3 id=\"what-makes-particl-unique\">What Makes Particl Unique?</h3><p>Particl is a revolutionary and powerful ecosystem like none other thanks to a unique combination of two core components: Particl Blockchain and the SecureMessaging network (SMSG).</p><h4 id=\"particl-blockchain\">Particl Blockchain </h4><p>The Particl Blockchain is a unique and powerful blockchain that contains both various privacy-preserving features (CT, RingCT, stealth addresses, Taproot, etc) as well as a high level of flexibility.</p><p>While its native cryptocurrency, PART, <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd/\">allows for untraceable payments to be made (privacy coin)</a>, the blockchain infrastructure allows for the creation of complex, decentralized, and privacy-first applications through the use of smart contracts and scriptless scripts (off-chain, private, and scalable smart contracts). This unique convergence of privacy capabilities and application flexibility allows for the Particl Blockchain to carve a niche of its own within the blockchain industry with an uncompromising focus on “privacy-first dApps”, such as Particl <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Marketplace</a> or <a href=\"https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/\">BasicSwap DEX</a>.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> Although the concept of smart contracts is well known to most people within the cryptocurrency community, scriptless scripts, on the other hand, tend to be less widely known. You can learn more about them </em><a href=\"https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex#scriptless-scripts\"><em>here</em></a><em> or by reading this </em><a href=\"https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/introduction-to-scriptless-scripts\"><em>in-depth guide</em></a><em>.</em></blockquote><h4 id=\"securemessaging-network-smsg-\">SecureMessaging Network (SMSG)</h4><p>SecureMessaging (SMSG) is a P2P mixnet that allows peers to communicate encrypted data with other peers or applications without the need for third parties or middlemen. Inspired by the<a href=\"https://www.whonix.org/wiki/BitMessage\"> BitMessage protocol</a>, it stores and transfers data across nodes in a privacy-preserving manner, encrypted from end to end (E2EE).</p><p>In other words, SMSG is a decentralized messaging layer that both dApps and users themselves can use. Its usage enables the creation and deployment of much more complex decentralized applications than what can be done using smart contracts exclusively. You can read more on the SMSG network <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\">here</a>.</p><h2 id=\"particl-s-four-pillars-for-the-new-digital-world\">Particl's Four Pillars for the New Digital World</h2><p>Particl's unique combination of a private and flexible blockchain with a decentralized mixnet makes possible the creation of advanced privacy-first dApps that protect the rights and liberties of its users.</p><p>Compared to the majority of Web3, Particl dApps are a major improvement in terms of the values they are committed to. We must capitalize on that potential for the good of not only the project but also the well-being of the internet and society as a whole.</p><p>The strategic plan to make all of this happen is fourfold:</p><ol><li><a href=\"#1-smsg-2-0-a-decentralized-and-private-internet-protocol\">Deploy a new, more powerful mixnet to expand on the network's capabilities (already well in its conceptualization phase, tentatively named \"SMSG 2.0\")</a></li><li><a href=\"#2-giving-particl-a-modular-dimension\">Transform Particl into a modular and development-friendly infrastructure</a></li><li><a href=\"#3-a-greater-focus-on-access-gateways-and-dapp-accessibility\">Deploy new \"access gateways\" (i.e., web, mobile, and SMSG frameworks) to host decentralized applications and interact with them</a></li><li><a href=\"#4-a-commitment-to-agnosticism\">Commit as much as possible to an agnostic philosophy</a></li></ol><p>Let's explore these four central aspects of Particl's new strategic plan in more detail.</p><h2 id=\"1-smsg-2-0-a-decentralized-and-private-internet-protocol\">1. SMSG 2.0 — A Decentralized and Private Internet Protocol</h2><p>A big reason why Particl dApps are so unique is due to them leveraging the <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\">data transmission and storage capabilities of the SMSG network</a>, which runs in parallel but independently to Particl Blockchain nodes. This makes possible more advanced features and functionality than traditional smart-contract dApps, as is the case with both the Particl Marketplace and BasicSwap DEX dApps.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">The SMSG Network — Enabling Dapps With True Privacy</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Learn more about what makes Particl decentralized applications truly special and private!</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://particl.news/icons/icon-512x512.png\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Particl News</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">cryptoguard</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://particl.news/static/6b2dad3b47be647f145e4bbace6c1950/smsg_network-medium-2.jpg\"></div></a></figure><p>But while the SMSG network offers pristine privacy and a very secure, trustless way to communicate data between peers, it is not scalable enough to support massive levels of simultaneous usage.</p><p>Additionally, it only allows for data transmission and temporary storage, making it more akin to a messaging protocol rather than a fully-fledged internet infrastructure.</p><p>And so, the <strong>first fold of Particl’s new strategic plan is to re-imagine SMSG to make it more scalable and allow for even more advanced functionality</strong> — essentially doubling down on its strengths and expanding on its use-cases.</p><h3 id=\"an-open-and-decentralized-web-architecture\">An Open and Decentralized Web Architecture</h3><p>To get groundbreaking results, you sometimes need to think outside the box. It is true that the current version of SMSG provides the privacy and capabilities we need to build privacy-first dApps — however, it is limited in terms of how much usage the network can sustain. Furthermore, updating its current code implementation would only result in marginal scalability improvements due to the way it is built.</p><p>That’s why a completely new version of SMSG, built from scratch and with the mission of serving as the foundation for the new internet, is required.</p><h4 id=\"distributed-web-content-and-dapp-hosting\">Distributed Web Content and dApp Hosting</h4><p>A critical new functionality SMSG requires is the ability to not only store data but also <strong>host and allow for direct interaction with web content and dApps</strong> — entirely independently from any traditional web infrastructure (the “world wide web”).</p><p>To put it another way, this major functionality update amounts to transforming SMSG from a messaging network into a fully decentralized, independent, free, and privacy-first internet protocol that’s open to all, without restrictions.</p><p>With dApps and web content hosted on — and accessible from — this distributed network, it provides a viable alternative for people to opt out completely of our current internet infrastructure, which has grown corrupted and toxic over the past few decades. Plus, content and dApps hosted on it become entirely censorship-proof as the decentralized nature of this network shields them from any interference from central parties.</p><h4 id=\"near-infinite-scalability\">Near-Infinite Scalability</h4><p>To be a viable option to boldly act as the foundation for the “internet of tomorrow”, SMSG 2.0 requires a linear model of scalability, essentially increasing as more people (nodes) join the network (i.e., by using Particl dApps).</p><p>This feat is accomplished by radically changing how data travels between nodes. Whereas the current implementation of SMSG broadcasts all messages to all nodes — with only those with the proper private keys being able to decrypt the messages’ content — <strong>SMSG 2.0 distributes that signal in a more structured fashion, with each node routing a (configurable) amount of traffic</strong>.</p><p>This effectively increases SMSG’s throughput as more nodes become available. And as more people use Particl dApps, more nodes become available, thus ensuring a sufficient count to provide the level of scalability any substantial increase in adoption requires.</p><h2 id=\"2-a-new-modular-architecture\">2. A New Modular Architecture</h2><p><strong>The second fold of Particl’s strategic plan is to give the ecosystem a new modular dimension.</strong> Because to act as the pillar of the new internet requires a significant level of community involvement — notably in expanding the pool of pioneers working on new, exciting decentralized applications and services — we’ve got to ensure that the ecosystem is developer-friendly, coding efficient, and that its unique functionality can easily extend into the real world.</p><h3 id=\"particl-s-current-infrastructure\">Particl’s Current Infrastructure</h3><p>Unfortunately, that is not the case currently. Particl’s infrastructure is not as open as it could be, and the majority of its development hinges almost exclusively on the Particl team.</p><p>Even in the event that an outside contributor would like to contribute work by building a dApp or distributed service of their own, they require full cooperation with the Particl team to be added to Particl Desktop, the project’s main access gateway, and adds up to the team’s responsibilities as it will need to keep the new dApp in line with any and all future desktop or core updates.</p><p>In reality, Particl’s current architecture is monolithic in nature, which isn’t as much of a problem if the project focuses solely on a single dApp — Particl Marketplace — but highly counterproductive and restrictive in the context of Particl as the foundation for a better internet protocol.</p><h4 id=\"cooperation-requirements-for-dapp-maintenance-and-integration\">Cooperation Requirements for dApp Maintenance and Integration</h4><p>One of Particl's current main issues is its architecture is very monolithic. Even though the Particl Marketplace may look like an application independent from Particl Desktop, it is not.</p><p>Indeed, the code for Particl Marketplace is deeply intertwined with the Particl Desktop's codebase, essentially requiring the latter to access and use it. In that sense, Particl Marketplace is more of a Particl Desktop feature rather than a standalone dApp.</p><p>Particl's new upcoming modular architecture remedies that by allowing for a much greater level of independence between dApps (Particl Marketplace) and access gateways (Particl Desktop).</p><h4 id=\"enabling-the-ability-to-re-use-functionality-already-implemented-on-other-dapps\">Enabling the Ability to Re-Use Functionality Already Implemented on Other DApps</h4><p>Not only do outside contributors currently require the full cooperation of the Particl team to maintain and deploy their dApps, or even integrate Particl dApps into their own products, but they also need to re-implement all key functionalities, even if already provided by other dApps, from scratch.</p><p>Let’s take, for example, the hypothetical scenario where a community-funded developer wishes to work on an end-to-end encrypted messenger dApp using the messaging capabilities offered by the SMSG network. Naturally, one would instantly take a look at Particl Marketplace and reuse its implementation of SMSG’s messaging functionality (as it is used to allow sellers and buyers to communicate with each other). However, that is not exactly possible.</p><p>Because even the most basic and key capabilities of the network must be hard-coded into Particl dApps, it is impossible to leverage implementations of desired functionalities in other Dapps. Every single function instead requires to be re-implemented all over again.</p><p>Again, this is not a deal breaker for a project that focuses exclusively on one dApp. But for an ecosystem that aspires to become a foundation for a new, parallel internet, this must change to become more open and scalable.</p><h3 id=\"introducing-particl-modules-and-the-developer-sdk\">Introducing Particl Modules and the Developer SDK</h3><p>To remedy that situation, the Particl team will adopt a modular approach from now on — isolating every core feature, functionality, and component of its ecosystem into a set of developer-friendly <strong>modules</strong> that can be added, removed, configured, and managed into a dApp (i.e., Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap DEX) or an access gateway (i.e., Particl Desktop, third-party wallet) independently.</p><h4 id=\"modules\">Modules</h4><p>In this context, a<strong> module </strong>refers to a<strong> readily-available packaged set of code, libraries, and logic that provides a functionality, feature, or service to an external environment (i.e., a dApp)</strong>. They grant dApps critical and/or common Particl features, allowing contributors to focus on what makes their own dApp unique rather than spending time reimplementing fundamental or complex functions.</p><h4 id=\"developer-sdk\">Developer SDK</h4><p>Particl’s upcoming SDK will empower developers to build various dApps using a <strong>standardized set of development tools and documentation</strong>. Not only does the SDK improve dApp security by ensuring their critical components are safely implemented, but it also makes it easy and straightforward for developers to build privacy-first dApps. If the modules are the building blocks that developers use to build dApps, the SDK is the glue that binds them together in a structured and standardized way.</p><h4 id=\"access-gateways\">Access gateways</h4><p>This term refers to any platform, app, or framework from which a dApp is accessed and used. This can be a desktop client like Particl Desktop, a web or SMSG page, a mobile application, or even a third-party integration.</p><h3 id=\"the-mobile-apps-vs-particl-dapps-comparison\">The Mobile Apps vs Particl dApps Comparison</h3><p>A good analogy to better illustrate this new modular concept is by comparing Particl dApps to iOS or Android apps. Once installed on a phone, mobile applications, in a sense, take the form of independent “modules” that do not need direct access to the underlying hardware features.</p><p>Instead, should an app require access to the device’s camera, it requests permission to use the OS’s pre-packaged module that grants access rights to third-party applications. This means the mobile team does not need to re-implement all the code and logic around using a device’s camera; it merely requests this functionality from the OS.<br>This, in many ways, is the same way Particl modules function. Each of them provides a functionality that dApp developers can simply query access to.</p><p>Not only is this a critical step in making Particl more open to outside contributors, but it’s also making the entire ecosystem much more resilient against outside interference by decentralizing and making more independent the way dApps are developed and maintained.</p><h3 id=\"deploying-particl-s-key-modules\">Deploying Particl’s Key Modules</h3><p>Among the wide variety of functionality and services that can be isolated into modules, here are a few of which the team will initially focus on as we embark on this new development phase.</p><ul><li><strong>Blockchain node modules</strong> (to integrate other cryptocurrencies)</li><li><strong>Payment module</strong> (to provide payment solutions)</li><li><strong>Market-related modules</strong> (to provide out-of-the-box eCommerce services)</li><li><strong>Two-party escrow system</strong> (to provide trade assurance)</li><li><strong>SMSG — End-to-end encrypted chat</strong> (for safe communications)</li><li><strong>SMSG — Decentralized storage</strong> (to store data online)</li><li><strong>SMSG — Decentralized hosting</strong> (to host web content and dApps)</li><li><strong>SMSG — Controller module</strong> (to process, interpret, and interact with SMSG messages (back-end services for developers))</li><li><strong>Swap modules</strong> (including BasicSwap, to swap cryptocurrencies)</li><li><strong>Staking module</strong> (to integrate PART staking capabilities)</li><li><strong>Third-party integrations</strong> (to integrate extraneous protocols such as Tor, PGP, i2p, IPFS, other mixnets, etc.)</li></ul><p>Note that other functionalities, features, or entire dApps can and will be isolated into modules as well. The above list merely showcases the most critical ones but doesn’t go over all possibilities.</p><h3 id=\"how-does-this-benefit-particl\">How Does This Benefit Particl?</h3><p>The ecosystem's modular evolution introduces many benefits critical to the success of Particl. Let's go over the main ones.</p><h4 id=\"makes-development-easier-and-increases-production-pace\">Makes development easier and increases production pace</h4><p>With a proper SDK toolkit at the disposal of developers, it becomes easier to develop an application when not having to deal with various setup and maintenance burdens.</p><p>Currently, each new dApp added to Particl Desktop is built directly into the client, meaning that each app needs to consider how the entire desktop client fits together, as well as how the current dApp impacts each of the other built-in apps.</p><p>For example, the marketplace messaging system that is currently built into the marketplace needs to be aware of how the whole dApp handles SMSG messages simply because it itself requires messaging capabilities. Therefore, any change to how Particl Marketplace handles messages requires changes to be made to the messaging system implementation as well, essentially doubling the amount of work required and making any new feature or implementation a permanent development burden to maintain.</p><p>This type of situation can be avoided by isolating this messaging feature into an independent and standardized module, allowing dApp developers to simply request an out-of-the-box chat functionality from the appropriate module instead of creating it from scratch.</p><p>This will significantly speed up the development of dApps and facilitate community contributions by making it easier, faster, and more straightforward to build dApps that ensure users’ rights are respected.</p><h4 id=\"make-dapp-maintenance-independent-from-the-particl-team-or-platform-they-re-hosted-on\">Make dApp maintenance independent from the Particl team or platform they’re hosted on</h4><p>Adding to the benefit mentioned above, the introduction of modules makes dApps entirely independent from the Particl team and the access gateway they're made available on.</p><p>Let's use the popular Steam gaming platform as an example to better illustrate what this means.</p><p>Steam was originally built to distribute Valve Software's games and updates to those games, after which it grew to become a general gaming \"launcher\" platform. As a result, it is today one of the most well-known means of obtaining games online.</p><p>When a game installed on Steam requires an update, it can be updated on its own, by the game development team, without requiring a Steam client-wide update. If the Steam team needed to maintain, fix, and push updates for each game they host on their ecosystem, it would quickly become an unscalable and highly impractical situation.</p><p>That is, however, how the Particl ecosystem currently functions. Once a dApp or new feature is settled on and integrated into the current Particl Desktop client, the burden of maintenance falls on the Particl development team. In addition, the original author of a dApp or feature, which may or may not be a Particl team member, might no longer wish or be able to maintain the code, thus transferring all these responsibilities to the Particl team for all future Particl Desktop releases.</p><p>And then, even if the dApp author keeps on contributing, knowledge of all future planned updates and changes to any portion of the Particl code is required by the author as it may affect their own dApp and require adaptation coding work.</p><p>Ultimately, this causes Particl Desktop releases to become increasingly dependent on timely contributions from said authors, leading to delays and inefficiencies. In the context of a wide and open dApp ecosystem, it is an unmaintainable situation.</p><p>The new modular architecture eliminates these issues and enables independent dApp developers to develop and maintain their products separately from the Particl team or Particl Desktop releases schedules and according to their own terms.</p><h4 id=\"faster-rollout-for-updates-new-features-and-bug-fixes\">Faster rollout for updates, new features, and bug fixes</h4><p>Right now, a bug fix to a dApp such as Particl Marketplace requires an entire Particl Desktop client release. A bug fix under the new scenario can be rolled out as soon as the author feels it's ready, without needing to consider an entire client update or involve the Particl team.</p><p>That's because the bug fix, in that case, would be pushed not to the desktop client itself but to the precise module affected by it, which then gets automatically updated on all dApps that use that module.</p><p>This, again, takes the responsibility off of the Particl team and lets it focus on the greater vision while contributors can promptly push their own fixes and manage their apps without relying on the team's actions.</p><p>For example, if a dApp uses a Tor module to route traffic through Tor, it wouldn't need an ecosystem-wide update whenever Tor pushes an update to their network. The update would instead be automatically applied to the module, ensuring that all Particl dApps with Tor functionality are kept up-to-date with security fixes.</p><p>This is a major stride towards better dApp security and more timely updates.</p><h3 id=\"in-summary\">In Summary</h3><p>Particl's new modular architecture opens many doors, essentially transforming the Particl ecosystem into a privacy-conscious and decentralized foundation for the new internet.</p><p>This new approach can be broadly summarized in three key points:</p><ol><li>The Particl ecosystem isn't any more a single big block of code; instead, it is separated into independent modules, making it more open, accessible, and developer-friendly than ever. It is also more resilient against central points of failure.</li><li>Instead of requiring developers to re-implement all key functionalities, dApps can simply request it to a particular module without building everything or integrating everything from scratch, much like the example of mobile OSes and mobile apps we've highlighted just above.</li><li>DApps become entirely independent from the Particl team, the wider Particl ecosystem, and the access gateway on which they're made available.</li></ol><h2 id=\"3-access-gateways-and-dapp-accessibility\">3. Access Gateways and dApp Accessibility</h2><p>One of the most important goals of this new development cycle is to improve accessibility to Particl dApps so that they can be used by almost anyone, without complicated steps, and to stop relying exclusively on a single desktop application for all purposes. <strong>This third fold of Particl's strategic plan is a critical aspect in getting any sort of organic and sustained adoption.</strong></p><p>As such, Particl's new modular approach makes it much easier to integrate modules, or whole dApps, into different access gateways such as web or mobile frameworks or even into third-party applications.</p><h3 id=\"web-access\">Web Access</h3><p>However, <a href=\"https://particl.news/web3-exposed-is-it-only-a-mirage/\">as we’ve explored</a>, hosting dApps on top of the current and centralized web environment, while highly convenient, carries critical vulnerabilities and heavy downsides. With these challenges in mind, we plan on enabling alternative web hosting solutions, notably through SMSG 2.0’s content hosting capabilities.</p><p>Indeed, as we’ve mentioned earlier, SMSG 2.0 is scheduled to evolve from a distributed messaging protocol into a full-blown internet protocol more akin to something like Tor or i2p, eventually enabling dApps to be hosted on it and accessed from web browsers.</p><p>Of course, with Particl becoming so flexible and open to community contributors, we fully expect more traditional web and mobile versions of Particl dApps (i.e., Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap DEX, two-party escrow system, end-to-end encrypted messenger) to be made available. The team also intends to deliver such solutions to provide more options to the end-user.</p><h3 id=\"a-new-modular-particl-desktop\">A New Modular Particl Desktop</h3><p>Just like the rest of the ecosystem, Particl Desktop will become a modular client, enabling the end-user to add, remove, and configure dApps as they wish. This promotes openness and choice and ensures that users do not need to install every Particl dApp, some of which they may have no use for.</p><p>For example, one might not care about the Governance dApp, but the user is still currently forced to have it available because it is hard-coded into Particl Desktop. Alternatively, a user may not want to run the marketplace at all. Still, they are required to do so and, by the same process, spend computer resources decrypting all SMSG messages related to it (i.e., listings).</p><p>With a modular approach, the user could simply remove the marketplace dApp from their Particl Desktop application or simply never have to install it in the first place.</p><h4 id=\"dapp-store\">DApp Store</h4><p>To promote Particl’s vision, a “dApp store” may be made available, on which a list of official or recommended dApps would be featured with the ability for independent contributors to push their own dApps and modules to it.</p><p>Of course, in the spirit of openness and decentralization, the dApp store will be a convenient but optional platform for interacting with those dApps. As open-source applications, it will be possible to download or install them via other ways as well.</p><h2 id=\"4-currency-and-protocol-agnosticism\">4. Currency and Protocol Agnosticism</h2><p>To further promote openness and become an all-inclusive foundation for the internet of tomorrow, Particl is fully embracing the concept of agnosticism by ensuring its ecosystem can remain compatible with other cryptocurrencies and protocols. <strong>This is the fourth fold of Particl's strategic plan</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"currency-agnosticism\">Currency Agnosticism</h3><p>As part of the range of modules available to developers will be cryptocurrency-specific modules that makes it possible for certain dApps to support other cryptocurrencies (i.e., Bitcoin).</p><p>Although not all cryptocurrencies may be able to use all Particl features and services (some of them requiring very specific functionality unique to the PART privacy coin), this will extend the ecosystem's reach by welcoming other cryptocurrency communities and providing them with more utility for their coin.</p><p>When a cryptocurrency cannot use a specific Particl functionality, a swap module, like BasicSwap DEX, for example, can be added to let the end-user swap their coins for PART or even have the dApp execute that action automatically as a background process. This will allow holders of other cryptocurrencies to seamlessly benefit from Particl-specific features without negatively affecting the user experience.</p><p>In the exact same way, a fiat gateway module, such as a service offering credit card purchases of cryptocurrencies, can be added to the ecosystem and leveraged by dApp developers to provide added functionality to their products — further bridging the gap between the legacy payment industry and the world of cryptocurrencies.</p><h3 id=\"protocol-agnosticism\">Protocol Agnosticism</h3><p>Because dApps are developed using modules, it is possible to leverage protocols that are not native to the Particl ecosystem to build some of their features.</p><p>For example, SMSG provides chat functionality to dApps through its messaging module. But a developer could decide to instead integrate a different messaging protocol, like <a href=\"https://matrix.org/\">matrix</a>, which powers the <a href=\"https://riot.im/app/#/room/#particl-project:matrix.org\">Element Messenger</a>. This would still grant the dApp with messaging capabilities, but a different protocol would power it.</p><p>There are three main reasons behind this approach. For one, distinct protocols have different pros and cons. Some use cases may get more out of a particular protocol, while a different dApp may find it more efficient to use another. This gives more flexibility to developers and lets them work with what they think is in the best interest of their users.</p><p>Secondly, it makes Particl dApps more resistant to the test of time. As technology evolves very rapidly, it is not rare to see major protocol innovations appear. And because it's likely that, over time, better versions of protocols used to build dApps become available, developers require the ability to seamlessly swap protocols to keep up with the evolutionary curve. In other words, it makes it significantly easier to keep Particl dApps up-to-date with the most recent progress in the space, ensuring the user gets the most of what is possible at the time that they use a dApp.</p><p>Finally, it also makes dApps more secure and resilient against attacks. For example, if a vulnerability is found in the protocol powering a certain dApp, its developer can simply swap the faulty module for an unaffected alternative. This lets developers act quickly when there are security issues while preserving the integrity of the other components of a dApp.</p><h2 id=\"new-particl-dapps-are-coming-around\">New Particl dApps are Coming Around</h2><p>Particl’s new modular approach opens up a ton of opportunities. Not only does it enable more efficient and secure dApps, but it also completely opens up its development process to the world.</p><p>Moreover, with <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io\">Particl’s CCS platform</a>, anyone can publish proposals seeking to fund the development of various dApps, creating a fully self-perpetuating economy and environment. And we know the Particl community is not short of ideas! Indeed, once the modular architecture is deployed, we fully expect to see a rapid increase in the number of community-led initiatives.</p><p>That being said, the Particl team will, of course, be working on its own dApps not only to showcase what is possible with the improved Particl infrastructure but also to lead the way towards a better, fairer digital world for all.</p><p>Here are dApps or services the Particl team will work on once different components of the modular infrastructure go live.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center full light-one\" id=\"btn-add_01\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"col\">\n    <div class=\"tabs\">\n      <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">New version of the marketplace</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            This development cycle changes the back-end of the ecosystem so much that a completely new version of the marketplace will need to be deployed.\n            <br><br>\n            More flexible, fast, and agnostic than the current version, it will offer the same functionality but in a much more accessible way. In addition, the marketplace will be designed so that its part, or its whole, can be integrated into different access gateways like a website, mobile application, or third-party integrations; all are cross-compatible.\n            <br><br>\n            Also, because of its cleaner, modular codebase, any future development, such as the development of new features, will be dramatically sped up from the current typical pace.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n        \n      <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck3\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck3\">Mobile version of the marketplace</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            In just a few years, mobile devices are expected to be the preferential way people shop online. How many times have any of us purchased goods on the internet using our phones? Countless times, we’re sure.\n            <br><br>\n            The reality, however, is different for sellers who, for the vast majority, manage their business from desktop or laptop computers.\n            <br><br>\n            That is why one of Particl’s first dApps will be a buyer-focused mobile version of Particl Marketplace. This dApp will use the new modular approach of the ecosystem and showcase the use of a mobile access gateway into which Particl dApps will then be able to be integrated.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck4\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck4\">Privacy-first messenger app</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Think Signal or Telegram, but 100% decentralized and open-source. A privacy-first messenger application could be deployed relatively easily on mobile and desktop environments. Moreover, because it only requires SMSG modules, such a dApp could likely become available before even the release of the new version of the marketplace, as the latter requires more modules to be put together in order to function and carries a higher level of complexity. After all, because SMSG’s messaging capability is expected to be used heavily in the future, it only makes sense to isolate it into a proper standalone app or module early on.\n            <br><br>\n            Besides, it will serve as an excellent showcase for the new SMSG 2.0 network and mobile access gateways.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck5\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck5\">Standalone escrow app and integrations</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            As a way to demonstrate the integrability of modules, the Particl team may work on a showcase in which a two-party escrow option becomes available on a new mobile wallet.\n            <br><br>\n            As we’ve discussed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://particl.news/an-overview-of-particls-two-party-escrow/\">here</a>, Particl’s novel two-party escrow system has a wide range of use cases, all the way to in-person trade, and enabling this type of escrow outside of Particl Marketplace will allow us to tap into and reach more of these possibilities.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck6\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck6\">Third-party integrations</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            The modular approach's integration potential works in two ways: it, for one, allows Particl dApps to be integrated into existing eCommerce platforms (i.e., a WooCommerce payment plugin with two-party escrow contracts), but it also allows third-party services to be integrated right into dApps as modules (i.e., a third-party inventory management system that a seller may be using on other platforms).\n            <br><br>\n            As such, you can expect, over time, a wide range of integrations to be made available on the Particl dApp store or other popular platforms — in the form of a WooCommerce plugin, for example.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n    </div><!-- tabs close-->\n  </div><!-- col close-->\n</div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h1 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h1><p>This new major development cycle is expected to last from 12 to 18 months, with the current team size, and start right after the release of <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-3-what-to-expect/\">Particl Desktop 3.3</a>.</p><p>However, the team has recently actively been looking for external funding and pitching to various investors.

The new versions of these products will be built in parallel to existing Particl dApps. Therefore, there will be no changes to the availability of current dApps while the improvements to the ecosystem are being made, and they will still be maintained as required. Only when new versions of these applications are launched will the legacy versions be deprecated.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n        \n      <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck3\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck3\">Does adding the ability to use other coins within the ecosystem render PART useless?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Absolutely not. PART is and will remain a critical component of the Particl ecosystem. It is what powers its transactional privacy and is a requirement for interacting with some of the more complex Particl smart contracts. Remember, what makes PART unique is that it possesses both privacy and flexibility, a key aspect to many functions provided by Particl dApps that other cryptocurrencies cannot replicate.\n            <br><br>\n            For example, while an application built using Particl modules may allow for Monero payments, Monero still cannot be used with something like Particl’s two-party escrow system. In that case, the dApp’s developer may instead use a payment module, then a swap module to allow users to easily swap their Monero for PART. This would let Monero users benefit from some of the more advanced marketplace functions, such as its escrow capabilities, while still interacting with it using Monero even if the payment ultimately settles in PART.\n            <br><br>\n            On the other hand, if a dApp requires simple payments to be made (for instance, sending Monero through messages sent via the upcoming messenger application), then it may be possible to use Monero directly without having to route the payment through PART.\n            <br><br>\n            We aim to build an open and free ecosystem for all; forcing people to use a single cryptocurrency when they could be using others goes against that ethos. By opening up the Particl ecosystem to the wider cryptocurrency community, we significantly increase the range of potential Particl dApps users and successfully bring new levels of liberty and privacy to more people. After all, this is Particl’s fundamental mission. \n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck4\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck4\">Doesn’t this evolutionary process open up the door for more centralization?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Because Particl is about to become much more open-ended and easy to work with, businesses or independent developers may be interested in coding dApps that are more centralized than, for example, the current version of Particl Marketplace (which makes no compromise whatsoever on that end). But at the end of the day, it becomes up to the user to use that \"more centralized\" service or a more open/decentralized/private service instead, basing their decision on what's best for them.\n            <br><br>\n            Nonetheless, even when accounting for future, more centralized applications, their inclusion in the ecosystem brings considerable benefits at the level of decentralization.\n            <br><br>\n            First, it decentralizes the development process of the entire ecosystem by giving easy-to-use tools for developers and business people all around the world. No more will the platform's growth entirely depend on the core Particl development team — the new open and modular infrastructure will make it very easy for anyone to work on their own vision of Particl. This also radically improves the resilience of the network as a whole.\n            <br><br>\n            Secondly, combined with the CCS crowdfunding platform, this will positively impact the amount and efficiency of contributions from the community as it will be possible to self-fund great ideas using the treasury system, then realize them using easy-to-use dev tools. Particl is blessed to have a strong community that often comes up with great and revolutionary ideas, which we, the Particl team, are excited about but unable to give the time they would require (because of the current maintenance requirements and our own roadmap). This new evolutionary leap forward fixes that obstacle.\n            <br><br>\n            The evolution of Particl's architecture to a modular one changes everything and gives all the power to users. Anyone with a great idea or who wishes to create a certain dApp on Particl can easily submit a proposal, get it approved by the community for funding, and either code it themselves or find a third-party developer to do it. Using modules, bringing an idea to life will be possible for almost any Web3 developer.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck6\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck6\">Does Particl have the funds required to make all of that happen?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Although the current price of PART presents a challenge in terms of growth for the team, we’ve got enough funds to last for the duration of this development cycle at the current pace.\n            <br><br>\n            However, we've recently been actively working on raising funds from external investors to complement the monthly claims from the network's treasury and accelerate our progress. Although we cannot reveal more information about it at this time, we will publish our pitch deck and Particl's new whitepaper, which we're both using to pitch, shortly into the future.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck7\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck7\">How does the team expects to deliver on this with its small size? Any plans to grow the team?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            An aspect of this development cycle's strategy is to grow the development team to help on the various components and dApp projects. But, of course, this is highly contingent on the amount of funding at our disposal, whether through better PART prices or external funding. This is why we've recently made raising funds one of our top priorities.\n            <br><br>\n            Besides, one of the critical goal of this cycle is to further decentralize the development process to allow more independent developers to contribute to the ecosystem on their own. This will reduce the burden on the Particl team and allow for more people to help the network grow. \n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck8\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck8\">What about marketing in all of this?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Again, the scale and timing of marketing efforts is equally contingent on the amount of funding at the team's disposal. And although this evolutionary leap forward is mostly development-focused — as it deals with foundational work — we still have different marketing and communications initiatives ready to deploy as soon as financial capabilities permit.\n            <br><br>\n            But, at its core, this \"foundational phase\" is a necessary step that will result in much more accessible, user-friendly, and convenient dApps — a critical factor that affects both user acquisition and retention, and also leads to better marketing ROI. For this reason, it is, in many ways, a long-term play towards future marketing and outreach efforts, ensuring Particl dApps live up to the hype of the marketing efforts that will promote them.\n            <br><br>\n            In addition, this entire phase expands on the ecosystem’s use cases and target audiences — essentially vastly increasing our pool of potential users. The team fully expects to capitalize on this opportunity by carefully and gradually increasing marketing and outreach efforts as we progress through this cycle’s critical milestones, notably as we incrementally release new products and major updates.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck9\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck9\">Does that mean that dApps like Particl Marketplace could be integrated into other cryptocurrency wallets?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Yes. Even further, it means that any Particl dApp can be ‘white labeled’ or re-interpreted by anyone. A cryptocurrency project could, for example, integrate Particl Marketplace into its own coin wallet, take out the escrow, and force payments to be made exclusively using their cryptocurrency. Then, to pay for the SMSG anti-spam fee, they could simply build a system around a swap module like BasicSwap to automatically and seamlessly exchange their native coin to PART to pay for listing fees. \n            <br><br>\n            In fact, there is great potential for these sorts of projects. Third-party integrations and white-labeled solutions can help more communities thrive by reaping the network's liberty and privacy benefits. It can also generate revenue for the project in a way that's mutually beneficial for all parties involved. This will be an important aspect of Particl's adoption and go-to-market strategy as we incrementally release new products.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat2_chck10\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat2_chck10\">Will the current version of SMSG be deprecated?</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            No, SMSG 1.0 is not planned to be deprecated for the moment, even when SMSG 2.0 comes out.

However, this time estimate will likely improve as we gradually grow the team and fill various key positions following a successful funding round. However, it's important to note that these months spent working through this development phase will be far from uneventful as we have planned several incremental releases. Therefore, 12 to 18 months is the estimate for the entire process to be over, but in the meantime, you can expect different exciting releases to keep things very interesting.\n            <br><br>\n            For example, while it may take longer to release the new version of Particl Marketplace, largely due to its complexity and the sheer number of modules it uses, SMSG 2.0 or the privacy-first messenger app might launch before that time. That’s because the new version of Particl Marketplace uses many different modules which, individually, will be ready at different points in time. \n            <br><br>\n            In the case of the privacy-first messenger app, it is, at its core, a much simpler dApp. Because it uses fewer modules than Particl Marketplace, it would be much easier and quicker to deploy. And since the messaging function of SMSG is expected to be leveraged by many future dApp, it only makes sense to deploy it early on into the process.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n    </div><!-- tabs close-->\n  </div><!-- col close-->\n</div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html-->","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":["kg-card","kg-image-card","kg-width-wide"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"/glink/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg","className":["kg-image"],"alt":"","srcSet":["/glink/size/w600/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 600w","/glink/size/w1000/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 1000w","/glink/size/w1600/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 1600w","/glink/2022/08/Leap_Forward_Blog.jpg 1920w"],"sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"If you’ve been following Particl closely, then you may have heard whispers that the Particl team is gearing up to undertake a new major development cycle.

You can always keep track\nof those changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis has been a productive week for BasicSwap in general. We've kept on working\non the various security tests to ensure that everything functions as it should\nand that as many edge cases as possible are covered. As always, you can follow\nthe progress by checking out the Github commits here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/commits/master].\n\nWe've also been making good, steady progress on the user interface. At this\npoint, it looks likely that it will be complete by next week and that we'll be\nable to initiate one last round of testing before going public with the beta!\n\nWe've also kept busy building a proper landing page for BasicSwap. The DEX's\nwebsite is intended to communicate the value proposition of the DEX in a quick\nand user-friendly manner and will go a long way in growing the project. The\nwebsite is scheduled to release at the same time as the beta. \n\nWrapped PART Token Now Live!\nEarlier this week, the community deployed a self-drived initiative that makes\nPART available on the Binance Smart Chain as a wrapped asset. \n\nContract Address 0x332a334cb631061298c6fe0da1a1b7a337ef5c72 | BscScanThe\nContract Address 0x332a334cb631061298c6fe0da1a1b7a337ef5c72 page allows users\nto\nview the source code, transactions, balances, and analytics for the contract\naddress.

This initiative expands Particl's utility and opens up more\nopportunities, notably with the addition of wPART to BSC's most popular DEX: \nPancakeSwap [https://pancakeswap.finance]. Note that, to be able to use PART on\nPancakeSwap, you need to manually input its contract address displayed just\nbelow.\n\nwPART's contract address: 0x332A334cb631061298c6Fe0da1a1B7a337eF5C72\n\n * To add liquidity on PancakeSwap, follow this link\n   [https://pancakeswap.finance/add] and select the pairing token(s) you want to\n   support (i.e., BUSD, BNB, etc).\n * To bring wPART to other chains, you can various different bridges such as \n   cbridge [https://cbridge.celer.network/#/transfer].\n\nNote: wPART is deployed by wrapping.services, a centralized wrapping service\nprovider. For this reason, we highly recommend to exercise caution when\nconverting PART into wPART and do your own research. Additionally, be careful of\nwhich dApps you use when interacting with other networks. Even though these\ntypes of blockchain provide a lot of utility, they also host many dApps that\nhave either been hacked, exploited, or proven as scams over time.
