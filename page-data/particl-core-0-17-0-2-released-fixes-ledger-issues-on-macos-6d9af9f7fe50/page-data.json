Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\nIs Making a Listing Pool for Vendors to Make Their First Listings Free Possible?\nTo fight off spammers, all Particl listings require users to submit a small\nlisting fee. This feature is important in fighting off spam as it makes it\nunprofitable for the attacker to do so, at least when done on a larger scale.\nTaking the listing fee out of the equation would leave an opportunity for\nspammers to mess with the network and potentially even defraud the funds\ncontained in the “Free Listing Pool”. Note that we’re currently going over many\nstrategies to help with and kickstart the adoption of the coming marketplace and\nthat we are aware a strategy needs to be adopted to not end up with a difficult\n“Chicken and Egg” problem that is observable sometimes with other marketplaces,\ndecentralized or not.\n\nWhen is the Marketplace Coming on Mainnet?\nParticl Marketplace Alpha (Early October Version)Particl Marketplace Alpha is\nalready out, though it is a testnet-only version. We’ve also released new builds\nthis week that shows the good progress being made on it. If you want to test it\nout, scroll down to the News & Updates section of this Community Update to find\nthe link to the blog post containing the builds.\n\nThe requirements for Particl Marketplace to be released on mainnet is mainly\ndecentralized governance, which is almost ready and can be tested on testnet,\nand RingCT, which has been ready ever since we launched Particl. Other features\nsuch as private markets and private listings are also scheduled for the first\nversion of the marketplace and are well under development. Finally, the testnet\nBeta version of the marketplace (which should contain most, if not all, of the\nmainnet features) should be super stable and devoid of notable bugs.\n\nAs we have three separate development teams (Core, Marketplace, and Desktop),\neach of them working on specific aspects of the Particl platform, giving\ndeadlines is difficult because there are a lot of moving pieces, each one of\nthem having the potential to affect other pieces. Ideally, we’re looking for the\nmonth of November/December for the release of Particl Marketplace Beta, which\nwill also be a testnet version, although that is not a fixed date or deadline of\nany kind. Rest assured that we will take the appropriate steps to let everyone\nknow when we are about to release on mainnet and promote this milestone event as\nit should.\n\nWhen’s the RingCT Hardfork?\nRingCT has been ready for mainnet ever since we launched Particl, but we’ve\ndecided to instead have it properly audited and reviewed to make sure our\nimplementation of it, the first ever done on any other codebase other than\nCryptonote, was secure and trustworthy. As such, we’ve had the implementation\nacademically reviewed by the NJIT Department of Technology and audited by WSA.\nNote that WSA is currently undergoing a second, more thorough audit of the code\nas they requested.\n\nThe requirements for RingCT to be put on mainnet is for the governance system to\nbe fully completed. Similarly to our first hardfork which moved cold staking on\nmainnet, we will likely give a 4-week notice to the community prior to doing it.\nThis should give enough time for most Particl users to be aware of that fact and\nupdate their node in time. This process should be made much easier by the fact\nthat both Particl Desktop and Partyman clients have built-in features to either\nautomatically update Particl Core or block access to features until it is\nupdated to the latest version.\n\nAny plans on Presenting/Attending Events?\nYes. The entire team is going to meet in South Africa during the month of\nNovember for our quarterly team summit. Usually, this summit is mostly focused\non development strategies. This time, however, we’re also bringing the\nCommunications Team over to strategize the future and, most importantly, the\nroad to Particl Marketplace’s mainnet release. This is going to be a milestone\nmeeting for the team as it is going to be the first time most of the team is\ngoing to be at the same place, at the same time. This should prove to be a great\nopportunity to really nail down the launch strategy and get everybody on sync.\n\nOne of the important and main topics that will be discussed during this series\nof meetings is going to be our presence at conferences and getting more exposure\nwithin the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry itself. For example, we’d like\nto organize a launch party at a popular cryptocurrency conference that we’d be\nsponsoring. The idea would be to present Particl Marketplace to a wide audience\nand then end the presentation by actually launching mainnet live. We have a lot\nof similar ideas brewing up, and we’re very excited to be able to meet in person\nin November and really finalize that launch strategy.\n\nWe’ve also started to support ambassadors and initiatives from the community as\nit relates to meetups. As we mentioned in the last Community Update, we’ve had\ncommunity member JoaquimF organize a meetup in São Paulo, Brazil, and we’ve also\nreceived a LOT of interest from our French community for a France-based meetup\nwhich is already in the works.\n\nIt’s also important to note that, as the Particl Foundation has been extremely\ndiligent and careful with their funds, we’ll have the resources required to\nproperly plan and fund our Particl Marketplace launch strategy. We’ll have more\ndetails about it once we come back from our week of meetings in South Africa.\n\nWhat Efforts are Made to Attract a Public Figure for Particl?\nAt the moment, we are not actively looking for a public speaker or figure to\nrepresent Particl. This may end up being part of our marketing strategy after we\nraise funds through our Primary Funding Round, but is not a short-term focus.\n\nThat being said, Particl is a true open-source project and as such, we strongly\nencourage anyone from the community to step up. We’ll offer support to any\nserious community member looking to represent Particl at public events, be it\nlocal meetups or conferences. If you are a good public speaker and want to step\nup, don’t hesitate to contact us and we’ll make sure to find ways to involve\nyou!\n\nWill There Be a Launch Event?\nAbsolutely! We’d like to sponsor a main event for a big conference where we’d be\nlaunching the marketplace on mainnet live. I’d be a great way to reveal the\nmarketplace to a large audience and get exposure from big players, investors,\nand cryptocurrency enthusiasts. We have a lot of ideas for this launch event and\nwe are quite excited to craft an exciting and fun launch strategy. The mainnet\nrelease of Particl Marketplace is a huge milestone for the Particl project, and\nwe want to make the launch event as big as the release is.\n\nAre Efforts Being Made to Create a Particl Documentary?\nNot at this time.\n\nIs Particl’s Treasurer Buying PART at These Prices?\nNo. The Particl team doesn’t hold any coin, the Particl Foundation does. The\nFoundation cannot trade coins speculatively. Moreover, all of the Foundation’s\naccounts are known and publicly auditable, and any transaction can be tracked.\n\nWill Particl Consider Changing its Setup and Switch to a Two-Token Mechanism?\nWe have no plan to do so at the moment, but as our team is constantly looking\nfor improvements, it may come at a later time in our roadmap if that ever makes\nsense to do so. In other words, we are not against it, but it is not within our\nshort-term vision or requirements for the moment.\n\nWill Ryno be Actively Coding on Particl?\nAs Ryno said himself earlier this year during our livestream, he is now more\ninvolved in the management side of things rather than the coding side of thing.\nHe puts in a lot of work for the project right now and oversees that both the\ndevelopment and the business management/organizational side of the project goes\non smoothly. He’s a big part of the core team and an important decision maker.\n\nWhen Will the BitcoinTalk Thread be Updated?\nIt’s one of our backlog items, and we have to pick which item we want to tackle\nfirst on a priority basis. As BitcoinTalk isn’t as popular as it used to be,\nwe’re focusing on stuff that is more urgent in the short-term and stuff we think\nwill have a more important impact on the project. We are aware the thread header\nneeds to be updated, and it will come once we reach that item after tackling\nmore important tasks.\n\nWe again strongly encourage and support community members stepping up and\noffering help. If you want to contribute, let us know, it helps a ton!\n\nDoes Particl Plan on Getting on More Exchanges?\nYes, especially decentralized exchanges. We are working on new exchange deals\nright now and are looking at bigger exchanges like Circle, CoinBase, Binance, a\nhandful of long-standing ones. It is important for us each exchange on which we\nwant to be listed is approved by our legal team and that they be larger, more\nestablished exchange. Exchanges do reach out to us from time to time, ask\npointed questions, but in the end, there are always two parties involved.\nThere’s also a lot of research being done on our end for each exchange,\nincluding looking at how other coins are doing on this exchange, how it\nbenefited them, looking at if the volume is legit or faked, and etc.\n\nIt does look like the mindset of some exchanges is changing and we are hopeful\nthey are starting to look and list valuable projects that will benefit the space\nrather than any ICO able to pay for listing fees.\n\nHave Funds Been Made Available for the Binance Application?\nNo, funds have not been made available for any exchange including Binance, but\neach exchange is a case-by-case and every proposal from serious exchanges is\nbeing considered. Getting on smaller exchanges, however, especially when those\nask for a listing fee, is not something we are interested in as we do not\nbelieve the impact to be big enough for Particl.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nNew Testnet Marketplace Builds Available\nMarketplace | Community Test Build 2018–10–16\n[https://particl.news/marketplace-community-test-build-2018-10-16-b2a9fd913a3c]\nParticl development teams have been hard at work adding additional features and\ninterface experiences to Particl…\n[https://particl.news/marketplace-community-test-build-2018-10-16-b2a9fd913a3c]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/marketplace-community-test-build-2018-10-16-b2a9fd913a3c]\n\nListing governance has been added to the marketplaceOn Tuesday, we released new\nmarketplace testnet builds.

A few items have been moved around and some\nwere added to the report. For example, the report shows a new Particl Desktop\nfeature, adjustable ring size value, is now completed. It also shows that all of\nthe Settings features have now been moved to the Waiting for Review category,\nmeaning they are just about to be included in future public testnet builds.\n\nPrivate MarketsOne quite interesting development in the past two weeks have been\nthe layouts for the coming private markets and listings feature that will be\nincluded in the first mainnet version of Particl Marketplace. A screenshot of\nthe Private Markets page has been shared this week, and more exist. We will\nrelease more of them when we are sure that they aren’t going to be changed\nbefore actual implementation.\n\nParticl Core 0.17.0.2 is Out — Fixes Ledger Issues for MacOS Users\nParticl Core 0.17.0.2 Released — Fixes Ledger Issues on MacOS\n[https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-2-released-fixes-ledger-issues-on-macos-6d9af9f7fe50]\nYesterday, we released Particl Core 0.17.0.2, an update that fixes\nLedger-related issues some MacOS users have been…\n[https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-2-released-fixes-ledger-issues-on-macos-6d9af9f7fe50]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-2-released-fixes-ledger-issues-on-macos-6d9af9f7fe50]\n\nWe’ve also released on the same Particl Core 0.17.0.2, an update that fixes\nLedger-related issues some MacOS users have been experiencing.\n\nIn other words, you shouldn’t have any issue anymore when trying to use your\nLedger hardware device on MacOS.

This feature is important in fighting off spam as it makes it unprofitable for the attacker to do so, at least when done on a larger scale. Taking the listing fee out of the equation would leave an opportunity for spammers to mess with the network and potentially even defraud the funds contained in the “Free Listing Pool”. Note that we’re currently going over many strategies to help with and kickstart the adoption of the coming marketplace and that we are aware a strategy needs to be adopted to not end up with a difficult “Chicken and Egg” problem that is observable sometimes with other marketplaces, decentralized or not.</p><h3 id=\"when-is-the-marketplace-coming-on-mainnet\"><strong>When is the Marketplace Coming on Mainnet?</strong></h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--9/1-HwPakrwxuZXK7Viru1THcQ.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl Marketplace Alpha (Early October Version)</figcaption></figure><p>Particl Marketplace Alpha is already out, though it is a testnet-only version. We’ve also released new builds this week that shows the good progress being made on it. If you want to test it out, scroll down to the <em>News &amp; Updates </em>section of this Community Update to find the link to the blog post containing the builds.</p><p>The requirements for Particl Marketplace to be released on mainnet is mainly decentralized governance, which is almost ready and can be tested on testnet, and RingCT, which has been ready ever since we launched Particl. Other features such as private markets and private listings are also scheduled for the first version of the marketplace and are well under development. Finally, the testnet Beta version of the marketplace (which should contain most, if not all, of the mainnet features) should be super stable and devoid of notable bugs.</p><p>As we have three separate development teams (Core, Marketplace, and Desktop), each of them working on specific aspects of the Particl platform, giving deadlines is difficult because there are a lot of moving pieces, each one of them having the potential to affect other pieces. Ideally, we’re looking for the month of November/December for the release of Particl Marketplace Beta, which will also be a testnet version, although that is not a fixed date or deadline of any kind. Rest assured that we will take the appropriate steps to let everyone know when we are about to release on mainnet and promote this milestone event as it should.</p><h3 id=\"when-s-the-ringct-hardfork\">When’s the RingCT Hardfork?</h3><p>RingCT has been ready for mainnet ever since we launched Particl, but we’ve decided to instead have it properly audited and reviewed to make sure our implementation of it, the first ever done on any other codebase other than Cryptonote, was secure and trustworthy. As such, we’ve had the implementation academically reviewed by the NJIT Department of Technology and audited by WSA. Note that WSA is currently undergoing a second, more thorough audit of the code as they requested.</p><p>The requirements for RingCT to be put on mainnet is for the governance system to be fully completed. Similarly to our first hardfork which moved cold staking on mainnet, we will likely give a 4-week notice to the community prior to doing it. This should give enough time for most Particl users to be aware of that fact and update their node in time. This process should be made much easier by the fact that both Particl Desktop and Partyman clients have built-in features to either automatically update Particl Core or block access to features until it is updated to the latest version.</p><h3 id=\"any-plans-on-presenting-attending-events\">Any plans on Presenting/Attending Events?</h3><p>Yes. The entire team is going to meet in South Africa during the month of November for our quarterly team summit. Usually, this summit is mostly focused on development strategies. This time, however, we’re also bringing the Communications Team over to strategize the future and, most importantly, the road to Particl Marketplace’s mainnet release. This is going to be a milestone meeting for the team as it is going to be the first time most of the team is going to be at the same place, at the same time. This should prove to be a great opportunity to really nail down the launch strategy and get everybody on sync.</p><p>One of the important and main topics that will be discussed during this series of meetings is going to be our presence at conferences and getting more exposure within the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry itself. For example, we’d like to organize a launch party at a popular cryptocurrency conference that we’d be sponsoring. The idea would be to present Particl Marketplace to a wide audience and then end the presentation by actually launching mainnet live. We have a lot of similar ideas brewing up, and we’re very excited to be able to meet in person in November and really finalize that launch strategy.</p><p>We’ve also started to support ambassadors and initiatives from the community as it relates to meetups. As we mentioned in the last Community Update, we’ve had community member JoaquimF organize a meetup in São Paulo, Brazil, and we’ve also received a LOT of interest from our French community for a France-based meetup which is already in the works.</p><p>It’s also important to note that, as the Particl Foundation has been extremely diligent and careful with their funds, we’ll have the resources required to properly plan and fund our Particl Marketplace launch strategy. We’ll have more details about it once we come back from our week of meetings in South Africa.</p><h3 id=\"what-efforts-are-made-to-attract-a-public-figure-for-particl\">What Efforts are Made to Attract a Public Figure for Particl?</h3><p>At the moment, we are not actively looking for a public speaker or figure to represent Particl. This may end up being part of our marketing strategy after we raise funds through our Primary Funding Round, but is not a short-term focus.</p><p>That being said, Particl is a true open-source project and as such, we strongly encourage anyone from the community to step up. We’ll offer support to any serious community member looking to represent Particl at public events, be it local meetups or conferences. If you are a good public speaker and want to step up, don’t hesitate to contact us and we’ll make sure to find ways to involve you!</p><h3 id=\"will-there-be-a-launch-event\">Will There Be a Launch Event?</h3><p>Absolutely! We’d like to sponsor a main event for a big conference where we’d be launching the marketplace on mainnet live. I’d be a great way to reveal the marketplace to a large audience and get exposure from big players, investors, and cryptocurrency enthusiasts. We have a lot of ideas for this launch event and we are quite excited to craft an exciting and fun launch strategy. The mainnet release of Particl Marketplace is a huge milestone for the Particl project, and we want to make the launch event as big as the release is.</p><h3 id=\"are-efforts-being-made-to-create-a-particl-documentary\">Are Efforts Being Made to Create a Particl Documentary?</h3><p>Not at this time.</p><h3 id=\"is-particl-s-treasurer-buying-part-at-these-prices\">Is Particl’s Treasurer Buying PART at These Prices?</h3><p>No. The Particl team doesn’t hold any coin, the Particl Foundation does. The Foundation cannot trade coins speculatively. Moreover, all of the Foundation’s accounts are known and publicly auditable, and any transaction can be tracked.</p><h3 id=\"will-particl-consider-changing-its-setup-and-switch-to-a-two-token-mechanism\">Will Particl Consider Changing its Setup and Switch to a Two-Token Mechanism?</h3><p>We have no plan to do so at the moment, but as our team is constantly looking for improvements, it may come at a later time in our roadmap if that ever makes sense to do so. In other words, we are not against it, but it is not within our short-term vision or requirements for the moment.</p><h3 id=\"will-ryno-be-actively-coding-on-particl\">Will Ryno be Actively Coding on Particl?</h3><p>As Ryno said himself earlier this year during our livestream, he is now more involved in the management side of things rather than the coding side of thing. He puts in a lot of work for the project right now and oversees that both the development and the business management/organizational side of the project goes on smoothly. He’s a big part of the core team and an important decision maker.</p><h3 id=\"when-will-the-bitcointalk-thread-be-updated\">When Will the BitcoinTalk Thread be Updated?</h3><p>It’s one of our backlog items, and we have to pick which item we want to tackle first on a priority basis. As BitcoinTalk isn’t as popular as it used to be, we’re focusing on stuff that is more urgent in the short-term and stuff we think will have a more important impact on the project. We are aware the thread header needs to be updated, and it will come once we reach that item after tackling more important tasks.</p><p>We again strongly encourage and support community members stepping up and offering help. If you want to contribute, let us know, it helps a ton!</p><h3 id=\"does-particl-plan-on-getting-on-more-exchanges\">Does Particl Plan on Getting on More Exchanges?</h3><p>Yes, especially decentralized exchanges. We are working on new exchange deals right now and are looking at bigger exchanges like Circle, CoinBase, Binance, a handful of long-standing ones. It is important for us each exchange on which we want to be listed is approved by our legal team and that they be larger, more established exchange. Exchanges do reach out to us from time to time, ask pointed questions, but in the end, there are always two parties involved. There’s also a lot of research being done on our end for each exchange, including looking at how other coins are doing on this exchange, how it benefited them, looking at if the volume is legit or faked, and etc.</p><p>It does look like the mindset of some exchanges is changing and we are hopeful they are starting to look and list valuable projects that will benefit the space rather than any ICO able to pay for listing fees.</p><h3 id=\"have-funds-been-made-available-for-the-binance-application\">Have Funds Been Made Available for the Binance Application?</h3><p>No, funds have not been made available for any exchange including Binance, but each exchange is a case-by-case and every proposal from serious exchanges is being considered. Getting on smaller exchanges, however, especially when those ask for a listing fee, is not something we are interested in as we do not believe the impact to be big enough for Particl.</p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &amp; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"new-testnet-marketplace-builds-available\">New Testnet Marketplace Builds Available</h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/marketplace-community-test-build-2018-10-16-b2a9fd913a3c\"><strong>Marketplace | Community Test Build 2018–10–16</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/marketplace-community-test-build-2018-10-16-b2a9fd913a3c\"><em>Particl development teams have been hard at work adding additional features and interface experiences to Particl…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/marketplace-community-test-build-2018-10-16-b2a9fd913a3c\">particl.news</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--9/1-WnAqX3iaOMTJzurtdTn0LQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Listing governance has been added to the marketplace</figcaption></figure><p>On Tuesday, we released new marketplace testnet builds.

The Foundation cannot trade coins speculatively. Moreover, all of the Foundation’s accounts are known and publicly auditable, and any transaction can be tracked.</p><h3 id=\"will-particl-consider-changing-its-setup-and-switch-to-a-two-token-mechanism\">Will Particl Consider Changing its Setup and Switch to a Two-Token Mechanism?</h3><p>We have no plan to do so at the moment, but as our team is constantly looking for improvements, it may come at a later time in our roadmap if that ever makes sense to do so. In other words, we are not against it, but it is not within our short-term vision or requirements for the moment.</p><h3 id=\"will-ryno-be-actively-coding-on-particl\">Will Ryno be Actively Coding on Particl?</h3><p>As Ryno said himself earlier this year during our livestream, he is now more involved in the management side of things rather than the coding side of thing. He puts in a lot of work for the project right now and oversees that both the development and the business management/organizational side of the project goes on smoothly. He’s a big part of the core team and an important decision maker.</p><h3 id=\"when-will-the-bitcointalk-thread-be-updated\">When Will the BitcoinTalk Thread be Updated?</h3><p>It’s one of our backlog items, and we have to pick which item we want to tackle first on a priority basis. As BitcoinTalk isn’t as popular as it used to be, we’re focusing on stuff that is more urgent in the short-term and stuff we think will have a more important impact on the project. We are aware the thread header needs to be updated, and it will come once we reach that item after tackling more important tasks.</p><p>We again strongly encourage and support community members stepping up and offering help. If you want to contribute, let us know, it helps a ton!</p><h3 id=\"does-particl-plan-on-getting-on-more-exchanges\">Does Particl Plan on Getting on More Exchanges?</h3><p>Yes, especially decentralized exchanges. We are working on new exchange deals right now and are looking at bigger exchanges like Circle, CoinBase, Binance, a handful of long-standing ones. It is important for us each exchange on which we want to be listed is approved by our legal team and that they be larger, more established exchange. Exchanges do reach out to us from time to time, ask pointed questions, but in the end, there are always two parties involved. There’s also a lot of research being done on our end for each exchange, including looking at how other coins are doing on this exchange, how it benefited them, looking at if the volume is legit or faked, and etc.</p><p>It does look like the mindset of some exchanges is changing and we are hopeful they are starting to look and list valuable projects that will benefit the space rather than any ICO able to pay for listing fees.</p><h3 id=\"have-funds-been-made-available-for-the-binance-application\">Have Funds Been Made Available for the Binance Application?</h3><p>No, funds have not been made available for any exchange including Binance, but each exchange is a case-by-case and every proposal from serious exchanges is being considered. Getting on smaller exchanges, however, especially when those ask for a listing fee, is not something we are interested in as we do not believe the impact to be big enough for Particl.</p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &#x26; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"new-testnet-marketplace-builds-available\">New Testnet Marketplace Builds Available</h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/marketplace-community-test-build-2018-10-16-b2a9fd913a3c\"><strong>Marketplace | Community Test Build 2018–10–16</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/marketplace-community-test-build-2018-10-16-b2a9fd913a3c\"><em>Particl development teams have been hard at work adding additional features and interface experiences to Particl…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/marketplace-community-test-build-2018-10-16-b2a9fd913a3c\">particl.news</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--9/1-WnAqX3iaOMTJzurtdTn0LQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Listing governance has been added to the marketplace</figcaption></figure><p>On Tuesday, we released new marketplace testnet builds.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
