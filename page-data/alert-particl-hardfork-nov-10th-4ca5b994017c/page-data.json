Particl Foundation has been using Particl Copay to manage its affairs\nfor both BTC and PART since inception in July. Available on Google Play\n[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.particl.copay] and our Particl\nGithub repository [https://github.com/particl/copay/releases].\n\nQ3 2017 | Particl Electron Wallet App—News Update\n[https://particl.news/built-on-electron-we-proudly-introduce-particl-wallet-v0-1-0-4f312c3df41f]\n\nThe first official builds for this product were for testnet only. However,\neveryone has been free to compile this wallet for mainnet since its release in\nSeptember. The Particl team will be releasing their first official builds of our\nGUI release for mainnet this week. The past 5 weeks have been all hands on deck\nto ensure we have a beautiful, smooth wallet ready for Cold Staking.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nClosing Out\nQ4 2017 | Cold Staking—News Update\n[https://particl.news/alert-particl-hardfork-nov-10th-4ca5b994017c]\n\nThis Friday, Cold Staking will be activated on mainnet meaning it has graduated\nfrom the testing environment (testnet) into the arms of every user working on\nthe network!\n\nDon’t be left behind! You may be one of the nodes still running old protocol.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNew Additions\nQ4 2017 | Atomic Swaps\n\nThis quarter the PART blockchain will realize it’s not alone in this world! The\ngreat guys at Decred Project tested and approved the PR a couple weeks ago. Keep\na lookout for promotion of DCR/PART atomic swaps. We will continue to test and\ncollaborate cross chain transactions with other projects. This is a big part of\nour vision for the cryptoagnostic Marketplace\n[http://www.investopedia.com/news/how-cryptocurrency-agnosticism-could-impact-industry/]\n.\n\nAdd Particl Support by dasource · Pull Request #29 · decred/atomicswap\n[https://github.com/decred/atomicswap/pull/29]\nThis implements the partatomicswap command.

Above, we shared the new team\nmembers that are coming on to help us reach these goals.\n\nThis week also closes the last critical path item (cold staking) for public\nrelease so the team can focus 100% on the Privacy Marketplace. Case in point, a\nnew huge initial commit on paid SMSG code posted earlier today!\n\nInitial paid smsg code. · particl/particl-core@4596cf3\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commit/4596cf3139ac274df048197503857f85187ea0f0]\nNew -smsgsaddnewkeys option restores the old behaviour of searching for\nmessages\non all new keys Moved stake and…\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commit/4596cf3139ac274df048197503857f85187ea0f0]\ngithub.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commit/4596cf3139ac274df048197503857f85187ea0f0]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore 3rd-Party Integrations\nBeginning next week the Dev Team will be back full strength on the Marketplace\napplication. We are always in conversations with people with projects that will\nadd value to Particl. A big piece of the framework that makes up the Particl\nPlatform is having spending/trading/commerce flexibility between\ncryptocurrencies and off platform.\n\nWe’ve shared on Twitter our GUI integrations of some of the popular exchanges\nwe’ve built relationships with — Changelly and Shapeshift among others. These\nintegrations don’t require full-team input, typically just our Lead Core\nDeveloper Tecnovert’s expertise.\n\n> \nAs the opportunity presents itself we will push for valuable integrations that\nwill benefit the Particl Framework and our users. One to keep a lookout for is\nwith the team at Ledger.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResearch Grant\nOne of our token exchange milestones was to create a research grant with a major\nuniversity.\n\nGiven the resources and focus an education institution can bring to a privacy\nproject like Particl, we saw this as a way to leverage research students and\nfaculty towards decentralized marketplace economics.\n\nThe Foundation began November with a $35,000 donation to the New Jersey\nInstitute of Technology that gives us a focused team of students\n[https://web.njit.edu/~qiang/#student] and faculty lead by Assistant Professor \nQiang Tang [http://cs.njit.edu/people/qiang-tang].\n\nHis team will spend 6 months combing over privacy enhancements Particl has added\non top of Bitcoin such as Ring Signature Confidential Transactions (RingCT) and\nfocused research surrounding decentralized marketplaces, privacy and user\nacquisition/localization strategies.\n\nProfessor Tang’s research interests lie in applied & theoretical cryptography,\nprivacy and computer security. In particular: blockchain technology,\npost-Snowden cryptography, accountability, and information theoretic security.\n\nWhen looking for a qualified group of academics to focus on privacy on Particl’s\nblockchain we were very impressed by Qiang’s own research — which we encourage\nanyone to take the time to read through some of his papers and publications.\n\nQiang Tang [https://web.njit.edu/~qiang/#paper]\n2017.10.

Indeed, at 00:00\nUTC, the Particl blockchain will hardfork to bring many critical changes to its\nProof-of-Stake protocol, insuring that its foundation is as strong and secure as\npossible before the long-awaited Particl privacy marketplace is released. The\ntwo main changes to the protocol are the introduction of cold staking and a\ndramatic increase in quantum computer resistance. The hardfork also enables\nprotocol support for staking pools and staking rewards management, meaning that\nwhile they will now be able to be implemented, they will not be present at the\ntime of the fork.\n\nParticl’s 10th of November Hardfork in one imageCold Staking\nThe main feature the hardfork will bring to Particl’s Proof-of-Stake protocol is\nthe ability to securely delegate staking powers to “staking nodes”. The purpose\nof these “staking nodes” is to provide a dedicated resource connected to the\nParticl blockchain and stake on behalf of another wallet without being able to\nspend its coins.\n\nThe reason it is called “cold staking” is because this feature is intended to be\nused in combination with cold/hardware/paper wallets as well as multisig\naddresses, making it possible to stake “offline” coins with no risk of being\nhacked.\n\nStaking nodes can be set up on public/cloud servers, virtual machines or even on\nRPIs. The staking environment theoretically doesn’t even need to be that much\nsecure since these nodes do not contain or cannot be linked to any coin, meaning\nthat you can pretty much stake from anywhere.\n\nIn the future, this feature is likely to become even more relevant when the\nParticl team will start developing the mobile wallet. This wallet is intended to\nhave most or all of the desktop features, but actually staking from a mobile\nphone is far from being ideal. Not only would the network connection be unstable\nat times, it would also use a lot of data as you’d need to constantly download\nevery blocks. With cold staking, you could simply stake your mobile funds from a\nRPI at home or any dedicated server and still get staking revenues from your\nmobile funds without busting the phone bill.\n\nQuantum Resistance\nCurrent Proof-of-Stake implementations have a vulnerability not present in\nProof-of-Work whereby they reveal the public key of staking addresses when they\nfind and sign blocks. The most dangerous attack by quantum computers is against\npublic key cryptography. On traditional computers, it takes on the order of 2128\nbasic operations to get Bitcoin private keys associated with Bitcoin public\nkeys. This number is so massively large that any attack using traditional\ncomputers is completely impractical. However, it is known for sure that it would\ntake a sufficiently large quantum computer on the order of only 1283 basic\nquantum operations to be able to break a Bitcoin key using Shor’s algorithm.\nThis might take some time, especially since the first quantum computers are\nlikely to be extremely slow, but it is still very practical. It could be\nestimated that it is maybe 2 to 5 years until quantum computers become an issue,\nbut any project that plans on staying relevant on a long period of time should\ntackle these vulnerabilities way before they become problematic.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that public keys are NOT public addresses. To reverse a\nprivate key from a public address, it would require more energy than what is\navailable in the universe, therefore a quantum hacker cannot just go pick public\naddresses with large amounts and reverse those.\n\nWhen a Particl block is created, the private key of the address that staked it\nis used to sign the block, effectively broadcasting its public key to the entire\nnetwork. After the hardfork, “staking nodes” that do not contain any coin will\nbe able to sign staked blocks on behalf of any wallet, hot or cold. Even if a\nquantum hacker successfully did reverse the staking node’s private key from its\npublic key, he would not find any coin to steal.\n\nStaking Pools (Protocol Support Only)\nOne very practical use case this hardfork enables is that it enables protocol\nsupport for staking pools. It means this feature will not be available at the\ntime of the fork, but is rendered possible to code due to the changes brought by\nthe hardfork.\n\nIt may not be immediately obvious why staking pools would be useful when you can\nsecurely stake from anywhere, but there are a couple of reasons some users may\nbe drawn towards using them. First of all, staking a low Particl balance may not\nalways be ideal. Since each staking reward is around 1.5 PART and the minimum\nyearly interest is 5%, there could be a lot of time in between staking rewards.\nFor example, if someone wanted to buy $500 worth of Particl priced at 25$, he\nwould end up with 20 PARTs. At 5% inflation rate, that person would earn around\n1 Particl a year, which is even less than a single staking reward.\n\nSimilarly to PoW mining where solo mining Bitcoin with a single GPU card is now\ncompletely impractical, users with small Particl balances could simply delegate\nstaking powers to pools and have them stake their coins on their behalf. As\nmentioned above, this will not be coded at the time of the fork, but it would be\npossible to configure staking nodes to be able to spend staking rewards only (no\naccess to the actual staking funds whatsoever).\n\nA pool operator could simply broadcast its staking node’s public key and have\nusers “connect” and stake from it. Since these nodes could spend the rewards but\nnot the staking funds, the pool operators could simply aggregate staking rewards\ninto their own wallets and make custom payouts (i.e. daily or small 0.05 PART\npayouts).\n\nAnother use-case for staking pools is that the entire process of setting up and\nmaintaining a secure staking node is outsourced to the pool operator. Users\nwould only need to “connect” to the staking pool and not have to worry about\nsetting up their own server/RPI. This is ideal for the less technical users that\nmay eventually end up using Particl.\n\nThe current problem with staking pools is the transaction fees. Since the goal\nis to send smaller than 1.5 PART payouts, there may be a point where sending\nvery small payouts would cost too much in terms of transaction fee. This is an\nissue that could easily be solved with the Lightning Network. Payment channels\ncould be opened between users and the pool wallets and could eventually achieve\nnear-zero transaction costs.\n\nStake To Alternative Address(es) (Protocol Support Only)\nA second powerful but underestimated feature the hardfork adds protocol support\nfor is the ability to fully manage staking rewards. This allows users to select\nwhere the rewards should go and in what percentage. This function will not be\ncoded at the time of the fork, but it will now be possible to do it.\n\nBy default, staking rewards are given to the same address that stake (find and\nsign) a block. With this “alternative address” feature enabled, users would be\nable to automatically have these staking rewards sent to any public addresses\nand in any percentage. This killer feature leverages the amazing power of the\nParticl Proof-of-Stake protocol and enables a brand new way to spend, invest and\ndonate money in a completely passive way. Here are a couple of examples that I\nbelieve could really help the Particl project make a name for itself:\n\n1) Passive donations to crypto influencers\nThis, in my opinion, is a very powerful grassroots marketing strategy. The idea\nis to have crypto public figures such as youtubers or crypto celebs get a\nParticl address and share it. Then any Particl staker can choose the\ninfluencer’s address as a receiver of X% of his staking rewards. If enough\nstakers participate, the aggregated effect could make these passive donations\nquite large. If a crypto youtuber received 500$ worth of Particl everyday for\nsome time, he’s for sure going to look in to the project at one point and the\nother and then maybe start talking about it.\n\n2) Passive funding of community initiatives\nAnother brilliant way to use this potential feature is by creating community\nfunds and bounties. If a community member has an idea for a Particl Dapp,\nwidget, integration or marketing idea he could simply set up a public address\nand have X% of his staking rewards sent to it. If his idea gains traction within\nthe community, other stakers could also start funding the initiative’s address\nand eventually create a sizable bounty to attract contributors. Combined with\nParticl’s decentralized voting, it is an entire decentralized ecosystem that\nenables the users to make things happen and get ideas funded without the need of\nany middleman.\n\n3) Passive donations to organizations\nThis use-case is a bit more philanthropic, but practical nonetheless. Passive\ndonations could be set up to any organization or charity that sets up a Particl\npublic address. These organizations could be, for example, ones that seeks to\nfight for privacy and security like the TOR organization or the EFF. Not only\nwould this help them accomplish their goals, but it would also be a good\nmarketing strategy as many of these organizations display/showcase their big\ndonors.\n\n4) Budgeting & Diversification\nMany addresses could be set up with different purposes and be passively funded\nusing Particl’s Proof-of-Stake protocol. This would make it easier for stakers\nto save or invest money and would be an ideal budgeting strategy. For example, a\nuser could set up a “Vacations Fund”, “Real Estate Downpayment Fund” or a\n“University Fund” and have any percentage of their daily staking rewards sent\nover there. Then, once they would reach their respective funding target, the\nfunds they hold could be traded for fiat and then used to fulfil the goal they\nwere initially created for. Alternatively, this same user could also set up a\n“Bitcoin Investment Fund” or “altcoin Investment Fund” where every week the\nPARTs they hold would be traded for BTCs or other altcoins using a GUI in-wallet\ntoken exchange application (such as Changelly, Shapeshift or flyp.me). This\nwould make it easy for stakers to diversify their holdings into different coins\nwhile at the same time providing exchanges with more liquidity and volume\n\nWhile not implemented yet, this is how Shapeshift would look on the\nParticl walletParticl currently has ~1.5 PART staking rewards and blocks of 2\nminutes, meaning that roughly 1080 PARTs are created everyday. Priced at 7.50$,\nit is worth $8,100 and this daily source of funds will keep growing in value as\nParticl’s price increases.

This number is so massively large that any attack using traditional computers is completely impractical. However, it is known for sure that it would take a sufficiently large quantum computer on the order of only 1283 basic quantum operations to be able to break a Bitcoin key using Shor’s algorithm. This might take some time, especially since the first quantum computers are likely to be extremely slow, but it is still very practical.

First of all, staking a low Particl balance may not always be ideal. Since each staking reward is around 1.5 PART and the minimum yearly interest is 5%, there could be a lot of time in between staking rewards. For example, if someone wanted to buy $500 worth of Particl priced at 25$, he would end up with 20 PARTs.

If enough stakers participate, the aggregated effect could make these passive donations quite large.

Then, once they would reach their respective funding target, the funds they hold could be traded for fiat and then used to fulfil the goal they were initially created for. Alternatively, this same user could also set up a “Bitcoin Investment Fund” or “altcoin Investment Fund” where every week the PARTs they hold would be traded for BTCs or other altcoins using a GUI in-wallet token exchange application (such as Changelly, Shapeshift or flyp.me).

SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
