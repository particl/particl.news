You\ncan download and install it now and benefit from the most current and\nstreamlined Particl user experience available.\n\nThis is an important milestone for the desktop client and the project as a\nwhole, as it brings us one step closer to our goal of having a more modular and\nefficient ecosystem.\n\nWe'll delve deeper into this topic in this blog post, so let's get started!\n\n * Download Particl Desktop 3.3: \n   https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSeparation of Particl Core and Desktop ?\nThe major takeaway from this update is the decoupling of the Particl blockchain\nfrom the desktop client.\n\nFrom the outset, Particl Desktop v1.0 was entirely linked with Particl Core.\nThat's because, at the time of its launch, the desktop client lacked the\nmarketplace dApp component and was purely designed as a cryptocurrency wallet.\nTo be more precise, the marketplace itself wasn't initially designed as a\nstandalone dApp, but rather an added set of functionalities to the Particl\nwallet.\n\nAs the years progressed, Particl's vision developed into a more ambitious goal,\nnecessitating an extensive transformation of the desktop client's unified\narchitecture into a more adaptive and flexible design.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.3 makes significant strides towards establishing an\nindependent relationship between Particl Core and the desktop client by\nseparating them entirely, allowing them to coexist and operate harmoniously as\ndistinct pieces of software.\n\nFirst Steps Towards Modularity ⚙️\nThe reasoning behind separating Particl Core and Desktop is the first step\ntowards a more modular, open, and developer-friendly ecosystem. It signals the\nbeginning of the client's transformation from a \"cryptocurrency wallet with\nextra features\" into a fully-fledged sandbox for privacy-first dApps. \n\nThis development is expected to take place through a series of incremental\nchanges all throughout the new development cycle, each update working towards\nachieving our objective of modularity, openness, and enhanced efficiency.\n\nTo learn more about Particl's new (and now current) development cycle, please\nrefer to this extensive blog post\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/] on the topic.\n\nParticl’s Next Evolutionary Leap ForwardLearn about the team’s new major\ndevelopment cycle and discover Particl’s upcoming open-source foundation for\nthe\ndevelopment and deployment of privacy-first dApps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/]General Bug Fixes\nand Improvements ?\nAside from this significant leap forward, this new release introduces a wide\nvariety of improvements, both architecturally and to the user experience. It\nalso and a few bugs and issues. You'll find the full changelog at the bottom of\nthis article. \n\nSeller Companion App is Next ?\nNow that Particl Desktop 3.3 is live on mainnet, work on the seller companion\napp begins. \n\nFor those who may have not seen it yet, here's an excerpt from one of our recent\nweekly development progress reports which outlines its nature and the planned\nfeatures for it.\n\n> The app will serve as an external inventory and order management system tailored\nfor Particl's \"power sellers\". It will enable sellers to create, manage, and\npublish listings, but also set up escrow rates, and manage shipping, orders, and\nchats. We also plan to add plenty of automation into the system — such as the\nauto-relisting of items, automated pricing updates, and auto-acceptance of\norders within specified parameters — to make selling on the marketplace more\nefficient and effortless.\n\nThe application will also allow sellers to connect their Particl inventory to\nexternal platforms, such as WooCommerce, to benefit from its multitude of\nfunctionality and flexible plugins. This will drastically reduce the workload of\nmanually maintaining marketplace content, especially when combined with\nautomated processes, and will make it much easier for sellers already selling\nstuff online to integrate Particl Marketplace as part of the range of platforms\nthey do business on. And of course, we fully expect it to grow the number of\nlistings available on the marketplace!\n\nThe app is set to be rolled out in successive feature updates, a notable step in\nthe direction of making Particl Marketplace more open and accessible, especially\nwhen paired with a web gateway later on during the coming development cycle. \n\nIn reality, it encapsulates the flexibility and cross-platform compatibility of\nParticl's proposed modular architecture, allowing the marketplace to connect\nwith other platforms and reach broader audiences with greater ease.\n\nAlthough this is a small — but important — piece of our marketplace dApp vision,\nit is a great example of what becomes possible with Particl as we progress\nthrough this infrastructural evolutionary phase.\n\nWe aim to make the entire ecosystem more accessible in the near future by\nintegrating new gateways, such as web access, and further developing its\ncomponents into open modules. This will result in Particl dApps being highly\nconvenient, accessible, and much easier to use.\n * Source: Particl Development Progress Report (03-02-2023)\n   [https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-03-02-2023/]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started\n * Download Particl Desktop 3.3: \n   https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0\n\nRelease Particl Desktop v3.3.0 · particl/particl-desktopParticl Desktop\nv3.3.0RELEASE INFORMATION BUILDPARTICL CORE (MIN VERSION)MARKETPLACE\nVERSIONWALLET VERSION 3.3.023.0.30.3.121.8.0 CHANGELOG[overview] [Linux OS]\nApplication name ...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0]For those\nunfamiliar with Particl, we highly recommend exploring the Particl Academy as an\ninformative guide and resource for using Particl Desktop and the Particl\nMarketplace.\n\nOpen Particl Academy [https://academy.particl.io]\n\nNotes\n * Your wallet needs to be unlocked to process buy and sell orders on the\n   marketplace.\n * If you spot any issue, bug, or area of improvement, please report it directly\n   on the Github Issues [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] \n   page.\n\nAdvanced Start-up\nFor those interested, launching the application via the terminal offers\nreal-time log data.

It is not recommended to edit these by hand, but they can\n   be useful if something goes wrong and a setting is unavailable.\n * Completed a significant refactor to help move towards the goal of independent\n   apps/modules in the system (and/or independent blockchain networks).\n * Any attempt o download a new Particl Core binary or start a new binary now\n   occurs after the application has fully started, rather than blocking access\n   to the main application user interface until particl-core has been started.\n * Updated to use Particl Core v23\n\nParticl Core\n * Introduced a new module to allow for the configuration of when and how to\n   start the Particl Core binary/executable.\n * Particl Core will need to be correctly started and accessible in order to\n   access the apps/modules requiring Particl blockchain functionality.\n * Various Particl Core startup configuration options are presented in this\n   module, along with the ability to start or stop a Particl Core node (or\n   connect to an already running node).\n * Note that the settings per chain (mainnet/testnet/regtest) are stored\n   separately, and are updated whenever the chain being connected to is changed\n   (in the Startup menu option).\n * For advanced users, wanting to customize startup further: * the particl-core.json file in the settings directory/folder contains a\n      number of settings per chain (in addition to other settings).\n    * A params key can be placed into the JSON structure of the chain to be\n      configured; this params key should contain a value of an array/list of\n      strings, where each string is the CLI arg of the argument to pass to\n      particl core when starting it. These are not presented in the GUI, but\n      will be applied when attempting to start or connect to the configured\n      Particl chain.\n    * Any incorrect\n      values provided, or an invalid structure, or conflicting params can be\n      viewed in the appropriate log file.\n   \n   \n\nWallet Module\n * Updated after the refactor.\n * Includes minor bug fixes and improvements.\n * Added the ability to export the wallet History to a CSV file.\n * Updated the Settings page: removed the need to click a 'Save' button:\n   settings are now automatically saved once the input loses focus (if the value\n   provided is valid).\n * Added the ability to configure alternative external transaction and address\n   lookup URLs * these are configured according to the Particl chain currently\n      running.\n   \n   \n\nMarketplace dApp\n * Updated after the refactor.\n * Minor fixes and improvements made.\n * Added an indicator to the menu bar to indaicate when the current wallet is\n   locked and order updates may not be processed.\n * Updated the Settings page: removed the need to click a 'Save' button:\n   settings are now automatically saved once the input loses focus (if the value\n   provided is valid).\n * Added the ability to configure alternative external transaction URLs * these\n      are configured according to the Particl chain currently running.\n   \n   \n\nGovernance dApp\n * Updated after the refactor.\n * Minor fixes and improvements made.\n\nDesktop Settings\n * Added the ability to view the Terms and Conditions (not possible previously\n   once they had been accepted after first starting the application).\n * Added the option to toggle whether PD does its own update checks (the URL\n   where updates are queried can be configured in the appropriate settings JSON\n   file: the format of the response needs to be specific, but a script is\n   available to generate and host this file elsewhere if so desired).\n * Included the ability to configure external domains that Particl Desktop can\n   open in the browser. * IMPORTANT! Particl Desktop attempts to prevent unknown external domains\n      from being navigated to, unless they are included in a permitted/allowed\n      list. Some URLs. such as the local machine, the Particl block explorer,\n      and Github, are by default added to this allowed/permitted list. Thus, if\n      any of the transaction or address lookup URLs in the particl wallet or\n      particl market app/modules are changed/customized, ensure that the\n      configured URL (or the domain name at minimum) is also added to this\n      permitted list. Not including the custom domain in the permitted/allowed\n      list will present a prompt indicating that the URL cannot be navigated to.\n   \n   \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith Particl Desktop 3.3 now available on mainnet, we're thrilled to finally\nbegin this new and exciting development cycle poised to significantly improve\nParticl in almost every aspects.\n\nIf you haven't done so already, we, once again, highly recommend reading this\narticle [https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/] which\nextensively details our plans moving forward. \n\nWe are immensely grateful for all the enthusiasm, contributions, and support we\nhave received from the Particl community.

That's because, at the time of its launch, the desktop client lacked the marketplace dApp component and was purely designed as a cryptocurrency wallet. To be more precise, the marketplace itself wasn't initially designed as a standalone dApp, but rather an added set of functionalities to the Particl wallet.</p><p>As the years progressed, Particl's vision developed into a more ambitious goal, necessitating an extensive transformation of the desktop client's unified architecture into a more adaptive and flexible design.</p><p>Particl Desktop 3.3 makes significant strides towards establishing an independent relationship between Particl Core and the desktop client by separating them entirely, allowing them to coexist and operate harmoniously as distinct pieces of software.</p><h2 id=\"first-steps-towards-modularity-\">First Steps Towards Modularity ⚙️</h2><p>The reasoning behind separating Particl Core and Desktop is the first step towards a more modular, open, and developer-friendly ecosystem. It signals the beginning of the client's transformation from a \"cryptocurrency wallet with extra features\" into a fully-fledged sandbox for privacy-first dApps. </p><p>This development is expected to take place through a series of incremental changes all throughout the new development cycle, each update working towards achieving our objective of modularity, openness, and enhanced efficiency.</p><p><strong>To learn more about Particl's new (and now current) development cycle, please refer to <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/\">this extensive blog post</a> on the topic.</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Particl’s Next Evolutionary Leap Forward</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Learn about the team’s new major development cycle and discover Particl’s upcoming open-source foundation for the development and deployment of privacy-first dApps.</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://particl.news/icons/icon-512x512.png\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Particl News</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">cryptoguard</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://particl.news/static/ce0a0b9da50e8a06c5e5f552c168c510/Leap-Forward-Medium.jpg\"></div></a></figure><h2 id=\"general-bug-fixes-and-improvements-\">General Bug Fixes and Improvements ?</h2><p>Aside from this significant leap forward, this new release introduces a wide variety of improvements, both architecturally and to the user experience. It also and a few bugs and issues. You'll find the full changelog at the bottom of this article. </p><h2 id=\"seller-companion-app-is-next-\">Seller Companion App is Next ?</h2><p>Now that Particl Desktop 3.3 is live on mainnet, work on the seller companion app begins. </p><p>For those who may have not seen it yet, here's an excerpt from one of our recent weekly development progress reports which outlines its nature and the planned features for it.</p><blockquote><em>The app will serve as an external inventory and order management system tailored for Particl's \"power sellers\". It will enable sellers to create, manage, and publish listings, but also set up escrow rates, and manage shipping, orders, and chats. We also plan to add plenty of automation into the system — such as the auto-relisting of items, automated pricing updates, and auto-acceptance of orders within specified parameters — to make selling on the marketplace more efficient and effortless.<br><br>The application will also allow sellers to connect their Particl inventory to external platforms, such as WooCommerce, to benefit from its multitude of functionality and flexible plugins. This will drastically reduce the workload of manually maintaining marketplace content, especially when combined with automated processes, and will make it much easier for sellers already selling stuff online to integrate Particl Marketplace as part of the range of platforms they do business on. And of course, we fully expect it to grow the number of listings available on the marketplace!<br><br>The app is set to be rolled out in successive feature updates, a notable step in the direction of making Particl Marketplace more open and accessible, <strong>especially when paired with a web gateway later on during the coming development cycle. </strong><br><br>In reality, it encapsulates the flexibility and cross-platform compatibility of Particl's proposed modular architecture, allowing the marketplace to connect with other platforms and reach broader audiences with greater ease.<br><br>Although this is a small — but important — piece of our marketplace dApp vision, it is a great example of what becomes possible with Particl as we progress through this infrastructural evolutionary phase.<br><br>We aim to make the entire ecosystem more accessible in the near future by integrating new gateways, such as web access, and further developing its components into open modules.

the open source BasicSwap DEX\nprotocol may have noticed some mentions of two different kinds of cross-chain\natomic swaps, namely “adaptor sig” swaps and “secret hash” swaps. \n\nThis article will explore the distinctions between the two kinds of swaps, their\ndifferences, and how the BasicSwap protocol leverages both to offer a truly\ndecentralized and remarkably private basis for decentralized exchanges.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat is an Atomic Swap?\nAn atomic swap, simply speaking, is a type of contract that enables a\ndecentralized cryptocurrency transaction. “Atomic”, in this case, implies that\nthe change of ownership of one asset should effectively imply the change of\nownership of the other. First conceptualized in 2013 by TierNolan on the\nBitcointalk forums\n[https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=193281.msg2003765#msg2003765], this\nfirst iteration of the concept, involving HTLCs (Hashed Time Lock Contracts),\nwould need four more years to finally see the light of day.\n\nAtomic swaps must involve two parties - as such, no third party or outside\nmiddleman can interrupt or interfere with the transaction. This characteristic\nmeans they are decentralized by nature and effectively immune to censorship, and\nas such are used in several decentralized exchanges, such as BasicSwap DEX and\nothers.\n\nIn the BasicSwap application, nearly all of the steps involved in both types of\nswaps happen seamlessly, at the back-end level. Furthermore, the initial\nagreement on the amounts and assets involved in any given swap between two\nparties is handled by its entirely distributed order book, powered by Particl's\nown encrypted mixnet, the SMSG network\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/].\n\nThe Original: Hashed Time Lock Contract (“Secret Hash”) Atomic Swaps\nThe first successful implementation of atomic swaps came from the Decred project\n[https://github.com/decred/atomicswap], leveraging \"hashlocks\" and \"timelocks\",\nwith the help of on-chain scripts (or smart contracts), to accomplish the atomic\nswap conceptualized by TierNolan years earlier. We refer to this type of swap as\na \"secret hash\" swap, or HTLC swap.\n\nTechnically speaking, the HTLC feature allows two users to conduct time-bound\ncryptocurrency transactions. This is highly relevant to this first\nimplementation of atomic swap technology, as the recipient must submit a\ncryptographic proof (the “secret”) to the contract within a set timeframe \n(established in number of blocks, or block height), or else the funds will be\nreturned to the sender. If the recipient acknowledges the payment, the\ntransaction is successful. This, as it happens, requires both participating\nblockchains to have both Hashlock and Timelock capabilities - a condition that\nleaves out certain blockchains, such as the notoriously rigid and hyper-private\nMonero blockchain.\n\nThese two key concepts may be summarized in the following way:\n\nA hashlock is a function of certain blockchains that restricts the spending of\nfunds until a certain piece of data is publicly disclosed (such as a\ncryptographic proof, in the form of a hash\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function]).\n\n\nA timelock is a function that restricts the spending of funds until a specific\ntime (or block height) in the future. This ensures that the transaction occurs\nwithin a given timeframe, and returns funds to the depositor if it is not\ncompleted, without a need for a third party adjudicator.\n\nThe graph below, sourced from Decred's implementation of atomic swaps, provides\na visual representation of the steps and necessary transfers of data that each\nparty performs:\n\n\n\nA HTLC (or \"secret hash\") atomic swap.\n\nIn other words, HTLC-based atomic swaps work as follows: \n\nAlice and Bob must first agree on the amounts and assets (e.g. Bitcoin and\nEther) to exchange. Alice then generates a random secret, s, and uses a\ncryptographic hash function to generate hash, h. She then creates an HTLC\ncontract using h, which locks up the Bitcoin. These coins can either be redeemed\n(spent) using the secret s, or they will be returned to her after a certain\namount of time, t, has passed. Bob does the same thing with his Ether on the\nother chain, locking it up in an HTLC using the same hash, h. Since Alice knows\nthe original secret, s, which was used to produce the hash, h, she can redeem\nthe Ether from Bob's HTLC. By doing so she reveals the secret s to Bob, who can\nthen take the Bitcoin and complete the swap.\n\nWithout diving too deep into the back-end inputs necessary to achieve a\nsuccessful HTLC swap as described in the graph above, the \"secret hash\" involved\nin them is the reason why HTLC swaps are sometimes referred to as \"Secret Hash\nswaps\". For the curious, more extensive documentation on the scripts involved in\nsecret hash swaps is available on the Decred atomic swap github page\n[https://github.com/decred/atomicswap].\n\nSome Shortcomings of Secret Hash Atomic Swaps\nAlthough they are a remarkable breakthrough in the space of decentralized \nexchange technologies, \"secret hash\" atomic swaps are not perfect: these atomic\nswap transactions, and thus, their associated data as well, take place on-chain,\nwhich has privacy implications that are particularly relevant to BasicSwap.\n\nWhenever a swap occurs, an identical hashed value will appear on both\nblockchains within a few blocks of each other — meaning that any moderately\nsophisticated passive observer of the two chains can easily link the coins\ninvolved in the swap, by finding identical hashes in blocks close to each other,\ntimestamp-wise. When the coins are tracked across chains, the provenance is\neasily established. Although there is no associated identity data revealed from\nsuch an analysis, it can potentially be trivial for third-parties to infer the\nidentity of the participants involved.\n\nThe Latest: Adaptor Signature (“Scriptless”) Atomic Swaps\nThe second type of atomic swap available on BasicSwap, dubbed \"adaptor sig\"\nswaps, is based on the work of Monero developer Joël \"h4sh3d\" Gugger, in a Sept.\n2020 paper titled \"Bitcoin–Monero Cross-chain Atomic Swap\"\n[https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126]. H4sh3d’s work can be said to be an\nimplementation of Lloyd Fournier’s work\n[https://github.com/LLFourn/one-time-VES/blob/master/main.pdf] on One-Time\nVerifiably Encrypted Signatures, A.K.A. Adaptor Signatures.\n\nThis type of swap is by necessity fundamentally different from HTLCs, because it\nis impossible for an XMR output to have an associated script. Therefore, a\ndifferent method, which relies in part on necessary prerequisites provided by\nthe non-XMR party, needs to be used to create the lock transaction. Note that\nthese prerequisites are such that the initiating party of the “adaptor sig” swap\nprotocol is only compatible with cryptocurrencies which use a bitcoin-style\ndecentralized UTXO model\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspent_transaction_output], and that have Segwit\nor a Segwit-equivalent malleability fix\n[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_malleability], such as Litecoin.\n\nThose \"scriptless\" swaps rely on a cryptographic technology known as an \"adaptor\nsignature\". In essence, without going too deep into the origins and underlying\nmath behind the technology, an adaptor signature is an additional signature that\nis combined with an initial signature to reveal a secret piece of data. Adaptor\nsignatures enable two parties to reveal two pieces of data to each other\nsimultaneously, and are the key building block of the kind of scriptless\nprotocols that render XMR atomic swap pairs possible.\n\nHow Does It Work?\nThis part of the article is particularly technical, but can shed some light on\nthe privacy distinctions between both swaps.\n\nThe graph below provides a visual representation of the steps and necessary\ntransfers of data that each party performs in an adaptor signature-based swap on\nBSX, from the offerer’s perspective. The green communication layer, in the case\nof BasicSwap, is handled by the SMSG network:\n\nAn \"adaptor sig\" atomic swap, from the Offerer's perspective.In other words,\nadaptor signature-based atomic swaps work as follows:\n\nAlice and Bob must first agree on the amounts and assets (e.g. BTC and XMR) to\nexchange. Just like in the case of “secret hash” swaps, this is achieved in a\nprivate and decentralized way in BasicSwap via its distributed order book.\n\nNote that a property of Monero is that the sum of public keys will match the\npublic key for the sum of private keys. By sending XMR to the sum of the public\nkeys they chose, Alice and Bob can create a lock tx similar to those used in the\nHLTC protocol.\n\nThe basic idea is:\n\nAlice and Bob each pick two secret (ECC) private keys (BTC and XMR), and swap\none set of public keys with each other. Here, three different keys are involved\nfor each side.\n\nAlice sends a BTC transaction with an output to a multisig output, which\nrequires a signature from both Alice and Bob in order to spend it. Once that\noccurs, Bob sees the BTC tx and sends the XMR tx to the XMR public key sum, as\nmentioned above.\n\nAlice signs for her private key and encumbers that signature with Bob's\nxmr_public_key.\n\nShe sends that adaptor signature to Bob. This adaptor signature is not a\ntransaction signature, so the transaction cannot be spent yet, but it does\ncommit to a secret value (Alice’s private key).\n\nBob then decodes the adaptor signature with his xmr_private key and then signs\nfor the BTC lock tx with his btc_private key.\n\nAs Bob now has a valid signature from Alice and himself, he can now spend from\nthe locked BTC tx.\n\nAlice watches the BTC chain for the tx that spends the lock tx. With Bob's\nsignature, which is broadcast publicly on the Bitcoin side once the Bitcoin\nlocked transaction is redeemed, she can recover Bob's xmr_private key.\n\nAlice, now endowed with both her and Bob's xmr_private keys, can spend from the\nXMR lock transaction, concluding the exchange.\n\n“****in’ VOILA” - Dr. Danny Duberstein accomplishing a BTC->XMR adaptor sig\natomic swap for the first time (allegedly)Some Advantages of Adaptor Signature\nSwaps\nAtomic swaps using adaptor signatures have several advantages over traditional\natomic swaps involving HTLCs.\n\nThe first thing to understand is that the adaptor signature swap scheme replaces\nthe on-chain scripts, involving timelocks and hashlocks, on which “secret hash”\nswaps rely on. In other words, the secret and secret-hash in a HTLC swap (as\ndetailed in the first graph) have no immediate parallel in adaptor sig swaps.\nThis particularity of adaptor signature technology is why their implementations\nare sometimes referred to as “scriptless scripts” within the Bitcoin research\ncommunity.\n\nSince no such script is involved, the on-chain footprint is reduced, which has\nthe non-negligible advantage of making the atomic swap more lightweight, and\ntherefore cheaper.\n\nFurthermore, contrary to HTLCs where the same hash has to be used on each chain,\ntransactions involved in an atomic swap using adaptor signatures cannot be\nlinked. This, again, is particularly relevant to BasicSwap’s privacy\nconsiderations [https://particl.news/privacy-and-liquidity-in-basicswap/],\ngranted that at least one of the two coins involved in the cross-chain swaps\nfulfills the prerequisites mentioned in the second paragraph of this article.\n\nThe Path Ahead for BSX: Two-Way Adaptor Signature Setup\nBecause scripts are not possible on blockchains like XMR, there are currently\nconstraints on which coin can initiate a swap on BSX. To trade Monero for\nBitcoin, for example, only the BTC-owning side can *initiate* a transaction. \n\nYet, because advance planning can be done consistent with atomic swapping, it is\nconceptually possible for both sides to effectively originate a swap:\n\nIf I have XMR and want, say, BTC, one could simply post a desire to do a trade \nas their offer. The BTC owner could then initiate the current, more formal\nprocess, still risk free. This process can be automated and be all but invisible\nto the front-end user experience, and is a major and very exciting upcoming item\non the BSX roadmap [https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap].\n\nTo Conclude…\nThe objective of this article is to provide a moderate but somewhat accessible\nunderstanding of why adaptor signature swaps can said to be a more private\nalternative to HTLC swaps, and how it protects swappers from any sort of\nmalicious passive observance by achieving the necessary smart contract logic for\nan atomic swap, without the use of on-chain script or hashed secrets. \n\nAs always, if you care about privacy as we do, we invite you to spread the word\nabout BasicSwap\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-dex/basicswap_explained.html]’s\nongoing open beta.

First conceptualized in 2013 by <a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=193281.msg2003765#msg2003765\">TierNolan on the Bitcointalk forums</a>, this first iteration of the concept, involving HTLCs (Hashed Time Lock Contracts), would need four more years to finally see the light of day.</p><p>Atomic swaps must involve two parties - as such, no third party or outside middleman can interrupt or interfere with the transaction. This characteristic means they are decentralized by nature and effectively immune to censorship, and as such are used in several decentralized exchanges, such as BasicSwap DEX and others.</p><p>In the BasicSwap application, nearly all of the steps involved in both types of swaps happen seamlessly, at the back-end level. Furthermore, the initial agreement on the amounts and assets involved in any given swap between two parties is handled by its entirely distributed order book, powered by Particl's own encrypted mixnet, the <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\">SMSG network</a>.</p><h2 id=\"the-original-hashed-time-lock-contract-secret-hash-atomic-swaps\">The Original: Hashed Time Lock Contract (“Secret Hash”) Atomic Swaps</h2><p>The first successful implementation of atomic swaps came <a href=\"https://github.com/decred/atomicswap\">from the Decred project</a>, leveraging \"hashlocks\" and \"timelocks\", with the help of on-chain scripts (or smart contracts), to accomplish the atomic swap conceptualized by TierNolan years earlier. We refer to this type of swap as a \"secret hash\" swap, or HTLC swap.</p><p>Technically speaking, the HTLC feature allows two users to conduct time-bound cryptocurrency transactions. This is highly relevant to this first implementation of atomic swap technology, as the recipient must submit a cryptographic proof (the “secret”) to the contract <strong>within a set timeframe</strong> (established in number of blocks, or block height), or else the funds will be returned to the sender. If the recipient acknowledges the payment, the transaction is successful. This, as it happens, requires both participating blockchains to have both <strong>Hashlock </strong>and <strong>Timelock </strong>capabilities - a condition that leaves out certain blockchains, such as the notoriously rigid and hyper-private Monero blockchain.</p><p>These two key concepts may be summarized in the following way:</p><p>A <strong>hashlock </strong>is a function of certain blockchains that restricts the spending of funds until a certain piece of data is publicly disclosed (such as a cryptographic proof, in the form of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function\">hash</a>).<br></p><p>A <strong>timelock </strong>is a function that restricts the spending of funds until a specific time (or block height) in the future. This ensures that the transaction occurs within a given timeframe, and returns funds to the depositor if it is not completed, without a need for a third party adjudicator.</p><p>The graph below, sourced from Decred's implementation of atomic swaps, provides a visual representation of the steps and necessary transfers of data that each party performs:</p><p></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/02/b8cfa1a1-d7ea-4f45-b79f-0609cff5889a.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2023/02/b8cfa1a1-d7ea-4f45-b79f-0609cff5889a.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/02/b8cfa1a1-d7ea-4f45-b79f-0609cff5889a.png 739w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>A HTLC (or \"secret hash\") atomic swap.</figcaption></figure><p></p><p>In other words, HTLC-based atomic swaps work as follows: </p><p>Alice and Bob must first agree on the amounts and assets (e.g. Bitcoin and Ether) to exchange. Alice then generates a random secret, s, and uses a cryptographic hash function to generate hash, <em>h</em>. She then creates an HTLC contract using <em>h</em>, which locks up the Bitcoin. These coins can either be redeemed (spent) using the secret <em>s</em>, or they will be returned to her after a certain amount of time, <em>t</em>, has passed. Bob does the same thing with his Ether on the other chain, locking it up in an HTLC using the same hash, <em>h</em>. Since Alice knows the original secret, <em>s</em>, which was used to produce the hash, <em>h</em>, she can redeem the Ether from Bob's HTLC. By doing so she reveals the secret <em>s</em> to Bob, who can then take the Bitcoin and complete the swap.</p><p>Without diving too deep into the back-end inputs necessary to achieve a successful HTLC swap as described in the graph above,<strong> the \"secret hash\" involved in them is the reason why HTLC swaps are sometimes referred to as \"Secret Hash swaps\"</strong>. For the curious, more extensive documentation on the scripts involved in secret hash swaps is available on the <a href=\"https://github.com/decred/atomicswap\">Decred atomic swap github page</a>.</p><h3 id=\"some-shortcomings-of-secret-hash-atomic-swaps\">Some Shortcomings of Secret Hash Atomic Swaps</h3><p>Although they are a remarkable breakthrough in the space of <strong>decentralized</strong> exchange technologies, \"secret hash\" atomic swaps are not perfect: these atomic swap transactions, and thus, their associated data as well, take place <strong>on-chain</strong>, which has privacy implications that are particularly relevant to BasicSwap.</p><p>Whenever a swap occurs, an identical hashed value will appear on both blockchains within a few blocks of each other — meaning that any moderately sophisticated passive observer of the two chains can easily link the coins involved in the swap, by finding identical hashes in blocks close to each other, timestamp-wise. When the coins are tracked across chains, the provenance is easily established. Although there is no associated identity data revealed from such an analysis, <strong>it can potentially be trivial for third-parties to infer the identity of the participants involved</strong>.</p><h2 id=\"the-latest-adaptor-signature-scriptless-atomic-swaps\">The Latest: Adaptor Signature (“Scriptless”) Atomic Swaps</h2><p>The second type of atomic swap available on BasicSwap, dubbed \"adaptor sig\" swaps, is based on the work of Monero developer Joël \"h4sh3d\" Gugger, in a Sept. 2020 paper titled <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126\">\"Bitcoin–Monero Cross-chain Atomic Swap\"</a>. H4sh3d’s work can be said to be an implementation of <a href=\"https://github.com/LLFourn/one-time-VES/blob/master/main.pdf\">Lloyd Fournier’s work</a> on One-Time Verifiably Encrypted Signatures, A.K.A. <strong>Adaptor Signatures</strong>.</p><p>This type of swap is by necessity fundamentally different from HTLCs, because it is impossible for an XMR output to have an associated script. Therefore, a different method, which relies in part on necessary prerequisites provided by the non-XMR party, needs to be used to create the lock transaction. Note that these prerequisites are such that the initiating party of the “adaptor sig” swap protocol is only compatible with cryptocurrencies which use a bitcoin-style decentralized <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspent_transaction_output\">UTXO model</a>, and that have Segwit or a Segwit-equivalent <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_malleability\">malleability fix</a>, such as Litecoin.</p><p>Those \"scriptless\" swaps rely on a cryptographic technology known as an \"adaptor signature\".

By sending XMR to the sum of the public keys they chose, Alice and Bob can create a lock tx similar to those used in the HLTC protocol.</p><p><strong>The basic idea is:</strong></p><p>Alice and Bob each pick <strong>two secret (ECC) private keys</strong> (BTC and XMR), and swap one set of public keys with each other.

In other words, the secret and secret-hash in a HTLC swap (as detailed in the first graph) <strong>have no immediate parallel</strong> in adaptor sig swaps. This particularity of adaptor signature technology is why their implementations are sometimes referred to as “<strong>scriptless scripts</strong>” within the Bitcoin research community.</p><p>Since no such script is involved, the <strong>on-chain footprint is reduced,</strong> which has the non-negligible advantage of making the atomic swap more lightweight, and therefore cheaper.</p><p>Furthermore, contrary to HTLCs where the same hash has to be used on each chain, transactions involved in an atomic swap using adaptor signatures <strong>cannot be linked</strong>. This, again, is particularly relevant to <a href=\"https://particl.news/privacy-and-liquidity-in-basicswap/\">BasicSwap’s privacy considerations</a>, granted that<strong> at least one of the two coins involved in the cross-chain swaps fulfills the prerequisites mentioned in the second paragraph of this article</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"the-path-ahead-for-bsx-two-way-adaptor-signature-setup\">The Path Ahead for BSX: Two-Way Adaptor Signature Setup</h3><p>Because scripts are not possible on blockchains like XMR, there are currently constraints on which coin can initiate a swap on BSX. To trade Monero for Bitcoin, for example, only the BTC-owning side can *initiate* a transaction. </p><p>Yet, because advance planning can be done consistent with atomic swapping, it is conceptually possible for both sides to effectively originate a swap:</p><p>If I have XMR and want, say, BTC, one could simply post <strong>a desire to do a trade</strong> as their offer. The BTC owner could then initiate the current, more formal process, still risk free. This process can be automated and be all but invisible to the front-end user experience, and is a major and very exciting upcoming item on the <a href=\"https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap\">BSX roadmap</a>.</p><h2 id=\"to-conclude-\">To Conclude…</h2><p>The objective of this article is to provide a moderate but somewhat accessible understanding of <strong>why </strong>adaptor signature swaps can said to be a more private alternative to HTLC swaps, and how it protects swappers from any sort of malicious passive observance by achieving the necessary smart contract logic for an atomic swap, without the use of on-chain script or hashed secrets. </p><p>As always, if you care about privacy as we do, we invite you to<a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-dex/basicswap_explained.html\"> spread the word about BasicSwap</a>’s ongoing open beta.

Indeed, we anticipate that\nthe GUI version 2.0 will be completed by next week and will include the\nfollowing improvements:\n\n * Addition of a dark mode.\n * Addition of a new price charting system, including volumes.\n * New, improved user interface codebase.\n * Introduction of a wide variety of GUI improvements, tweaks, and changes based\n   on feedback from our beta testers.\n\n> Note: We're requiring additional time to wrap up the simple mode. For that\nreason, it won't be included in next week's GUI update, but should be ready\nshortly thereafter.\nVideo Tutorials ?️\nWe've started rolling out a series of BasicSwap tutorial videos on Particl's\nYoutube channel. These videos cover the basics of setting up BasicSwap, enabling\ncoins, and more, making the process of using the platform's open beta state much\neasier.\n\nAnd as we release Particl Desktop 3.3 live on mainnet in a few days, which will\nbe followed by an extensive evolutionary process, we'll also be publishing a\nsimilar series of videos highlighting its features and capabilities. \n\nAs we'll have much more content coming to the Particl Youtube channel, make sure\nto subscribe to our Youtube channel [https://www.youtube.com/c/particl] so that\nyou don't miss anything!\n\n * Install BasicSwap on Windows 11 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eEZ-a00uSM]\n * Update BasicSwap [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk3FtE_TKBQ]\n * Update Coins on BasicSwap [https://youtu.be/dURSmAtWE6A]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively targeting transformation into hard money.</strong></p><p>At present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget generated by:</p><ul><li>Network transaction fees</li><li>New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).</li></ul><p>Staking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active circulation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new tokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens minted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases - rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by<br>new token issuance (supply inflation).</p><p>In many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism of asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes that we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token for yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked will either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network grows.</p><p>Staking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not actively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity. Staking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value of circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however paradoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are essentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity that brings intrinsic value<br>to the network.</p><p>So if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed towards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully transform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?</p><p>Simple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the frequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively reducing new token issuance.</p><p>Fortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key applications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:</p><h3 id=\"basicswapdex-bsx-\">BasicSwapDex (BSX)</h3><ul><li>Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​</li><li>​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third party<br>integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap) with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</h3><ul><li>Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds utilised in purchasing goods and services.​</li><li>​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.</li></ul><p><strong>In any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development team and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl network otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time.</strong> They are effectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual supply inflation reward decreases.</p><p>I note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation rate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that result in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft currency.</p><p><strong>It is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus on increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability</strong> to create an L1 system whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to adequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful in that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with additional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money<br>than traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other cryptocurrencies currently traded today.</p><p>Regardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community is active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to further propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to 0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency funded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that satisfies my definition of “hard money”.</p><h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2><ul><li>Voting opens: Est.

Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively targeting transformation into hard money.</strong></p><p>At present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget generated by:</p><ul><li>Network transaction fees</li><li>New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).</li></ul><p>Staking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active circulation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new tokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens minted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases - rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by<br>new token issuance (supply inflation).</p><p>In many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism of asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes that we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token for yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked will either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network grows.</p><p>Staking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not actively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity. Staking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value of circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however paradoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are essentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity that brings intrinsic value<br>to the network.</p><p>So if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed towards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully transform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?</p><p>Simple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the frequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively reducing new token issuance.</p><p>Fortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key applications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:</p><h3 id=\"basicswapdex-bsx-\">BasicSwapDex (BSX)</h3><ul><li>Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​</li><li>​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third party<br>integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap) with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</h3><ul><li>Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds utilised in purchasing goods and services.​</li><li>​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.</li></ul><p><strong>In any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development team and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl network otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time.</strong> They are effectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual supply inflation reward decreases.</p><p>I note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation rate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that result in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft currency.</p><p><strong>It is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus on increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability</strong> to create an L1 system whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to adequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful in that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with additional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money<br>than traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other cryptocurrencies currently traded today.</p><p>Regardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community is active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to further propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to 0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency funded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that satisfies my definition of “hard money”.</p><h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2><ul><li>Voting opens: Est.
