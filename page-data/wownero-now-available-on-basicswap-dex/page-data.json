we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nParticl Marketplace Update ?\nWe've made significant progress on developing the decentralized, LLM-powered\nmoderation tool for the marketplace. Currently, we have two developers assigned\nto the task: one focusing on the LLM component and the other on\nmarketplace-related adjustments.\n\nWe understand that the community has questions about the system's design and\nwhether it will maintain the marketplace's decentralized and private ethos.\nWhile we plan to release an in-depth blog post explaining all details before the\nsystem's launch, we'd like to provide some additional information now.\n\nDecentralized Marketplace Moderation v0.2\nIt's important to understand that the current system will remain in place. Even\nwith upcoming changes, it will still be possible to manually upvote and downvote\nlistings directly in the application.\n\nWhen first released, this system was announced as v0.1, with future iterations\nplanned. Effective moderation of a decentralized system without third-party bias\nis challenging, and what we're working on is essentially v0.2 of that system.\n\nThis new version will use the same downvote/upvote mechanism where listings are\nremoved from the marketplace's interface once they reach a negative threshold,\nbut with more automation, resulting in a much improved user experience.\n\nPro-Active Moderation\nThe updated system will run on staking nodes, and the Partyman cold staking\napplication will likely include a script to guide users through enabling the\nsystem, setting moderation policies and rules, and consulting moderation\nhistory.\n\nWhen enabled, the system will scan the marketplace and extract individual\nlisting titles and descriptions, which will be processed through a decentralized\nLLM network to test against the user's moderation policies.\n\nThis improved version will ensure more effective and proactive marketplace\nmoderation while reducing reliance on manual user interaction.\n\nFrom an end-user perspective, more effective, automated content moderation will\nreduce encounters with undesirable listings before delisting them, benefiting\nmarketplace adoption and directly addressing a theoretical attack vector.\n\nAbsolute Decentralization\nWe've noted concerns about the new system's level of decentralization and\nwhether users will need to create accounts with AI service providers or run\nresource-intensive open-source models locally.\n\nRest assured, our innovative solution requires neither accounts nor local LLM\ninstances. It utilizes a decentralized network of voluntary GPUs collectively\nrunning Llama-based models. Staking nodes will simply send messages to this\ndecentralized LLM network and receive appropriate responses, which will then be\nprocessed by the rest of the moderation system.\n\nIn other words, decentralization and privacy remain intact, with no compromises\ncaused by the new changes.\n\nUpvoting and Downvoting\nOnce a response is received from the LLM network, the node will use the\nassociated wallet's staking weight to upvote, downvote, or ignore the listing.\nThe marketplace will tally votes for each listing, and if the negative threshold\nis reached, it will be removed, as per the current system.\n\nListings can also be upvoted to counterbalance downvotes, and the delisting\nthreshold will be adjusted to account for the expected increased participation\nrate.\n\nUpcoming Blog Post\nWe'll publish a detailed blog post shortly before releasing this new version of\nthe moderation system, including diagrams, in-depth information, and usage\nguides.\n\nWe're confident this new system will improve the user experience by reducing the\nmoderation burden on end users while also improving efficiency.\n\nDisabling of Public Markets and Storefronts\nWe've also noticed concerns regarding a specific commit made in June to Particl\nMarketplace that would disable public markets and storefronts.\n\nThis commit was initially pushed as a proactive measure to prevent potential\nabuse of Particl Marketplace in case we couldn't rapidly improve the moderation\nsystem.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this commit has not yet been included in\nany release and, given our satisfactory progress on the new version of the\nmoderation system, it now appears that implementing it will not be necessary.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nUser Interface  ?️\nSimilarly to last week, we've been working on several minor fixes and\nimprovements to the user interface. These updates will soon be available on\nGitHub and, as always, you'll be able to test these changes before they go live\nby switching to the dev branch.\n\nWindows Setup Wizard v3 ?‍♂️\nWe've devoted some of our time to work on changes for the upcoming v3 version of\nthe BasicSwap Windows installer. These updates are designed to resolve the\nmajority of lingering issues, notably around permissions, and streamline the\nprocesses of upgrading, adding or removing coins.\n\nDr. Kap and BasicSwap Presenting at the Litecoin Summit ?️\nLitecoin Summit 2024 NashvilleLitecoin Foundation proudly presents the 4th\nannual Litecoin Summit at Margaritaville Hotel Nashville!

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult.

In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from 6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will increase from 3% to 3.5<strong>%</strong> for the next year.
