The Particl discussion forum is now\nlive and ready to use! This new platform will allow the entire community as well\nas Particl team members to communicate in a new, more organized way than on a\nchat platform. It has already been populated with content such as articles,\ntutorials, posts, news, archived discussions, and more to help kickstart it.\nWithout further ado, let’s dive right in into what this platform is going to\nbring to the Particl community!\n\nFORUM LINK: https://particl.community\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore Details\nDiscourse\nOur new discussion forum [https://particl.community] is based on Discourse\n[http://discourse.com], a slick-looking and high-performance forum platform\ndesigned for the modern-day internet. In fact, Discourse is a very smooth\nplatform which will make the Particl forum experience as smooth as silk as well\nas enable a wide variety of engaging features that will surely come in handy in\nvarious situations. Here are some of the highlights from our own Discourse\nsetup:\n\nStructured Discussions\nThis new forum will help better structure all the discussions going around the\ncommunity. As it stood up until now, the great majority of discussions within\nthe community happened over one of our instant messaging platforms such as\nTelegram or Discord. While this does provide a dynamic way of discussing with\nyour peers in real-time, it fails to make these discussions accessible.\n\nParticl Forum’s HomepageIn fact, there is only a small number of Telegram and\nDiscord channels, most of which are being underused because of the separation\nthey create with the rest of the community which mostly hangs on #general.\nMoreover, discussions quickly get buried under days and weeks of chatter and, at\nsome point, disappear whenever they get too old. This is obviously not an ideal\nset up, especially when it comes to help & support; different users will often\nbe asking the same questions because they cannot be expected to scroll weeks of\nchatter to see if their question has already been answered.\n\nLet’s also not forget that our community is still relatively small compared to\nits full potential when the marketplace will be on mainnet. In fact, some of the\nbigger cryptocurrency communities hosted on Telegram are quite chaotic due to\nthe very nature of instant messaging platforms, so it only makes sense to\nprepare our infrastructure for when we get a good influx of new users.\nFurthermore, as the “forum format” is very popular on the internet and used by\nmillions of people every day, and as we may very well get users that are not\ncryptocurrency users or simply not used to hang in instant messaging platforms,\nhaving a more intuitive and easy-to-navigate platform will surely be something\nthat will make life easier for a lot of people.\n\nCentral Point of Information\nParticl is all about decentralization, but that doesn’t mean the information\nsurrounding the project has to be all over the place. While the Particl Wiki\nalready does more or less of a good job to keep the information about Particl\norganized, we believe the forum will also help a lot. For example, any support\nrequired by a user and later marked as solved will be easy to dig back out and\nlink back to any other user having similar issues.\n\nAny article, video, news, and similar posts will be very easy to find for users,\nand this “everything-under-the-same-hood” approach will definitely help\nnewcomers quickly find the information they are looking for. This is but one\nmore step towards making Particl information more accessible to as many people\nas possible!\n\nHelp & Support\nAmong the many categories that are initially included with the Particl forum is\na Help & Support category. We strongly believe this category to be an absolute\nrequirement for the improvement of user support as well as to make it much\neasier for anyone to find the information they need without having to scroll\nweeks of unrelated discussions on Telegram or Discord. As such, we have ported\nour Particl Wiki [http://particl.wiki]’s FAQ into a pinned thread\n[https://particl.community/t/frequently-asked-questions-faq/43/2] so that users\ncould easily answer the most frequently asked questions by themselves or ask\ntheir questions, if they are not already included, as a reply to the FAQ thread\nso that it could be added to it upon resolving.\n\nMoreover, the forum format is used around the world and is a very popular and\ninstinctive platform to grow communities on. We believe that, as we release the\nmainnet version of Particl Marketplace and attract vendors and buyers, it will\nbecome a very valuable platform to help and support these users which may\nactually not be used to, or tempted to use, chat platforms such as Telegram or\nDiscord.\n\nArchived Discussions\nArchived discussions are discussions of interest that happen outside the Particl\nforum but are archived on it. The reason these discussions are getting archived\non the Particl Forum [https://particl.community/tags/archive] is that they are\nthought of as constructive, interesting, and in general, adding value to the\nbroader Particl discussion.\n\nAs mentioned throughout this post, many of the platforms we are on (i.e.\nTelegram, Discord, etc) are not ideal when it comes to preserving discussions\nand making them easily accessible. Particl Forum, on the other hand, offers a\nmuch more structured way of preserving and categorizing discussions or thoughts,\nhence why we believe noteworthy discussions should be made easily available for\nall to see, even if it has been weeks or months since they happened.\n\nNote: There is no “Archives” category. We prefer putting every archived\ndiscussion within the category it fits in to make them easier to find. You can,\nhowever, simply select the archive [https://particl.community/tags/archive] tag\nto filter all the forum posts and only display archived posts. To do so, go to\nthe main page of the forum and select archive\n[https://particl.community/tags/archive] as the tag filter.\n\nFor more information about archived discussions, visit this thread: \nhttps://particl.community/t/what-are-archived-discussions/79\n\nFor a good example of an archived discussions, read What is Dandelion?\n[https://particl.community/t/what-is-dandelion/78]\n\nSelf-Governance\nAn interesting feature of the Discourse platform is that it allows, not too\nunlike Particl Marketplace, the community to govern itself. In fact, Discourse\nincludes a trust system as well as a flagging/report system that can hide\ninappropriate posts once they reach a certain threshold calculated by crunching\ntogether trust levels and numbers of flags. Users that reach trust level 4, the\nhighest trust level, are even granted limited moderating powers which allow them\nto keep the environment clean when no moderators are around. After all, users\ntrust level 4 are those trusted ones that have been hanging around the forum for\nthe most time and have made quality contributions to it.\n\nTo learn more about Discourse’s self-governance mechanism, read this article\nposted on the official Discourse blog: \nhttps://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/\n\nParticl Proposal Discussions\nAs many of you already know, our development team has been working on the \nProject Governance mechanism that will allow any Particl users to create,\nsubmit, and vote on proposals directly within the Particl Desktop wallet\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6].\nParticl Desktop does not, however, support proposal discussions. These proposal\ndiscussions and debates are expected to be vital to the voting and consensus\nreaching process and would benefit a lot from a more organized way to go about\nthem.\n\nThe Particl forum contains a Proposals\n[https://particl.community/c/general-discussion/proposals] sub-category within\nthe General [https://particl.community/c/general-discussion] category. Because\nParticl Desktop allows users to link to an external discussion thread, it is\nrecommended that users first submit their proposal on the forum and then submit\nit to the network (with the link to the discussion thread included in the\nsubmission). This will help people easily find the thread dedicated to a\nspecific proposal and discuss what’s being proposed in a well-structured fashion\nand for all voters to see.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFun Social Features\nNot only is Discourse full of useful features, but it’s also full of fun and\nsocial features! In fact, we’ve added a lot of plugins to the vanilla version of\nDiscourse, including a custom-theme, that makes hanging on the Particl forum a\nreal treat.\n\nUser Cards\nCryptoguard’s User CardUser cards are a small profile summary attached to every\nuser that can be displayed simply by clicking on the user’s avatar. They display\na lot of useful information about the user in question such as social media\nplatform usernames, forum statistics, title, and badges. They allow users to\nquickly preview another user’s profile without requiring to quit the page or\nthread they’re currently on. This is an excellent way to display your forum\nachievements and activity to the rest of the community as well as making\nyourself easier to reach out to on any platform you’re on!\n\nBadges\nA few examples of custom badges made for the Particl forumBadges are forum\n“achievements” you acquire throughout your journey on the Particl forum and are\nmeant to showcase to the rest of the community your involvement within the\nproject. On top of the default badges included in the vanilla version of\nDiscourse, we’ve added a few of them (such as Wiki Contributor, Alpha Tester, \nBug Finder, Coin Swapper, and etc) to highlight some of our own milestones and\ncommunity achievements. They are an excellent way to build a reputation for\nyourself and showcase your support and involvement in the project! For a list of\nthe currently available badges, visit the forum’s badges page\n[https://particl.community/badges]. Note that more badges will be added as we\nmove forward and receive suggestions from the community.\n\nReactions\nYou can react to posts and threads the same way you can do it on Discord or\nSlack. Indeed, on top of the “like” function that comes with the default version\nof Discourse, we’ve added a plugin which allows users to “react” on posts using\nany emojis. Don’t be afraid to show how you feel about a certain post! ?\n\nPolls\nExample of a poll within a threadPolls are going to be useful for anyone that\nwants to poll the community about a certain issue, matter, or question. Up until\nnow, polls were exclusively held on either Twitter or Discord (using “reacts”),\na set up that wasn’t optimal. In fact, if you didn’t have a Twitter account, you\ncouldn’t vote on Twitter polls. If the poll was held instead on Discord, it was\ngetting buried by the constant chatter within only a few hours. Discord polls\nalso do not allow for very complex sets of options.\n\nWith the Particl forum’s polling feature, polls can now be properly referenced\nby a link and are opened to every member of the community. Yes, you will need a\nforum account to participate, but it is, in the end, a much more private\nsolution (don’t need to provide a phone number, unlike Twitter), convenient\n(doesn’t get buried, can be easily linked to and shared), and flexible (can put\nmany options and include much more details) way to do it.\n\nSwap Angels\nBack when the community decided to go ahead with the Community Initiative to\naccommodate late swappers\n[https://particl.news/a-community-driven-initiative-e26724100c3a], it was\ndiscussed within the community that the people who would donate may, possibly,\nreceive some kind of flair or special mention as a token of appreciation. As we\nslowly, but surely, head towards the mainnet release of the long-awaited Particl\nMarketplace, we believe that now would be a great time to celebrate our generous\nveteran holders who have donated some of their personal funds to help and rescue\nlate swappers.\n\nAs of today, donors to the initiative will be able to display a special badge, \nflair, title or any combination of those on their profile and user card. These\noptional options can be granted to donors’ Particl forum accounts simply by\nsending a message containing your Particl Portal username as well as whether you\nwould like to be displayed on the Hall of Fame thread or not to Cryptoguard\n[https://particl.community/u/cryptoguard/summary].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional Resources\nTutorial\nIf you would like to follow an interactive tutorial that will show you the basic\nfunctions of Discourse, simply read the message from @discobot that you will\nautomatically receive in your inbox upon signing up and follow through his\ninstructions.

The Particl discussion forum is now live and ready to use! This new platform will allow the entire community as well as Particl team members to communicate in a new, more organized way than on a chat platform.

Without further ado, let’s dive right in into what this platform is going to bring to the Particl community!</p><p><strong>FORUM LINK: </strong><a href=\"https://particl.community\"><strong>https://particl.community</strong></a></p><hr><h2 id=\"more-details\">More Details</h2><h3 id=\"discourse\">Discourse</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Particl-Forum-is-Now-Live-/1-lCk_rFM_3CbbdQBes3DdXg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p><a href=\"https://particl.community\">Our new discussion forum</a> is based on <a href=\"http://discourse.com\">Discourse</a>, a slick-looking and high-performance forum platform designed for the modern-day internet. In fact, Discourse is a very smooth platform which will make the Particl forum experience as smooth as silk as well as enable a wide variety of engaging features that will surely come in handy in various situations. Here are some of the highlights from our own Discourse setup:</p><h3 id=\"structured-discussions\"><strong>Structured Discussions</strong></h3><p>This new forum will help better structure all the discussions going around the community. As it stood up until now, the great majority of discussions within the community happened over one of our instant messaging platforms such as Telegram or Discord. While this does provide a dynamic way of discussing with your peers in real-time, it fails to make these discussions accessible.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Particl-Forum-is-Now-Live-/1-yaWqiLCzUjOfiIEUk0pU0w.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl Forum’s Homepage</figcaption></figure><p>In fact, there is only a small number of Telegram and Discord channels, most of which are being underused because of the separation they create with the rest of the community which mostly hangs on #general. Moreover, discussions quickly get buried under days and weeks of chatter and, at some point, disappear whenever they get too old. This is obviously not an ideal set up, especially when it comes to help &amp; support; different users will often be asking the same questions because they cannot be expected to scroll weeks of chatter to see if their question has already been answered.</p><p>Let’s also not forget that our community is still relatively small compared to its full potential when the marketplace will be on mainnet. In fact, some of the bigger cryptocurrency communities hosted on Telegram are quite chaotic due to the very nature of instant messaging platforms, so it only makes sense to prepare our infrastructure for when we get a good influx of new users. Furthermore, as the “forum format” is very popular on the internet and used by millions of people every day, and as we may very well get users that are not cryptocurrency users or simply not used to hang in instant messaging platforms, having a more intuitive and easy-to-navigate platform will surely be something that will make life easier for a lot of people.</p><h3 id=\"central-point-of-information\">Central Point of Information</h3><p>Particl is all about decentralization, but that doesn’t mean the information surrounding the project has to be all over the place. While the Particl Wiki already does more or less of a good job to keep the information about Particl organized, we believe the forum will also help a lot. For example, any support required by a user and later marked as <strong>solved</strong> will be easy to dig back out and link back to any other user having similar issues.</p><p>Any article, video, news, and similar posts will be very easy to find for users, and this “everything-under-the-same-hood” approach will definitely help newcomers quickly find the information they are looking for.

We strongly believe this category to be an absolute requirement for the improvement of user support as well as to make it much easier for anyone to find the information they need without having to scroll weeks of unrelated discussions on Telegram or Discord. As such, we have ported our <a href=\"http://particl.wiki\">Particl Wiki</a>’s FAQ into a <a href=\"https://particl.community/t/frequently-asked-questions-faq/43/2\"><strong>pinned thread</strong></a> so that users could easily answer the most frequently asked questions by themselves or ask their questions, if they are not already included, as a reply to the FAQ thread so that it could be added to it upon resolving.</p><p>Moreover, the forum format is used around the world and is a very popular and instinctive platform to grow communities on. We believe that, as we release the mainnet version of Particl Marketplace and attract vendors and buyers, it will become a very valuable platform to help and support these users which may actually not be used to, or tempted to use, chat platforms such as Telegram or Discord.</p><h3 id=\"archived-discussions\">Archived Discussions</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Particl-Forum-is-Now-Live-/1-C2U3BiLI1zUUQ-TuNdZkRw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Archived discussions are discussions of interest that happen outside the Particl forum but are archived on it.

In fact, Discourse includes a trust system as well as a flagging/report system that can hide inappropriate posts once they reach a certain threshold calculated by crunching together trust levels and numbers of flags. Users that reach trust level 4, the highest trust level, are even granted limited moderating powers which allow them to keep the environment clean when no moderators are around. After all, users trust level 4 are those trusted ones that have been hanging around the forum for the most time and have made quality contributions to it.</p><p>To learn more about Discourse’s self-governance mechanism, read this article posted on the official Discourse blog: <a href=\"https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/\">https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/</a></p><h3 id=\"particl-proposal-discussions\">Particl Proposal Discussions</h3><p>As many of you already know, our development team has been working on the <a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\">Project Governance mechanism that will allow any Particl users to create, submit, and vote on proposals directly within the Particl Desktop wallet</a>.

Because Particl Desktop allows users to link to an external discussion thread, it is recommended that users first submit their proposal on the forum and then submit it to the network (with the link to the discussion thread included in the submission).

Up until now, polls were exclusively held on either Twitter or Discord (using “reacts”), a set up that wasn’t optimal. In fact, if you didn’t have a Twitter account, you couldn’t vote on Twitter polls. If the poll was held instead on Discord, it was getting buried by the constant chatter within only a few hours. Discord polls also do not allow for very complex sets of options.</p><p>With the Particl forum’s polling feature, polls can now be properly referenced by a link and are opened to every member of the community. Yes, you will need a forum account to participate, but it is, in the end, a much more private solution (don’t need to provide a phone number, unlike Twitter), convenient (doesn’t get buried, can be easily linked to and shared), and flexible (can put many options and include much more details) way to do it.</p><h3 id=\"swap-angels\">Swap Angels</h3><p>Back when the community <a href=\"https://particl.news/a-community-driven-initiative-e26724100c3a\">decided to go ahead with the Community Initiative to accommodate late swappers</a>, it was discussed within the community that the people who would donate may, possibly, receive some kind of flair or special mention as a token of appreciation.

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est. July, 2025\n * Implementation: Upon successful vote (75% approval rate with minimum quorum\n   of 20% of the total supply over 10,080 blocks) and subsequent hard fork.\n\nImpact\nIf approved, this change will:\n\n * Significantly reduce PART's inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%;\n * Reduce PART’s inflation rate by 0.5% every year until it reaches 1.0%;\n * Remove the network treasury;\n * Initiate a hard fork of the Particl blockchain.\n\nWe believe this proposal represents a positive step toward optimizing the\nParticl network's economic model while ensuring sustainable project development\nand incentivising our community to actively promote and grow the\nnetwork.Important: For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are\nrunning its latest version.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity.
