These are the output claim management proposal and the one to enable\na brand new, powerful treasury model.\n\nThat’s directly in line with our recent efforts to put more focus on community\ngovernance and improve the degree of decentralization of the project. This now\nputs you in a much more influential position.\n\nToday, we are thrilled to reveal all the details and parameters of this on-chain\nand entirely decentralized voting mechanism.\n\nLet’s jump right in!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Contents\n * CCS Proposals\n * On-Chain Voting\n * Approval Rates, Quorum, Duration, and Consensus\n   [/on-chain-voting-and-ccs-proposals/approval-rates-quorum-duration-and-consensus]\n * Potential Voting Outcomes\n * Proposal Lifecycle\n * Community Fund\n * First Proposal Coming in on Wednesday\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCCS Proposals\nAs explained, in detail, in the introductory blog post of the CCS\n[https://particl.news/new-community-crowdfunding-system-f31f54231982/], anyone\ncan submit proposals on the CCS to request donations for initiatives from the\ncommunity. The introduction of the CCS was the first step in improving the level\nof decentralization and put in place a solid governance mechanism. The on-chain\nvoting system, which is now integrated into the CCS, is the next step to that\nmission.\n\nOn-Chain Voting\nThe on-chain network voting system is an additional governance tool that you can\nnow use to let your voice be heard. Any CCS proposal can now request a network\nvote to determine consensus. The most common use for network votes will be for\nproposals requesting initiatives to be funded from the Community Fund, but can\nbe used for other purposes as well. That's all up to the proposal owner!\n\nThe voting system works using staking weight, meaning that you register a vote\nevery time you stake a block on the network. This ensures that only those with a\nstake or interest in the project can vote, preventing outside influence from\naffecting the votes unjustly. It also encourages more people to stake their\ncoins to vote, which increases the network’s security and performance at the\nsame time.\n\nThe main benefit of on-chain voting compared to the legacy, SMSG-based voting\nsystem that was present in Particl Desktop is auditability and provability. With\nthis system, all votes, and their tallied results, are permanently written on\nthe blockchain, and results can provably be observed at any later time without\nany risk of tampering.\n\nIt's important to mention that staking pools, whose staking weight is made up of\nall the coins staked on the pool, also possess the power to vote. The more coins\na pool contains, the more voting power it has.\n\n> Note: For a vote to be counted, you need to successfully stake a block within\nthe voting period. If you own a small balance of PART (< 1,000 PART), it is\nlikely that you don’t stake a block every week and thus, won’t register a vote.\nApproval Rates, Quorum, Duration, and Consensus\n\nFor a proposal’s voting process to be considered valid, there are three\nrequirements to fill. They are the quorum requirement, the approval rate, and\nthe minimum duration of the voting process. The quorum requirement is determined\nby what percentage of the blocks within a given voting process cast a vote. The\napproval rate is defined by the percentage of the votes cast being in favor of a\nproposal.\n\nProposals that require a vote are separated into two different categories, each\none with its own value requirements.\n\nNon Protocol Consensus Votes\n * Quorum: 20% of blocks during the voting period\n * Approval rate: >= 60% in favor\n * Duration: 5,040 blocks minimum\n\nNon protocol consensus votes are proposals that do not require a major change in\nthe protocol to be made. Typically, they would be proposals claiming funds from\nthe Community Fund, for example, or determining the direction of a particular\ninitiative.\n\nFor a non protocol consensus vote to be considered valid, its voting period must\nbe a minimum of 5,040 blocks (roughly one week). Within that period, 20% of the\nblocks staked need to cast a vote for one of the available voting options. That\nmeans the quorum has to be at least 20%. Finally, to be considered as approved\nby the community, it needs to reach an approval rate of at least 60%, meaning at\nleast 60% of all the votes cast for the proposal are in favor of the proposed\nidea.\n\nProtocol Consensus Votes\n * Quorum: 20% of blocks during the voting period\n * Approval rate: >= 75% in favor\n * Duration: 10,080 blocks minimum\n\nProtocol consensus votes are a bit more important in scope and can have a more\nsignificant impact on the ecosystem. They are any proposal that requires a\nspecific change in the protocol, such as, for example, integrating a\ndecentralized treasury model, modifying the inflation rate of the blockchain,\nintroducing a new privacy technology, etc.\n\nJust like non protocol consensus votes, their quorum requirement stands at 20%.\nBut because of their increased level of importance and ramifications, they\nrequire a higher level of approval from the community. In fact, the required \napproval rate has to be at least 75%. Finally, the duration of any protocol\nconsensus vote has to be a minimum of 10,080 blocks (roughly two weeks) to give\nample time to anyone to be able to cast their vote.\n\nPotential Voting Outcomes\nThere are a few possible scenarios to a vote. Here they are with their\nrespective outcome.\n\n * If quorum is not met, the proposal is REJECTED ❌\n * If the quorum is met but the votes fail to meet the target approval rate, the\n   proposal is REJECTED ❌\n * If the quorum is met and the votes reach the approval rate (“Yes”), the\n   proposal is APPROVED ✅\n * If a voting round reaches its expiration before reaching quorum or the target\n   approval rate, the proposal expires and is REJECTED ❌\n\nProposal Lifecycle\nBelow is the basic process for submitting and evaluating proposals that require\na vote.\n\n * A proposal is submitted on the CCS. Click here\n   [https://ccs.particl.io/how-to-ccs/] to see how to submit your own proposal.\n * The proposal owner indicates, in the header, whether the proposal requires a\n   vote or not.\n * The proposal is reviewed by the CCS administrators and then published.\n * Valid proposals are open for discussion for a minimum of one week but voting\n   does not begin immediately. The proposal can be edited by its owner in\n   response to community feedback.\n * If a proposal becomes clearly inactive (proposal owner stops commenting on\n   the proposal or does not authorize the start of voting), a CCS administrator\n   may mark the proposal as “Abandoned”. Abandoned proposals are publicly\n   viewable, but cannot be edited, commented on, or be authorized to vote. A CCS\n   administrator can mark a proposal as abandoned at any time before the\n   proposal owner authorizes voting. Once the proposal owner authorizes voting\n   on a proposal, it cannot be abandoned unless the proposal owner revokes\n   voting on the proposal.\n * The proposal owner authorizes voting to start. A CCS administrator will then\n   assign a voting block interval to it (duration of the voting period).\n * The voting period begins for the number of blocks assigned by the\n   administrator. For example, one week is around 5,040 blocks.\n * When the voting period ends, the proposal is formally approved or rejected.\n   This depends on if the quorum and the approval rate are met.\n * When a proposal with a budget and deliverables is approved, work can begin.\n   The proposal owner can submit claims for funds upon completion of the\n   milestone deliverables that are pre-defined within the proposal.\n\nCommunity Fund\nInsightParticl Insight. View detailed information on all particl transactions\nand blocks.\n[https://explorer.particl.io/address/RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM]If you\nhave a great project or business you wish to build on Particl, or if there’s a\nservice you want to provide to the ecosystem, you may require funds to make it\nhappen. Ever since the initial release of the CCS, the only way to get that\nfunding was through community donations.\n\nWith the on-chain voting system, you will soon be able to claim funds from the \nCommunity Fund\n[https://explorer.particl.io/address/RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM] to help\nyou realize your initiative. And because this Community Fund belongs to all PART\nholders, it needs their approval to draw funds from it.\n\nIndeed, to incentivize more use of the CCS system by the community, the team is\ngoing to open up the Community Fund. All you’ll need to do to claim the funds is\ncraft a clear proposal that requires a vote and explains your initiative in\ndetail as well as why you need the funds. Then, you need to convince the Particl\ncommunity to vote in favor of your proposal and approve the claim of funds.\n\nFirst Proposal Coming in on Wednesday!\nYou won’t have to wait for too long to put on your first vote! As soon as this \nWednesday (28th of April, 2021), we will publish the first-ever proposal to\nrequire the use of the on-chain voting system.\n\nThis proposal, which was widely requested by the community, seeks to nominate\nthe Particl team as managers of the manual claim process required to unfreeze\nall legitimate anon and blind coins. These coins are currently frozen as part of\nthe emergency hardfork deployed by the team weeks ago and they need to be\nre-enabled as smoothly as possible. Keep an eye out on Particl News and the CCS\non Wednesday for all the details on the proposal!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith the support of the on-chain voting system as well as the upcoming few\nproposals, the Particl project is entering a brand new phase that emphasizes the\npower of the community much more. If you’ve ever had a great idea for a project,\nbusiness, or service you think would benefit the Particl ecosystem, you’ll have\nall the tools you need to make it happen, if you can convince the community!\n\nThis addition to the CCS marks a significant milestone for the project and\nshould lead to many more community contributions than we’ve ever seen. Don’t\nforget, if the decentralized treasury model proposal is approved, the Community\nFund is also going to grow in value and, if the price of PART increases, will\ngrow exponentially in value, opening even more doors. This has tremendous\npotential and we can’t wait to see what you, the community, will create with\nthese resources!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

The introduction of the CCS was the first step in improving the level of decentralization and put in place a solid governance mechanism. The on-chain voting system, which is now integrated into the CCS, is the next step to that mission.</p><h1 id=\"on-chain-voting\">On-Chain Voting</h1><p>The on-chain network voting system is an additional governance tool that you can now use to let your voice be heard. Any CCS proposal can now request a network vote to determine consensus. The most common use for network votes will be for proposals requesting initiatives to be funded from the Community Fund, but can be used for other purposes as well. That's all up to the proposal owner!</p><p>The voting system works using staking weight, meaning that you register a vote every time you stake a block on the network. This ensures that only those with a stake or interest in the project can vote, preventing outside influence from affecting the votes unjustly. It also encourages more people to stake their coins to vote, which increases the network’s security and performance at the same time.</p><p>The main benefit of on-chain voting compared to the legacy, SMSG-based voting system that was present in Particl Desktop is auditability and provability. With this system, all votes, and their tallied results, are permanently written on the blockchain, and results can provably be observed at any later time without any risk of tampering.</p><p>It's important to mention that staking pools, whose staking weight is made up of all the coins staked on the pool, also possess the power to vote. The more coins a pool contains, the more voting power it has.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> For a vote to be counted, you need to successfully stake a block within the voting period. If you own a small balance of PART (&#x3C; 1,000 PART), it is likely that you don’t stake a block every week and thus, won’t register a vote.</em></blockquote><h1 id=\"approval-rates-quorum-duration-and-consensus\">Approval Rates, Quorum, Duration, and Consensus</h1><p><br>For a proposal’s voting process to be considered valid, there are three requirements to fill. They are the <strong>quorum requirement</strong>, the <strong>approval rate</strong>, and the <strong>minimum duration of the voting process</strong>. The quorum requirement is determined by what percentage of the blocks within a given voting process cast a vote. The approval rate is defined by the percentage of the votes cast being in favor of a proposal.</p><p>Proposals that require a vote are separated into two different categories, each one with its own value requirements.</p><h3 id=\"non-protocol-consensus-votes\">Non Protocol Consensus Votes</h3><ul><li><strong>Quorum:</strong> 20% of blocks during the voting period</li><li><strong>Approval rate:</strong> >= 60% in favor</li><li><strong>Duration:</strong> 5,040 blocks minimum</li></ul><p>Non protocol consensus votes are proposals that do not require a major change in the protocol to be made. Typically, they would be proposals claiming funds from the Community Fund, for example, or determining the direction of a particular initiative.</p><p>For a non protocol consensus vote to be considered valid, its voting period must be a <strong>minimum of 5,040 blocks (roughly one week). </strong>Within that period, 20% of the blocks staked need to cast a vote for one of the available voting options. That means <strong>the quorum has to be at least 20%</strong>. Finally, to be considered as approved by the community, it needs to reach an <strong>approval rate of at least 60%</strong>, meaning at least 60% of all the votes cast for the proposal are in favor of the proposed idea.</p><h3 id=\"protocol-consensus-votes\">Protocol Consensus Votes</h3><ul><li><strong>Quorum:</strong> 20% of blocks during the voting period</li><li><strong>Approval rate:</strong> >= 75% in favor</li><li><strong>Duration:</strong> 10,080 blocks minimum</li></ul><p>Protocol consensus votes are a bit more important in scope and can have a more significant impact on the ecosystem. They are any proposal that requires a specific change in the protocol, such as, for example, integrating a decentralized treasury model, modifying the inflation rate of the blockchain, introducing a new privacy technology, etc.</p><p>Just like non protocol consensus votes, their <strong>quorum requirement stands at 20%</strong>. But because of their increased level of importance and ramifications, they require a higher level of approval from the community. In fact, the required <strong>approval rate has to be at least 75%</strong>. Finally, the duration of any protocol consensus vote has to be a <strong>minimum of 10,080 blocks (roughly two weeks)</strong> to give ample time to anyone to be able to cast their vote.</p><h1 id=\"potential-voting-outcomes\">Potential Voting Outcomes</h1><p>There are a few possible scenarios to a vote. Here they are with their respective outcome.</p><ul><li>If quorum is not met, the proposal is <strong>REJECTED </strong>❌</li><li>If the quorum is met but the votes fail to meet the target approval rate, the proposal is <strong>REJECTED </strong>❌</li><li>If the quorum is met and the votes reach the approval rate (“Yes”), the proposal is <strong>APPROVED </strong>✅</li><li>If a voting round reaches its expiration before reaching quorum or the target approval rate, the proposal expires and is <strong>REJECTED </strong>❌</li></ul><h1 id=\"proposal-lifecycle\">Proposal Lifecycle</h1><p>Below is the basic process for submitting and evaluating proposals that require a vote.</p><ul><li>A proposal is submitted on the CCS. <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io/how-to-ccs/\"><strong>Click here</strong></a> to see how to submit your own proposal.</li><li>The proposal owner indicates, in the header, whether the proposal requires a vote or not.</li><li>The proposal is reviewed by the CCS administrators and then published.</li><li>Valid proposals are open for discussion for a minimum of one week but voting does not begin immediately. The proposal can be edited by its owner in response to community feedback.</li><li>If a proposal becomes clearly inactive (proposal owner stops commenting on the proposal or does not authorize the start of voting), a CCS administrator may mark the proposal as “Abandoned”. Abandoned proposals are publicly viewable, but cannot be edited, commented on, or be authorized to vote. A CCS administrator can mark a proposal as abandoned at any time before the proposal owner authorizes voting. Once the proposal owner authorizes voting on a proposal, it cannot be abandoned unless the proposal owner revokes voting on the proposal.</li><li>The proposal owner authorizes voting to start. A CCS administrator will then assign a voting block interval to it (duration of the voting period).</li><li>The voting period begins for the number of blocks assigned by the administrator. For example, one week is around 5,040 blocks.</li><li>When the voting period ends, the proposal is formally approved or rejected. This depends on if the quorum and the approval rate are met.</li><li>When a proposal with a budget and deliverables is approved, work can begin. The proposal owner can submit claims for funds upon completion of the milestone deliverables that are pre-defined within the proposal.</li></ul><h2 id=\"community-fund\">Community Fund</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://explorer.particl.io/address/RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Insight</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Particl Insight.

Ever since the initial release of the CCS, the only way to get that funding was through community donations.</p><p>With the on-chain voting system, you will soon be able to claim funds from the <strong><a href=\"https://explorer.particl.io/address/RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM\">Community Fund</a></strong> to help you realize your initiative. And because this Community Fund belongs to all PART holders, it needs their approval to draw funds from it.</p><p>Indeed, to incentivize more use of the CCS system by the community, the team is going to open up the Community Fund. All you’ll need to do to claim the funds is craft a clear proposal that requires a vote and explains your initiative in detail as well as why you need the funds. Then, you need to convince the Particl community to vote in favor of your proposal and approve the claim of funds.</p><h1 id=\"first-proposal-coming-in-on-wednesday-\">First Proposal Coming in on Wednesday!</h1><p>You won’t have to wait for too long to put on your first vote! As soon as this <strong>Wednesday (28th of April, 2021)</strong>, we will publish the first-ever proposal to require the use of the on-chain voting system.<br><br>This proposal, which was widely requested by the community, seeks to nominate the Particl team as managers of the manual claim process required to unfreeze all legitimate anon and blind coins. These coins are currently frozen as part of the emergency hardfork deployed by the team weeks ago and they need to be re-enabled as smoothly as possible. Keep an eye out on Particl News and the CCS on Wednesday for all the details on the proposal!</p><hr><p>With the support of the on-chain voting system as well as the upcoming few proposals, the Particl project is entering a brand new phase that emphasizes the power of the community much more. If you’ve ever had a great idea for a project, business, or service you think would benefit the Particl ecosystem, you’ll have all the tools you need to make it happen, if you can convince the community!</p><p>This addition to the CCS marks a significant milestone for the project and should lead to many more community contributions than we’ve ever seen. Don’t forget, if the decentralized treasury model proposal is approved, the Community Fund is also going to grow in value and, if the price of PART increases, will grow exponentially in value, opening even more doors. This has tremendous potential and we can’t wait to see what you, the community, will create with these resources!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

Core 0.19.2.6 and \nParticl Desktop 2.3.6. These releases aim to ease and streamline the process of\nidentifying anon and blind outputs to assist the team in selecting the best path\nforward and help reveal exploited outputs that can then be blacklisted.\n\nBelow this post, you’ll find a detailed progress report for Particl V3. If you\nwant to jump straight to it, you can click here.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop 2.3.6 and Particl Core 0.19.2.6\nRelease Particl Desktop v2.3.6 · particl/particl-desktopThis patch release\nincludes some minor usability enhancements.NB!! The source code linked to here\nis not the actual tagged release source code. Please contact Particl for source\ncode information. ...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.6] * Desktop\n   download: [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.0.1]\n   https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.6\n * Core\n   download: [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.3]\n   https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.6\n\nParticl Desktop 2.3.6 introduces a new GUI tool to quickly identify the anon and\nblind outputs from all your unlocked wallets. It uses the new Particl Core\n0.19.2.6 release, which improves the output tracing script.\n\nTo see the complete list of changes for Particl Core 0.19.2.6, follow this link\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/branch_0.19.2.6/doc/release-notes-particl.md#01926]\n.\n\nTo use the new tool, simply follow these steps.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1- Open Particl Desktop 2.3.6 and ensure you are running Particl Core 0.19.2.6.\n\n2- Unlock all of your wallets by opening each of them in the bar on the left and\nclicking the lock pad icon at the top right corner of the client.\n\n3- Once all your wallets are unlocked, click on the printer icon at the top\nright corner of the client and a new window will appear.\n\n4- Choose where you want to export your output data, and then click on the \nExport button.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter clicking the Export button, a file named frozen_blinded_data.txt will be\ncreated in the location of your choice. To submit this file to the Particl team,\nsend it to Tecnovert (@tecnovert:matrix.org) on Riot/Element or to Cryptoguard \neither on Telegram/Riot/Element/Discord or by email at cryptoguard@particl.io.\n\nThank you for participating in this output submission process; it will help the\nteam select the best path forward to re-enable frozen outputs and blacklist\nexploited ones!\n\n> Note: Running Particl Desktop 2.3.6 will automatically update your Particl Core\nnode to the latest version. You shouldn’t need to download the new Particl Core\nversion separately unless you want to collect your outputs without using Particl\nDesktop.\nParticl V3 Progress Report\nWe are happy today to also provide a detailed Particl V3 progress report. This\nlist contains all the recent bug fixes and outstanding items since the last\nParticl V3 progress report.\n\nAdditionally, it can now be announced that any slowdown in the progress of\nParticl V3, as mentioned in the March Project Update, has been duly resolved.\nThe development of Particl V3 is now back at a regular pace.\n\nTo-Do\nA list of remaining fixes to include before Particl V3 can go live on mainnet.\nSome of these items are already fixed but require additional testing while the\nothers are relatively minor, except for the zmq.node issue that occurs for some\nWindows users.\n\n * Once a market is blacklisted, it does not allow for further processing of any\n   related activity. For example, the market cannot be removed, product\n   templates for the market cannot be created, etc. The fix has been implemented\n   and is currently in testing phase.\n * An expired listing item that has been added to the cart is automatically\n   removed from the particl-market but remains added to the cart. The fix has\n   been implemented and is currently in testing phase.\n * A situation can occur during which releasing the escrow without completing\n   the “shipping” step can result in both parties becoming stuck in the\n   “shipping step”. The fix has been implemented and is currently in testing\n   phase.\n * Category filter for general markets other than the default Open Marketplace\n   does not work as expected. The fix has been implemented and is currently in\n   testing phase.\n * The change implemented to fix the category filter requires a change to the\n   implementation of selecting a category during the product template\n   creation/editing.\n * Fix the zmq.node error on startup occurring on some Windows machines.\n * Allow external links listed via the Help and Support page to open in the\n   user's browser instead of inside a self-contained webview \"window\". There are\n   some concerns about this, so this will likely be temporary until a better\n   solution can be implemented.\n * Add dynamic loading screen quotations.\n * There is no means to delete a published product from the Inventory tab.\n * Display the category creation modal or otherwise direct the user to the\n   category creation process after creating a new storefront market.\n * Add additional text to the market creation section to ensure that there is no\n   confusion about the market being private by default and only being known if\n   the market details are explicitly shared with others or the market is\n   promoted.\n\nIn Progress\nA list of items currently being worked on.\n\n * Updating Particl Desktop code in V3 to be compatible with recent API\n   improvements applied in particl-market. Needs some significant testing to\n   ensure all things are working, so takes a non-trivial amount of time to\n   complete.\n * In the wallet module, the Address label is not clearly indicated that it\n   requires additional action (clicking the button) to save the label.\n * Test Particl Core 0.19.2.6 with Particl Desktop 3.0, fixing any issues that\n   may occur.\n\nCompleted\nA list of the items that have been completed since the last Particl V3 progress\nreport.\n\n * Add 32-bit Windows builds back in as before.\n * Setting all shipping costs to 0 causes some errors while publishing a product\n   and purchasing.\n * On the listings page, add a checkbox-like control to each item to avoid\n   confusion about unselecting a selected country.\n * Allow for the transaction ID to be selected/copied in the Transaction table.\n * Ensure the 'Show inactive and archived' checkbox in the Orders pages is\n   checked/enabled by default to prevent orders from seemingly disappearing once\n   they are complete.\n * Fixed an error that appeared when the Particl Desktop application is closed\n   while the marketplace is starting.\n * A menu dropdown with no additional identities for selection now indicates no\n   alternative identities for selection (rather than displaying nothing).\n * Presents a missing \"unlock wallet\" prompt when creating a market with an\n   encrypted wallet/identity.\n * Display an alternative error message when accepting a bid fails due to having\n   insufficient available funds.\n * Swap the position of the public and anon balance values in the Market\n   Overview display.\n * Updated a setting description to describe its intended purpose more\n   accurately.\n\nETA\nDue to the recent inflationary bug, all anon and blind outputs are temporarily\nfrozen. And because the Particl Marketplace works using anon and blind outputs,\nit is not operational until the upcoming hardfork that unfreezes outputs occurs.\n\nFor this reason, a mainnet release of Particl V3 is not possible until the\nhardfork. In the meantime, you can expect one or more testnet releases of\nParticl V3 to properly test all the new bug fixes and improvements made to it\nsince the first testnet release.\n\nIf the mainnet release is entirely ready before the hardfork takes place, the\nteam will start working on additional Particl Desktop deliverables/features in a\nseparate branch which may, or may not, be merged in time for the first V3\nmainnet release. If a feature has been started and is not ready for release when\nthe hardfork takes place, it’ll then be included in a subsequent release.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This legal\nentity has served the purpose of funding the development and management of\nParticl as well as supporting the project legally using funds that it raised\nfrom the community in 2017.\n\nAs of November 2020, after slightly more than three years, the Particl\nFoundation has run out of the funds it raised from community donations and as\nsuch, has initiated its shutdown process. A mandatory closure audit is currently\nunderway.\n\nAs a result, the Particl team has since then voluntarily supported the project\nsince no funds are available anymore to pay for salaries, expenses, and fund\ndevelopment and initiatives.\n\nWith today's fast-paced and rapidly evolving blockchain industry, any serious\nproject needs to have enough funding to support its ecosystem, promote its\nproduct(s), and grow its community. Equally important is the necessity to have\nlegal representation so that the project can effectively and safely interact\nwith other parties, manage funds, and own assets (i.e., servers). Without any of\nthis, projects expose themselves to being overrun by competitors who don’t have\nthe same financial struggles.\n\nTo address this critical issue, the Particl team has consulted with a few\nadvisors and community leaders and put together a proposal for a new \ndecentralized treasury model that, if approved by the Particl community, could \nbring enough funding to self-sustain the project at current prices, boost\ncommunity resources, and provide a brand new legal entity to support the project\n.\n\nThis blog post will explain, in full detail, every aspect of the new\ndecentralized treasury model; how it works, its benefits and its parameters.\nThis is a first step aimed at getting you familiarized with the proposed idea.\n\nThen, in a separate blog post that will be published in the next few days on\nParticl News, we will publish a full breakdown of how the Particl team intends\nto claim and use those funds, restructure the project, stimulate the community\nand bring the Particl ecosystem to the next level in all aspects.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Contents\n * The Proposal in Short\n * Proposal Approval and Treasury Governance\n * Funding CCS Initiatives With a Community Fund\n * Additional Benefits\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Proposal in Short\nThis decentralized treasury model proposal, which is closely modelled after that\nof successful projects such as Siacoin and Decred, aims at firing up and\nexpanding Particl into a stronger-than-ever ecosystem by generating more PART\nthat can be put to use to the benefit of the project. The Particl team would\nthen claim funds from this treasury by pushing CCS proposals either quarterly or\nbi-annually.\n\nTo preserve a good level of decentralization and ensure community consensus, the\nintroduction of this new treasury model requires approval from the community\nthrough an on-chain voting process that’s going to be opened up in the days to\ncome. If approved, the modifications necessary to activate the new treasury\nmodel will be included in the upcoming hardfork that re-enables RingCT and CT\ntransactions.\n\nSelf-Sustainability—The Numbers in Detail\n * Circulating supply post-hardfork (estimate): ~11,750,000 PART\n * Proposed yearly inflation rate: 8%\n * Proposed treasury block rewards: 50%\n * Proposed total yearly staking rate (APR for stakers): 4%\n * Proposed yearly treasury rewards (estimates): 470,000 PART\n * Monthly treasury rewards (averaged from estimates): 39,166 PART\n\n> Note: If the proposal is approed, the current 10% “development staking reward”\nis going to be abolished in profit of the new decentralized treasury model.\nIn summary, the proposal for this new decentralized treasury model suggests\nincreasing the yearly inflation rate from 2% to 8% for two years and then \ndecreasing it by 1% every two years until it reaches 6% and stays at that level.\nEvery time the network stakes a block, 50% of the block rewards would then be\nredistributed to stakers and 50% into the Treasury Fund to fund, support,\npromote, and grow the project. That amounts to 4% of the total circulating\nsupply every year.\n\nThis brings the yearly PART staking interest (APY) to a minimum of 4%. Because\nAPY depends on how many coins in total are staking on the network, the true APY\nalways ends up being higher than its minimum rate. For example, if 50% of all\nthe PART coins are staking on the network, the staking APY goes from 4% to\naround 8% yearly.\n\nThis proposed treasury model is all about self-sustainability. Indeed, it\nprovides enough funding in PART to the project to cover salaries for the core\nteam, pay for all related expenses, and fund various promotional budgets at\ncurrent (and lower) PART prices. It also gives the extra resources required to\nexpand the team with more talents and add more expertise to the table. More\ndetails on the internal restructuring of the team and how it intends to claim\nand use those funds will be provided in a separate blog post published in a few\ndays on Particl News.\n\nDuring its first year, the Treasury Fund would earn an average of 39,166 PART\nevery month. This is sufficient, at current price levels of PART = $1, to\nsustain the project and fund various initiatives to take Particl to the next\nlevel. The proposed model is viable down to a PART price of around $0.50.\n\nOf course, the Treasury Fund exclusively gets funded with PART. An increase in\nthe trading value of the coin would then make the incoming revenue more valuable\nin fiat, allowing the team to expand further, fund more initiatives/programs,\nstimulate the community to a greater degree, and accelerate the growth of the\nentire ecosystem even more. For this reason, the Treasury Fund has exponential\ngrowth potential, but it's also important to note that a reduction in the price\nof PART can also have an adverse effect.\n\nProposal Approval and Treasury Governance\nThe Particl team has long been looking to decentralize the project further and\nput more power into the hands of the community. That’s the true spirit of\nblockchain technology, after all, and this is precisely what this new\ndecentralized treasury model achieves.\n\nAs such, this new treasury model is being suggested as a CCS proposal and\nrequires community approval to be set in motion. If the vote passes and the\nproposal is approved, the new treasury model will be put in place in the\nupcoming hardfork.\n\nAs for the governance of the Treasury Fund itself, you, the community, will have\nthe final say over it. To claim funds from it, the Particl team will publish CCS\nproposals every quarter or on a bi-annual basis, depending on a few factors at\nthe time the proposals are published. These proposals will detail how the funds\nare intended to be used, the objectives for the claim period, and what to expect\nin terms of deliverables.\n\nAs mentioned earlier in this blog post, the Particl team will publish shortly a\nseparate blog post exclusively focused on explaining how it will be restructured\nin light of this new decentralized governance (including a brand new legal\nentity), how it intends to claim and use funds moving forward, as well as its\nobjectives and deliverables.\n\nCommunity Governance and On-Chain Voting\nTo approve CCS proposals and claims of funds, the community will be invited to\nvote through the on-chain voting mechanism built into Particl Core. This voting\nsystem uses staking weight, meaning the number of coins being staked, as voting\ntickets. The more coins you stake on the Particl network, the greater your voice\nin these voting events.\n\nIt is possible to vote using clients such as Particl CLI, Particl Desktop, and\nParticl-Qt, but the best way to do it is through Particl’s cold staking\napplication Partyman. To facilitate the process of voting, a GUI integration has\nbeen added to the CCS, effectively tying proposals to on-chain voting events.\n\nMore information about the on-chain voting system, including the consensus and\nquorum requirements, will also be published in a separate blog post focused on\nthe on-chain voting scheduled for in a few days on Particl News.\n\nFunding CCS Initiatives With a Community Fund\nThe implementation of the treasury model, combined with the on-chain voting\nsystem integration into the CCS, will also enable brand-new opportunities at the\ncommunity level. Every month, a number of PART coins coming from the\ndecentralized treasury fund will be sent into a community-governed fund.\n\nThis Community Fund\n[https://explorer.particl.io/address/RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM], which\nalready contains ~25,818 PART coins as a result of unclaimed PART during the\ncoin swap event in 2017, will be made available to the community to be used to\nfund CCS initiatives. For an initiative to be funded by the Community Fund, it\nneeds to first go through a voting process, reach a voting quorum (minimum\nnumber of coins having voted), and approval rate. If that is achieved, then the\nproposal is officially approved by the community. According to the milestone\nschedule, the correct number of coins will be sent from the Community Fund to\nthe initiative’s custodian.\n\nAdditional Benefits\nWhile this blog post simply exclusively intends on explaining the decentralized\ntreasury model proposal, here are some of the benefits it will provide to the\nproject if approved. Of course, much more information on that end will be\npublished in the blog post that will explain how the team intends on using those\nfunds coming in just a few days.\n\n * Complete restructuring of the team’s internal processes, management,\n   leadership, and communications (internal and external).\n * Team expansion as price and market situation permits.\n * More active and rapid development as well as a more constant release\n   schedule.\n * More regular, streamlined, and transparent communication/updates.\n * More active, engaged, and blooming community and ecosystem.\n * More focus on deliverables other than Particl Core, the marketplace, and\n   Particl Desktop.\n * Renewed efforts in getting listed on more prominent exchanges.\n * More financial and human resources to market Particl’s products (i.e. PART\n   coin, Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap DEX, etc.)\n * Many more promotional and user acquisition initiatives.\n * And more…\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe hope that you are as excited as we are about this proposal. It has the power\nto significantly change things around and give the project the spark it needs to\nget the exposure, recognition, resources, and workforce behind it that it\ndeserves.\n\nAs we finally move ahead with a lot of what's been in the works for the last\nweeks, keep an eye out on Particl News and the CCS this week and the next one.\nWe will start publishing lots of new content including follow-up blog posts and\nthe CCS proposals. We invite you to take part in the discussion related to these\nproposals in their respective comment section on the CCS as they get published.\n\nLet’s get this proposal approved, and let’s take Particl to a whole new level!\n\n> The Particl team\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

Every time the network stakes a block,<strong> 50% of the block rewards</strong> would then be redistributed to stakers and <strong>50% into the Treasury Fund</strong> to fund, support, promote, and grow the project.

proceeded to an emergency\nhardfork to fix a critical bug in the code that allowed for the creation of\ncoins in anon balances. The hardfork fixed the issue and temporarily froze anon\nand blind outputs so that exploited ones couldn’t be used anymore.\n\nToday’s post will provide all the details on the way forward post-bug, including\nthe roadmap to closure, the process of re-enabling legitimate outputs,\nestimates, how to help the team out, and more.\n\nThis is a rather important blog post so make sure you read it carefully.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Content\n * Current Figures and Estimations\n * How to Reactivate Legitimate Outputs\n * Supply and Staking Implications\n   [/roadmap-to-post-inflation-hardfork/supply-and-staking-implications]\n * The Roadmap to the Coming Hardfork\n * Help the Team Gather More Information\n * AMA for Any Remaining Questions\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCurrent Figures and Estimations\nAt this moment, it is confirmed that 768,767 PART coins have been successfully\nexploited and transferred back to public balances\n[https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/]. This number can be\nconfirmed by auditing the observed public outputs and comparing the resulting\nfigure with the expected supply.\n\nFor clarity, “observed public outputs” refers to the total number of coins held\nin public balances. In contrast, the “expected public supply” is the number of\ncoins that should be in circulation if a hack never occurred. The expected\nsupply value can be verified by taking Particl’s initial supply and adding all\nthe coins created through staking rewards. The blockchain displays this value\nwhen entering the gettxoutsetinfo command.\n\nBut the extra coins held in public balance are not the only factor contributing\nto Particl’s true post-bug supply. Indeed, legitimate anon outputs, or the total\nnumber of legitimate coins held in anon balances by users, need to be added to\nit. That’s because the current figure of 768,767 extra coins only takes into\naccount public balances. Any legitimate coin held in anon balances will need to\nbe sent to public balances to be re-enabled, bringing the total number of\nexploited coins up as it happens.\n\nIn this case, and based on outputs, blinding factors, and information that have\nbeen already provided by various community members to the team so far, it can be\nconfirmed that at least 770,000 legitimate coins are being held in anon outputs.\nThis brings the confirmed total of exploited coins to 1,538,767 coins (770,000 +\n768,767). This would mean that, if no additional legitimate coin is confirmed to\nbe in anon balances, the post-bug supply of the Particl network will stand at\n11,286,973 coins (1,538,767 + 9,748,206).\n\nOf course, the team expects a few more outputs to be confirmed as the process of\nre-enabling outputs officially begins. Still, it’s likely that the final figure\nshouldn’t diverge by a wide margin from what’s already established.\n\nHow to Reactivate Legitimate Outputs\nOn the March 2021 Project Update\n[https://particl.news/project-update-march-2021/], we mentioned two different\ntechniques that users who have frozen outputs can use to re-enable their coins.\nSince then, we’ve collected and considered community feedback and have improved\nthe solutions to bring more confidence into the process, minimize the burden put\nonto the affected users, and increase privacy. Please read what follows\ncarefully.\n\nLow Pass Filter\nThe easiest way to re-enable legitimate frozen outputs is to use a “low pass\nfilter” tool that will be integrated directly into the Particl Core release that\nwill trigger the coming hardfork. This aims at re-enabling most\nmarketplace-related anon and blind outputs.\n\nThis low pass filter tool allows users with frozen outputs that contain a low\nnumber of coins to automatically re-enable coins. The value of the low pass\nfilter is currently set at 500 coins, meaning any output containing 500 coins or\nless will be able to be effortlessly moved back to a public balance. The low\npass filter's final threshold value may change depending on various factors\nbefore the hardfork goes live but is likely to remain at 500.\n\nThis is the easiest solution for users to re-enable their coins. If your outputs\nqualify for the low pass filter, then all you have to do is wait for the next\nhardfork. You’ll then be able to enter a single command, per output, into your\nParticl Core debug window, which will unfreeze your coins.\n\nIf you wish to keep your coins in anon after re-enabling them, you’ll have to\nfirst transfer them into a public balance and then transfer them back to a new\npost-fork anon address.\n\nManual Claim Process\nIf you own outputs too large for the low pass filter, you will have to go\nthrough a manual claim process. Since this solution was first announced in the \nMarch 2021 Project Update [https://particl.news/project-update-march-2021/], the\nteam has collected feedback from various community members and has come up with\na more streamlined process that would preserve the decentralization of the\nprocess.\n\nInitially, it was planned that every user would need to push a CCS proposal to\nre-enable their outputs. That is to ensure the team has no overbearing power\nover the network and that any output validated is duly approved by the\ncommunity.\n\nWe now propose a more streamlined, private, and straightforward way to process\nthese claims while still retaining decentralization. To simplify the process,\nthe Particl team will push, in the next few days, a proposal on the CCS asking\nfor the community to nominate the team as the managers of the claim process.\n\nIf approved, users will need to send their claims to the team through a secure\nchannel, using a tracer script that can be run within the Particl Core client.\nThis script dumps the amounts, blinding factors, and anon inputs for each step\nuntil it gets to a transaction with plain inputs. It can also optionally dump\nthe privkeys to spent anon outputs to prove the claimed input is correct by\nrecreating the keyimage. However, in most cases, it shouldn’t be necessary.\nAdditional information may be required if the script isn’t enough to fully\nvalidate the source of the funds, although that, too, shouldn’t be necessary in\nthe great majority of cases. This will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe team will then approve or reject individual claims based on the collected\ndata. Any approved claim would be included in a whitelist that will lead to an\ninstant re-enabling of legitimate outputs once the hardfork goes live.\n\nIf a user gets his claim rejected by the team, he will then be able to plead his\ncase to the community by pushing an independent CCS proposal. Claims validated\nby the community through independent CCS proposals will then be added to a\nseparate whitelist, re-enabling the outputs whenever the team proceeds with\nanother hardfork later on in the future.\n\nThis improved solution aims to provide more confidence in the process, reduce\nthe burden put on the user, and increase privacy.\n\n> Note: Voting parameters and consensus requirements will be detailed on a\nseparate blog post focused exclusively on the on-chain voting mechanism.\nSupply and Staking Implications\nBecause this inflation bug led to new coins being created out of thin air, the\ncurrent expected supply of Particl is out of sync with the real supply. To fix\nthat issue, the supply of Particl will be adjusted based on three different\nfactors.\n\n 1. On the day of the coming hardfork, the supply will be increased by the sum\n    of all the coins contained in the whitelist. For example, if there’s a total\n    of 1,000,000 coins in the whitelist, then the supply of Particl will be\n    raised by 1,000,000 on the day of the hardfork.\n 2. The total supply will also be adjusted to the current observed supply, which\n    is the expected supply + the excess of coins in public balances that has\n    already been confirmed in the initial vulnerability disclosure\n    [https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/]. That sums up to a\n    total of 768,767 coins.\n 3. The supply will also be dynamically adjusted every time frozen blinded coins\n    are spent through the low pass filter. If, for example, 50,000 coins are\n    re-enabled using the filter, then the supply will increase by that same\n    amount. To be noted, there are a total of 4,204 unspent anon outputs and\n    1,701 blind ones, of which 420 are not tainted. That means the absolute\n    maximum number of PART coins that can be re-enabled using the low pass\n    filter, if 100% of the outputs contain precisely 500 PART, is 2,952,500 PART\n    coins. However, it is expected that most outputs that will pass through the\n    filter will be on the low end; mostly composed of change or dust outputs and\n    small balances reserved for the Particl Marketplace. Many of these outputs\n    also won’t qualify either because they contain too many coins or because\n    they have already been flagged as fraudulent.\n\nDue to the three factors mentioned here, the real supply of the Particl\nblockchain should stabilize a few days after the coming hardfork.\n\nThe Roadmap to the Coming Hardfork\nThe coming hardfork will provide closure to this inflationary bug event and\nallow the team to jump back into building the Particl ecosystem. Once it goes\nlive, the vast majority of frozen outputs that are legitimate will be re-enabled\nand both anon as well blind balances will be re-activated. That’ll allow Particl\nV3 to go live on mainnet.\n\nThere are still a few events that need to happen before that hardfork can go\nlive. Here is a clear roadmap of what’s left to do before then. Each item is\nmore or less in chronological order.\n\nFinalize and Test the Tracer Script\nParticl Core Developer Tecnovert has been working on the “tracer script” which,\nwhen executed in a Particl client, will automatically validate the legitimacy of\nmany frozen outputs by tracing anon outputs back to public ones.\n\nThe script is currently being finalized and incrementally tested with outputs\nthat have already been provided to the team by a couple of community members.\n\nVote to Nominate the Team as Claim Managers\nAs mentioned earlier in this blog post, the team will soon be pushing a proposal\nto the CCS system to be nominated as managers of the claim process. If approved\nby the community, users will be able to submit their proof directly to the team\ninstead of pushing independent proposals. If the team rejects a claim, the user\nwill still be able to plead his case to the community by making a CCS proposal\nof his own.\n\n> Note: A voting period lasts two weeks and requires at least one week of\npre-notice for discussion and to give enough time for people to become aware of\nit.\nProcess Manual Claims and Compile the Whitelist\nAfter the team’s proposal is approved, claims will need to be collected and\nvalidated. All claims that get approved will be added to a whitelist which will\nautomatically re-enable validated outputs once the next hardfork goes live.\n\nVote On the New Treasury Model and Implement It\nAs a final item before the next hardfork will go live, the team will push a\nsecond proposal to activate the new treasury model. This new treasury model will\nbring funding to the team and allow the Particl project to be back at full\nforce.\n\nIf approved, the team will include the changes (which are relatively simple to\ninclude all things considered) into the code and activate the new treasury model\nwith the next hardfork.\n\nExpect a standalone blog post about this new proposed treasury model on Particl\nNews within the next few days.\n\n> Note: A voting period lasts two weeks and requires at least one week of\npre-notice. The proposal will be published after the first week of the voting\nperiod to nominate the team as claim managers so that both voting periods can be\ncompleted as quickly as possible for the hardfork to go through.\nAt this time, we are looking for the hardfork to go live in around 6 weeks.\nThat’s the time required for both votes to go through and for everything to be\nready. If they are both approved, then the hardfork will re-enable frozen\noutputs and activate the new treasury model at the same time. The team also\nhopes that it can release the Particl V3 mainnet release simultaneously,\nalthough that remains to be seen. As always, this is an estimate based on the\ninformation currently available.

In this\nclient, you'll find a \"printer\" icon at the top right of your screen with a\nsimple button to automate steps 1 to 6 in the following section.\nTo improve the tracer script and flag as many exploited outputs as possible, the\nteam is looking to gather as much information as it can. To help the team out on\nthat quest, Particl Core Developer Tecnovert has put together a series of\ncommands you can enter in any of your wallets that has ever had an anon/blind\nbalance or transaction.\n\n1- Download the latest pre-release of Particl Core (Qt) here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.6alpha2].\n\nRelease 0.19.2.6 Alpha 2 · tecnovert/particl-coreTo downgrade to a previous\nrelease, run debugwallet {\\“downgrade_wallets\\”:true} from the later\nrelease.Hashes668c254e9a0e7d4521d53868ece2691a520f6b2c86976aebdbb6e3b2a5d743ee\nparticl-0.19.2.6-aa...GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.6alpha2]2- Load all your wallets that have or have had anon transactions and/or frozen\noutputs.\n\n3- Open the debug console located in the \"Window\" tab at the top of the wallet.\n\n4- Don't forget to switch your debug console window to the wallet with anon\ntransactions/outputs.

This number can be confirmed by auditing the observed public outputs and comparing the resulting figure with the expected supply.</p><p>For clarity, “observed public outputs” refers to the total number of coins held in public balances. In contrast, the “expected public supply” is the number of coins that should be in circulation if a hack never occurred. The expected supply value can be verified by taking Particl’s initial supply and adding all the coins created through staking rewards. The blockchain displays this value when entering the <code>gettxoutsetinfo</code> command.</p><p>But the extra coins held in public balance are not the only factor contributing to Particl’s true post-bug supply. Indeed, legitimate anon outputs, or the total number of legitimate coins held in anon balances by users, need to be added to it. That’s because the current figure of 768,767 extra coins only takes into account public balances. Any legitimate coin held in anon balances will need to be sent to public balances to be re-enabled, bringing the total number of exploited coins up as it happens.</p><p>In this case, and based on outputs, blinding factors, and information that have been already provided by various community members to the team so far, it can be confirmed that at least 770,000 legitimate coins are being held in anon outputs. This brings the confirmed total of exploited coins to 1,538,767 coins (770,000 + 768,767). This would mean that, if no additional legitimate coin is confirmed to be in anon balances, the post-bug supply of the Particl network will stand at 11,286,973 coins (1,538,767 + 9,748,206).</p><p>Of course, the team expects a few more outputs to be confirmed as the process of re-enabling outputs officially begins. Still, it’s likely that the final figure shouldn’t diverge by a wide margin from what’s already established.</p><h1 id=\"how-to-reactivate-legitimate-outputs\">How to Reactivate Legitimate Outputs</h1><p>On the <a href=\"https://particl.news/project-update-march-2021/\"><strong>March 2021 Project Update</strong></a>, we mentioned two different techniques that users who have frozen outputs can use to re-enable their coins. Since then, we’ve collected and considered community feedback and have improved the solutions to bring more confidence into the process, minimize the burden put onto the affected users, and increase privacy. Please read what follows carefully.</p><h3 id=\"low-pass-filter\">Low Pass Filter</h3><p>The easiest way to re-enable legitimate frozen outputs is to use a “low pass filter” tool that will be integrated directly into the Particl Core release that will trigger the coming hardfork. This aims at re-enabling most marketplace-related anon and blind outputs.</p><p>This low pass filter tool allows users with frozen outputs that contain a low number of coins to automatically re-enable coins. The value of the low pass filter is currently set at 500 coins, meaning any output containing 500 coins or less will be able to be effortlessly moved back to a public balance. The low pass filter's final threshold value may change depending on various factors before the hardfork goes live but is likely to remain at 500.</p><p>This is the easiest solution for users to re-enable their coins. If your outputs qualify for the low pass filter, then all you have to do is wait for the next hardfork. You’ll then be able to enter a single command, per output, into your Particl Core debug window, which will unfreeze your coins.</p><p>If you wish to keep your coins in anon after re-enabling them, you’ll have to first transfer them into a public balance and then transfer them back to a new post-fork anon address.</p><h3 id=\"manual-claim-process\">Manual Claim Process</h3><p>If you own outputs too large for the low pass filter, you will have to go through a manual claim process. Since this solution was first announced in the <a href=\"https://particl.news/project-update-march-2021/\"><strong>March 2021 Project Update</strong></a>, the team has collected feedback from various community members and has come up with a more streamlined process that would preserve the decentralization of the process.</p><p>Initially, it was planned that every user would need to push a CCS proposal to re-enable their outputs. That is to ensure the team has no overbearing power over the network and that any output validated is duly approved by the community.</p><p>We now propose a more streamlined, private, and straightforward way to process these claims while still retaining decentralization. To simplify the process, the Particl team will push, in the next few days, a proposal on the CCS asking for the community to nominate the team as the managers of the claim process.</p><p>If approved, users will need to send their claims to the team through a secure channel, using a tracer script that can be run within the Particl Core client. This script dumps the amounts, blinding factors, and anon inputs for each step until it gets to a transaction with plain inputs. It can also optionally dump the privkeys to spent anon outputs to prove the claimed input is correct by recreating the keyimage. However, in most cases, it shouldn’t be necessary. Additional information may be required if the script isn’t enough to fully validate the source of the funds, although that, too, shouldn’t be necessary in the great majority of cases. This will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>The team will then approve or reject individual claims based on the collected data. Any approved claim would be included in a whitelist that will lead to an instant re-enabling of legitimate outputs once the hardfork goes live.</p><p>If a user gets his claim rejected by the team, he will then be able to plead his case to the community by pushing an independent CCS proposal. Claims validated by the community through independent CCS proposals will then be added to a separate whitelist, re-enabling the outputs whenever the team proceeds with another hardfork later on in the future.</p><p>This improved solution aims to provide more confidence in the process, reduce the burden put on the user, and increase privacy.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> Voting parameters and consensus requirements will be detailed on a separate blog post focused exclusively on the on-chain voting mechanism.</em></blockquote><h1 id=\"supply-and-staking-implications\">Supply and Staking Implications</h1><p>Because this inflation bug led to new coins being created out of thin air, the current expected supply of Particl is out of sync with the real supply. To fix that issue, the supply of Particl will be adjusted based on three different factors.</p><ol><li>On the day of the coming hardfork, the supply will be increased by the sum of all the coins contained in the whitelist. For example, if there’s a total of 1,000,000 coins in the whitelist, then the supply of Particl will be raised by 1,000,000 on the day of the hardfork.</li><li>The total supply will also be adjusted to the current observed supply, which is the expected supply + the excess of coins in public balances that has already been confirmed in the <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/\"><strong>initial vulnerability disclosure</strong></a>. That sums up to a total of 768,767 coins.</li><li>The supply will also be dynamically adjusted every time frozen blinded coins are spent through the low pass filter. If, for example, 50,000 coins are re-enabled using the filter, then the supply will increase by that same amount. To be noted, there are a total of 4,204 unspent anon outputs and 1,701 blind ones, of which 420 are not tainted. That means the absolute maximum number of PART coins that can be re-enabled using the low pass filter, if 100% of the outputs contain precisely 500 PART, is 2,952,500 PART coins. However, it is expected that most outputs that will pass through the filter will be on the low end; mostly composed of change or dust outputs and small balances reserved for the Particl Marketplace. Many of these outputs also won’t qualify either because they contain too many coins or because they have already been flagged as fraudulent.</li></ol><p>Due to the three factors mentioned here, the real supply of the Particl blockchain should stabilize a few days after the coming hardfork.</p><h1 id=\"the-roadmap-to-the-coming-hardfork\">The Roadmap to the Coming Hardfork</h1><p>The coming hardfork will provide closure to this inflationary bug event and allow the team to jump back into building the Particl ecosystem. Once it goes live, the vast majority of frozen outputs that are legitimate will be re-enabled and both anon as well blind balances will be re-activated. That’ll allow Particl V3 to go live on mainnet.</p><p>There are still a few events that need to happen before that hardfork can go live. Here is a clear roadmap of what’s left to do before then. Each item is more or less in chronological order.</p><h3 id=\"finalize-and-test-the-tracer-script\">Finalize and Test the Tracer Script</h3><p>Particl Core Developer Tecnovert has been working on the “tracer script” which, when executed in a Particl client, will automatically validate the legitimacy of many frozen outputs by tracing anon outputs back to public ones.</p><p>The script is currently being finalized and incrementally tested with outputs that have already been provided to the team by a couple of community members.</p><h3 id=\"vote-to-nominate-the-team-as-claim-managers\">Vote to Nominate the Team as Claim Managers</h3><p>As mentioned earlier in this blog post, the team will soon be pushing a proposal to the CCS system to be nominated as managers of the claim process. If approved by the community, users will be able to submit their proof directly to the team instead of pushing independent proposals. If the team rejects a claim, the user will still be able to plead his case to the community by making a CCS proposal of his own.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> A voting period lasts two weeks and requires at least one week of pre-notice for discussion and to give enough time for people to become aware of it.</em></blockquote><h3 id=\"process-manual-claims-and-compile-the-whitelist\">Process Manual Claims and Compile the Whitelist</h3><p>After the team’s proposal is approved, claims will need to be collected and validated. All claims that get approved will be added to a whitelist which will automatically re-enable validated outputs once the next hardfork goes live.</p><h3 id=\"vote-on-the-new-treasury-model-and-implement-it\">Vote On the New Treasury Model and Implement It</h3><p>As a final item before the next hardfork will go live, the team will push a second proposal to activate the new treasury model. This new treasury model will bring funding to the team and allow the Particl project to be back at full force.</p><p>If approved, the team will include the changes (which are relatively simple to include all things considered) into the code and activate the new treasury model with the next hardfork.</p><p>Expect a standalone blog post about this new proposed treasury model on Particl News within the next few days.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> A voting period lasts two weeks and requires at least one week of pre-notice. The proposal will be published after the first week of the voting period to nominate the team as claim managers so that both voting periods can be completed as quickly as possible for the hardfork to go through.</em></blockquote><p>At this time, we are looking for the hardfork to go live in around 6 weeks. That’s the time required for both votes to go through and for everything to be ready. If they are both approved, then the hardfork will re-enable frozen outputs and activate the new treasury model at the same time. The team also hopes that it can release the Particl V3 mainnet release simultaneously, although that remains to be seen. As always, this is an estimate based on the information currently available. We will communicate to the community if any delay occurs.</p><h1 id=\"help-the-team-gather-more-information\">Help the Team Gather More Information</h1><blockquote><em><strong>UPDATE:</strong> You can now more easily collect your outputs simply by downloading and installing <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.6\">Particl Desktop 2.3.6</a></strong>.

unforeseen event\n[https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/], the March Project\nUpdate has landed. This update is a major one and contains a lot of information\nabout what has transpired in the past few weeks and what’s coming ahead with\nParticl in 2021 and beyond. Indeed, you DON’T want to skip on this update so\nlet’s jump right into it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Contents\n * Latest Information on the Inflationary Bug and the Proposed Solutions\n * Particl V3 Update\n * A Proposal for an Improved and More Sustainable Treasury Model\n * Atomic Swaps are Coming to Particl Desktop\n * New CCS Proposal\n * Particl Ends 2020 Strongly in Global Github Commit Rankings\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLatest Information on the Inflationary Bug and the Proposed Solutions\nSince the initial disclosure of the inflationary vulnerability\n[https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/], the Particl team has\nbeen working on solutions to whitelist legitimate anon outputs but keep the\nexploited ones frozen in perpetuity. Today, we are happy to bring more details\nand clarity on the situation and explain the way forward.\n\nHardforks Schedule\nTo limit the impact of having RingCT and CT transactions disabled any further\n(such as, for example, the inability to release Particl V3 without it), the team\nhas opted to adopt a multi-fork approach instead of a two-fork one, as initially\nproposed.\n\nNext Hardfork\nThe next hardfork, which is expected to go live in April, will re-enable RingCT\nand CT transactions as well unfreeze the majority of legitimate outputs\ncurrently frozen. Once completed, it will also enable the Particl V3 release to\ngo live on mainnet.\n\nIf you want to know all the changes integrated into the second hardfork, please\nconsult its PR on Github by following this link: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-core/pull/81\n\nHf2 by tecnovert · Pull Request #81 · particl/particl-coreSecond fork of\nexploit\nfix. RCT exploit fix. Hard fork 2 consensus changes: All frozen anon and blind\noutputs must be spent to plain with no blinded change. Blinding factor sum for\nCT txns is ...GitHubparticl [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/pull/81]At\nthis time, the majority of the base requirements for the second hardfork to go\nlive are ready. The team is finalizing the portion of the code required to\nwhitelist outputs and undergoing a full RingCT and CT internal audit to ensure\nthe code's integrity before going live with the hardfork.\n\nAdditionally, the team is working separately on additional changes related to a\ntreasury model proposal which is detailed a bit further down this update. If the\ntreasury proposal is approved, it’ll be integrated into the code for the next\nhardfork.\n\nLegitimate Outputs Whitelisting Process\nUsers with legitimate anon or blind balances will be able to unfreeze and move\nthem back to public balances. For the vast majority of users, this will be\npossible right after the next hardfork goes live but, in some specific cases, a\nprocess involving more manual steps will be required. If you fall into that\ncategory, your anon and blind balances will be unfrozen in a subsequent hardfork\na bit later on after the next one.\n\nHere are the two methods used to unfreeze legitimate anon and blind balances.\n\n 1. A “low pass filter” will allow any output that contains a number of coins\n    below a certain threshold to be unfrozen. As the attacker generated large\n    outputs on which balance transfers were drawn from, this won’t unfreeze\n    exploited outputs. The exact value of the threshold will be confirmed in a\n    separate blog post coming shortly in the next week or two.\n 2. Users with legitimate balances larger than the low pass filter’s threshold\n    will need to go through a manual claim process that will require them to\n    prove the coins' legitimacy. This can be done using various methods. Which\n    method is used will be up to the user. Claims will need to be presented to\n    the community through a CCS proposal (using a template provided by the team)\n    and then be approved through on-chain voting. Once approved, the outputs\n    will be marked as unfrozen as soon as another hardfork goes live later in\n    the year. This process ensures that the entire process remains decentralized\n    and that no single party (in this case, the Particl team) can\n    single-handedly take such a critical decision. More details on this process\n    will also be provided in a separate blog post coming in a week or two on\n    Particl News.\n\nAs this claim process (option 2) requires manual input from users, a long-enough\ntime-frame will be granted to allow everyone that needs to go through it enough\ntime to do so.\n\nAdjusted Total Supply and Implications\nOne of the consequences of this bug is the inflation of the total supply, which\nisn’t yet reflected officially by the blockchain. In fact, because of the\nstealthy nature of the exploit, the total supply that the blockchain displays is\nthe one expected if there never was any inflationary bug. This will be adjusted\nto its actual value in two different ways.\n\nFirst off, the supply will dynamically adjust itself as users move their\nlegitimate anon and blind outputs through the low pass filter. Whenever a\nsuccessful low pass transaction occurs, the blockchain will automatically detect\nit and adjust its supply accordingly.\n\nSecondly, the supply will also be adjusted once the hardfork that whitelists\noutputs approved by the community through the CCS goes live. Any new coin being\nunfrozen through this process will be added to the total Particl supply.\n\nWhat this means is that, by the end of the manual claim process, the supply will\nbe fully adjusted to its true value and will display the real, post-inflation\nsupply. The team currently estimates the final number of exploited coins to\nrange between 1.5M and 2M, including the already-confirmed exploited coins\n(768,767 coins).\n\nPlease take note that this is just a rough estimate based on various information\nthe team has gathered since the first hardfork (holders who’ve contacted the\nteam, evidence on the blockchain, and so on). The actual number may end up being\nslightly higher, or slightly lower, but should ultimately trend towards those\nnumbers.\n\nOther Implications\nThis inflationary event also bears other implications for the network.\n\n * An increase in staking rewards size will be observed. In fact, the size of\n   rewards will go up by the same amount as the supply goes up. If, for example,\n   the total supply ends up being inflated by 15%, then staking rewards will\n   also grow in size by an equal 15%. That’s because staking rewards are\n   calculated based on a percentage of the total supply.\n * Other projects that had forked Particl’s RingCT protocol were contacted\n   privately and disclosed the vulnerability before the public announcement. The\n   Veil project has been contacted but found not to be vulnerable due to a\n   different implementation. The Ghost project, on the other hand, has been\n   found to be vulnerable but has swiftly patched the vulnerability. We’d like\n   to thank both teams for their support and urgency in addressing the\n   situation.\n\nParticl V3 Update\nIt can be reported that a significant slow down has been observed in the\nfinalization of Particl V3 in the past few weeks due to personal issues that led\nto a strain in time availability. This is in the process of being resolved and\nwe expect the development of Particl V3 and Particl Desktop to resume at its\nusual pace (and, more likely, at a faster pace than it used to) in the next few\ndays.\n\nFor this reason, we do not have any specific update on Particl V3 for the\nmoment, but we fully expect to have a report ready to go live before the next\nProject Update in April. We also expect the new testnet version to go live\nbefore that time.\n\nTo understand a bit more where things are headed for Particl and how the project\nis about to get back full steam ahead, carefully read the next section.\n\nA Proposal for an Improved and More Sustainable Treasury Model\nAs it was communicated a few months ago\n[https://particl.foundation/foundation-announcement], the Particl Foundation has\npaid all outstanding payments to its contractors (which includes developers).\nThis necessary action (due to agreed commitments with said contractors) has\nseverely depleted the Foundation’s reserves leading it to initiate its shutdown\nprocess.\n\nAs a result, the Particl team had to pause salaries until a new funding solution\nappeared, which caused the project to temporarily go back to a voluntary-based\ncontribution model. This has, unfortunately, led to a considerable reduction in\ntime availability for most of the team members due to other temporary\ncommitments needed to be made to make ends meet.\n\nAdditionally, the looming release of Particl V3, which is arguably the biggest\nParticl release ever since the project’s inception, is right around the corner\nwith only a few changes needed to be applied for it to go live on mainnet. The\nproblem? The team doesn’t have access to proper funding anymore to promote it at\nits just value and give it the exposure it deserves. This situation, combined\nwith the voluntary-basis contribution model that is in play, motivated the team\nto work on a creative but effective solution to get the project funded once\nagain and be back in action full steam ahead.\n\nA New and Improved Treasury Model\nFor the reasons mentioned above, and to ensure the proper development and\neffective promotion of the project in the many years to come, the team has been\nworking relentlessly on a new, more robust treasury model which would guarantee\nenough funding to support the project. This would ultimately provide the project\nwith just as much financial support as the project had at its peak and\neventually surpass this level.\n\nThe new treasury model being designed doesn’t aim at reinventing the wheel. At\ncurrent PART prices, self-sustainability can be achieved by tweaking the current\ntreasury model which, at this moment, reserves 10% of all the staking rewards to\nsupport the project. The Particl team is modelling the new treasury figures\nafter that of very successful and top-rated projects in the space such as\nDecred, Siacoin, and others which have adopted similar self-funding strategy.\nDoing so has proven to be an overwhelming and indisputable success for these\nprojects.\n\nWhat to Expect?\nWhile the numbers around the new treasury model are still being simulated and\nevaluated, this would allow for the immediate full funding of the Particl team\nat current PART prices and would provide enough funds to reserve in various\nbudgets aimed at supporting and promoting the project as well as stimulate user\ngrowth.\n\nAs the treasury model is based on PART staking, an increase in PART prices would\ndirectly translate to a more significant source of funding for the project which\ncould, eventually, be used to expand the team with new members (developers and\nnon-developers), fund campaigns (i.e. marketing, user growth, etc), fund\npromotional efforts, and fund various budgets such as exchange listings, just as\nan example. This model has, in fact, exponential potential.\n\nOf course, before any expansion process beings, the first step is to fire up the\nengine once again and stabilize the new Particl internal structure. A team\nexpansion is a time-consuming process with various considerations and thus, is\nplanned for when the time will be suitable for it.\n\nAs a result of this new source of funding, you can expect the Particl project to\nbe back in the midst of action and be as strong, and even stronger, as it was at\nits peak. You can also expect a much faster pace of development, more frequent\ncommunication, more transparency, more promotional efforts, more marketing, more\nuser growth/adoption initiatives, and so on. This is the key to ensure Particl’s\nsuccess not only this year but in the many years that stand ahead of us all.\n\nSubmitted as a CCS Proposal\nThe team is currently implementing a better UI for the on-chain voting system in\nthe CCS system and it should go live in a week or two. That’ll allow you to\nbetter visualize the proposals, current voting, and etc.\n\nBecause this new treasury model changes the values of the yearly staking\ninterest rate as well as the percentage of all staking rewards being reserved\nfor the development and promotion of the Particl project, community consensus\nhas to be achieved at the protocol level to ensure an optimal level of\ndecentralization.\n\nAnother important point is that all the block rewards going to the treasury fund\nwill require an on-chain vote to be spent. Every quarter, the Particl team will\nsubmit a CCS proposal to have its budget approved by the community using\non-chain voting. This ultimately gives the community the final say, furthers the\nlevel of decentralization of the project (and its governance), and keeps the\nteam accountable to every PART holder to ensure it always acts in the best\ninterest of the ecosystem.\n\nFull Details Coming in a Separate Blog Post\nJust like with the information surrounding the proposed solutions for the\ninflationary bug, the precise details, figures, and in-depth information about\nthe treasury model proposal will be posted in a separate blog post that is\nlikely to go out next week on Particl News. Stay tuned as the team is in the\nprocess of finalizing all the details!\n\nAtomic Swaps are Coming to Particl Desktop\nBut wait, there’s more being worked on! Over the past few months, a great\nsurprise has been cooking up and is now ready to be revealed; atomic swaps are\ncoming right to Particl Desktop thanks to a new Particl-based distributed\nexchange protocol.\n\nEarly Design of the BasicSwap-Powered Swap Module on Particl V3 (WIP)In fact,\nParticl Core Developer Tecnovert has been working on BasicSwap, an anonymous DEX\nprotocol that uses SMSG to allow people to swap, without any third-party,\ncryptocurrencies using atomic swaps. BasicSwap is currently functional and is in\nits Closed Beta phase where various testers have been experimenting with it for\na few weeks. This anonymous DEX protocol, which currently supports Particl,\nMonero, Bitcoin, and Litecoin, has many benefits that will go a long way in\nmaking PART and other cryptocurrencies more resilient and widely accessible to\nall.\n\nIt uses Particl’s SMSG P2P network and the atomic swap protocol to allow you to\nexchange cryptocurrencies without requiring a third-party or wrapped assets. The\nswaps are pretty fast; in fact, swapping PART for LTC averages 20 to 25 minutes\nper swap (after both transactions are fully confirmed), which is also the same\nfor PART/XMR swaps. Of course, the actual time required for a swap to fully\ncomplete is entirely dependent on the confirmation times of the two coins being\ntraded.\n\nCompleted Mainnet Swaps Using the BasicSwap Back-End (Mainnet)To make it as easy\nto use as possible, the BasicSwap protocol will eventually be integrated into\nthe user interface of Particl Desktop. Swapping cryptocurrencies will be\npossible through a new Particl V3 “Swap” module and won’t require the syncing of\nother coin nodes.\n\nThis new atomic swap module isn’t planned to be released with the initial\nmainnet launch of Particl V3 but is expected to go live in one of the subsequent\nfew Particl Desktop updates that come after it. Even though this project is\ncurrently being delayed due to the commitment required from Particl Core\nDeveloper Tecnovert to fix the inflationary bug, BasicSwap is fully expected to\nbe accelerated by the potential funding provided by the new treasury model.\n\nKeep an eye out for an announcement of an Open Beta as well as more information\nabout this tool as soon as the Particl developers can get back to working on\ntheir previous tasks after the inflationary bug is dealt with. That should come\nshortly after the release of Particl V3 on mainnet.\n\nNew CCS Proposal\nA few weeks ago, a new proposal was added to the CCS system. Authored by Particl\ncommunity member ffmad, it proposes to fund the development and creation of a \nmarket API [https://github.com/particl/particl-market] (Particl V3)\ndocumentation. This proposal seeks to help anyone set up a market node and use\nit just like DeMarkets.io did with the explorer for Particl V2.\n\nThe requested donations are on the low end (1,200 PART), so if you’d like to\ncontribute, check out the proposal on the CCS here [https://ccs.particl.io/].\n\n> Note: The Particl node of the CCS will be updated next week, after which\nprevious proposals will be updated. This will also move this proposal from the\nIdea stage into the Funding Required stage.\nParticl Ends 2020 Strongly in Global Github Commit Rankings\nCryptoMiso - Ranking cryptocurrencies based on Github commitsCryptoMiso is a\nweb\nservice ranking cryptocurrencies based on the commit history of their most\npopular Github repository.CryptoMisoBart Claeys [https://www.cryptomiso.com/]The\nYear 2020 has been a different one than previous years for the Particl project.\nThis is primarily because Particl kept most of its development in private\nrepositories as the team was working on the Particl V3 massive update. This\nmeant that only a tiny percentage of the progress was able to be publicly\ntracked on Github. Regardless, being a Bitcoin fork has many benefits for\nParticl, an obvious one being that it effectively leverages the entire\ndevelopment community of Bitcoin.\n\nIn fact, Particl Core Developer Tecnovert constantly keeps the Particl code\nup-to-date with Bitcoin’s codebase. That means regularly pulling Bitcoin\nupdates, modifying the code to make it Particl compatible, and merging it\nwithout breaking anything else. This is obviously no small task, and this is\nreflected in CryptoMiso’s yearly Github commit leaderboard (2020), where Particl\nranked 4th in terms of the number of commits for the whole year! Particl\ncurrently ranks 5th in the past 12 months, and that doesn’t even take into\naccount the development made to the private repositories of Particl Desktop and\nthe BasicSwap DEX protocol.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Best is Yet to Come\nAlthough Particl is going through an unfortunate situation at this moment, it’s\nalso about to turn it into the best and most productive event since the\ninception of the project itself with the proposed new treasury model.\n\nWe understand that the current times can be challenging, but rest assured that\nthe best is yet to come! The team’s getting ready to fire up the engine full\nsteam ahead once again, scale back up, properly promote the project and its\nproducts, and come back into the midst of action with a strong bang!\n\nIt’s definitive.

Today, we are happy to bring more details and clarity on the situation and explain the way forward.</p><h3 id=\"hardforks-schedule\">Hardforks Schedule</h3><p>To limit the impact of having RingCT and CT transactions disabled any further (such as, for example, the inability to release Particl V3 without it), <strong>the team has opted to adopt a multi-fork approach</strong> instead of a two-fork one, as initially proposed.</p><h3 id=\"next-hardfork\">Next Hardfork</h3><p>The next hardfork, which is expected to go live in April, will re-enable RingCT and CT transactions as well unfreeze the majority of legitimate outputs currently frozen. Once completed, it will also enable the Particl V3 release to go live on mainnet.</p><p>If you want to know all the changes integrated into the second hardfork, please consult its PR on Github by following this link: <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/pull/81\"><strong>https://github.com/particl/particl-core/pull/81</strong></a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/pull/81\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Hf2 by tecnovert · Pull Request #81 · particl/particl-core</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Second fork of exploit fix.

The team is finalizing the portion of the code required to whitelist outputs and undergoing a <strong>full RingCT and CT internal audit</strong> to ensure the code's integrity before going live with the hardfork.</p><p>Additionally, the team is working separately on additional changes related to a treasury model proposal which is detailed a bit further down this update. If the treasury proposal is approved, it’ll be integrated into the code for the next hardfork.</p><h3 id=\"legitimate-outputs-whitelisting-process\">Legitimate Outputs Whitelisting Process</h3><p>Users with legitimate anon or blind balances will be able to unfreeze and move them back to public balances. For the vast majority of users, this will be possible right after the next hardfork goes live but, in some specific cases, a process involving more manual steps will be required. If you fall into that category, your anon and blind balances will be unfrozen in a subsequent hardfork a bit later on after the next one.</p><p>Here are the two methods used to unfreeze legitimate anon and blind balances.</p><ol><li>A “<strong>low pass filter</strong>” will allow any output that contains a number of coins below a certain threshold to be unfrozen. As the attacker generated large outputs on which balance transfers were drawn from, this won’t unfreeze exploited outputs. The exact value of the threshold will be confirmed in a separate blog post coming shortly in the next week or two.</li><li>Users with legitimate balances larger than the low pass filter’s threshold will need to go through a <strong>manual claim process</strong> that will require them to prove the coins' legitimacy. This can be done using various methods. Which method is used will be up to the user. Claims will need to be presented to the community through a CCS proposal (using a template provided by the team) and then be approved through on-chain voting. Once approved, the outputs will be marked as unfrozen as soon as another hardfork goes live later in the year. This process ensures that the entire process remains decentralized and that no single party (in this case, the Particl team) can single-handedly take such a critical decision. More details on this process will also be provided in a separate blog post coming in a week or two on Particl News.</li></ol><p>As this claim process (option 2) requires manual input from users, a long-enough time-frame will be granted to allow everyone that needs to go through it enough time to do so.</p><h3 id=\"adjusted-total-supply-and-implications\">Adjusted Total Supply and Implications</h3><p>One of the consequences of this bug is the inflation of the total supply, which isn’t yet reflected officially by the blockchain. In fact, because of the stealthy nature of the exploit, the total supply that the blockchain displays is the one expected if there never was any inflationary bug. This will be adjusted to its actual value in two different ways.</p><p>First off, <strong>the supply will dynamically adjust itself as users move their legitimate anon and blind outputs through the low pass filter</strong>. Whenever a successful low pass transaction occurs, the blockchain will automatically detect it and adjust its supply accordingly.</p><p>Secondly, <strong>the supply will also be adjusted once the hardfork that whitelists outputs approved by the community through the CCS goes live</strong>. Any new coin being unfrozen through this process will be added to the total Particl supply.</p><p>What this means is that, by the end of the manual claim process, the supply will be fully adjusted to its true value and will display the real, post-inflation supply. The team currently estimates the final number of exploited coins to range between 1.5M and 2M, including the already-confirmed exploited coins (768,767 coins).</p><p>Please take note that this is just a rough estimate based on various information the team has gathered since the first hardfork (holders who’ve contacted the team, evidence on the blockchain, and so on). The actual number may end up being slightly higher, or slightly lower, but should ultimately trend towards those numbers.</p><h3 id=\"other-implications\">Other Implications</h3><p>This inflationary event also bears other implications for the network.</p><ul><li><strong>An increase in staking rewards size</strong> will be observed. In fact, the size of rewards will go up by the same amount as the supply goes up. If, for example, the total supply ends up being inflated by 15%, then staking rewards will also grow in size by an equal 15%. That’s because staking rewards are calculated based on a percentage of the total supply.</li><li>Other projects that had forked Particl’s RingCT protocol were contacted privately and disclosed the vulnerability before the public announcement. The Veil project has been contacted but found not to be vulnerable due to a different implementation. The Ghost project, on the other hand, has been found to be vulnerable but has swiftly patched the vulnerability. We’d like to thank both teams for their support and urgency in addressing the situation.</li></ul><h1 id=\"particl-v3-update\">Particl V3 Update</h1><p>It can be reported that a significant slow down has been observed in the finalization of Particl V3 in the past few weeks due to personal issues that led to a strain in time availability. This is in the process of being resolved and we expect the development of Particl V3 and Particl Desktop to resume at its usual pace (and, more likely, at a faster pace than it used to) in the next few days.</p><p>For this reason, we do not have any specific update on Particl V3 for the moment, but we fully expect to have a report ready to go live before the next Project Update in April. We also expect the new testnet version to go live before that time.</p><p>To understand a bit more where things are headed for Particl and how the project is about to get back full steam ahead, carefully read the next section.</p><h1 id=\"a-proposal-for-an-improved-and-more-sustainable-treasury-model\">A Proposal for an Improved and More Sustainable Treasury Model</h1><p>As <strong><a href=\"https://particl.foundation/foundation-announcement\">it was communicated a few months ago</a></strong>, the Particl Foundation has paid all outstanding payments to its contractors (which includes developers). This necessary action (due to agreed commitments with said contractors) has severely depleted the Foundation’s reserves <strong>leading it to initiate its shutdown process</strong>.</p><p>As a result, the Particl team had to pause salaries until a new funding solution appeared, which caused the project to temporarily go back to a voluntary-based contribution model. This has, unfortunately, led to a considerable reduction in time availability for most of the team members due to other temporary commitments needed to be made to make ends meet.</p><p>Additionally, the looming release of Particl V3, which is arguably the biggest Particl release ever since the project’s inception, is right around the corner with only a few changes needed to be applied for it to go live on mainnet. The problem? The team doesn’t have access to proper funding anymore to promote it at its just value and give it the exposure it deserves. This situation, combined with the voluntary-basis contribution model that is in play, motivated the team to work on a creative but effective solution to get the project funded once again and be back in action full steam ahead.</p><h3 id=\"a-new-and-improved-treasury-model\">A New and Improved Treasury Model</h3><p>For the reasons mentioned above, and to ensure the proper development and effective promotion of the project in the many years to come, <strong>the team has been working relentlessly on a new, more robust treasury model which would guarantee enough funding to support the project</strong>. This would ultimately provide the project with just as much financial support as the project had at its peak and eventually surpass this level.</p><p>The new treasury model being designed doesn’t aim at reinventing the wheel. At current PART prices, self-sustainability can be achieved by tweaking the current treasury model which, at this moment, reserves 10% of all the staking rewards to support the project. The Particl team is modelling the new treasury figures after that of very successful and top-rated projects in the space such as Decred, Siacoin, and others which have adopted similar self-funding strategy. Doing so has proven to be an overwhelming and indisputable success for these projects.</p><h3 id=\"what-to-expect\">What to Expect?</h3><p>While the numbers around the new treasury model are still being simulated and evaluated, this would allow for the <strong>immediate full funding of the Particl team at current PART prices</strong> and would provide enough funds to reserve in various budgets aimed at supporting and promoting the project as well as stimulate user growth.</p><p>As the treasury model is based on PART staking, <strong>an increase in PART prices would directly translate to a more significant source of funding for the project</strong> which could, eventually, be used to expand the team with new members (developers and non-developers), fund campaigns (i.e. marketing, user growth, etc), fund promotional efforts, and fund various budgets such as exchange listings, just as an example. This model has, in fact, exponential potential.</p><p>Of course, before any expansion process beings, the first step is to fire up the engine once again and stabilize the new Particl internal structure. A team expansion is a time-consuming process with various considerations and thus, is planned for when the time will be suitable for it.</p><p>As a result of this new source of funding, you can expect the Particl project to be back in the midst of action and be as strong, and even stronger, as it was at its peak. You can also expect a much faster pace of development, more frequent communication, more transparency, more promotional efforts, more marketing, more user growth/adoption initiatives, and so on. This is the key to ensure Particl’s success not only this year but in the many years that stand ahead of us all.</p><h3 id=\"submitted-as-a-ccs-proposal\">Submitted as a CCS Proposal</h3><p>The team is currently implementing a better UI for the on-chain voting system in the CCS system and it should go live in a week or two. That’ll allow you to better visualize the proposals, current voting, and etc.</p><p>Because this new treasury model changes the values of the yearly staking interest rate as well as the percentage of all staking rewards being reserved for the development and promotion of the Particl project, community consensus has to be achieved at the protocol level to ensure an optimal level of decentralization.</p><p>Another important point is that all the block rewards going to the treasury fund will require an on-chain vote to be spent. <strong>Every quarter, the Particl team will submit a CCS proposal to have its budget approved by the community using on-chain voting</strong>. This ultimately gives the community the final say, furthers the level of decentralization of the project (and its governance), and keeps the team accountable to every PART holder to ensure it always acts in the best interest of the ecosystem.</p><h3 id=\"full-details-coming-in-a-separate-blog-post\">Full Details Coming in a Separate Blog Post</h3><p>Just like with the information surrounding the proposed solutions for the inflationary bug, the precise details, figures, and in-depth information about the treasury model proposal will be posted in a separate blog post that is likely to go out next week on Particl News.

Today, we are happy to bring more details and clarity on the situation and explain the way forward.</p><h3 id=\"hardforks-schedule\">Hardforks Schedule</h3><p>To limit the impact of having RingCT and CT transactions disabled any further (such as, for example, the inability to release Particl V3 without it), <strong>the team has opted to adopt a multi-fork approach</strong> instead of a two-fork one, as initially proposed.</p><h3 id=\"next-hardfork\">Next Hardfork</h3><p>The next hardfork, which is expected to go live in April, will re-enable RingCT and CT transactions as well unfreeze the majority of legitimate outputs currently frozen. Once completed, it will also enable the Particl V3 release to go live on mainnet.</p><p>If you want to know all the changes integrated into the second hardfork, please consult its PR on Github by following this link: <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/pull/81\"><strong>https://github.com/particl/particl-core/pull/81</strong></a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/pull/81\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Hf2 by tecnovert · Pull Request #81 · particl/particl-core</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Second fork of exploit fix.

The team is finalizing the portion of the code required to whitelist outputs and undergoing a <strong>full RingCT and CT internal audit</strong> to ensure the code's integrity before going live with the hardfork.</p><p>Additionally, the team is working separately on additional changes related to a treasury model proposal which is detailed a bit further down this update. If the treasury proposal is approved, it’ll be integrated into the code for the next hardfork.</p><h3 id=\"legitimate-outputs-whitelisting-process\">Legitimate Outputs Whitelisting Process</h3><p>Users with legitimate anon or blind balances will be able to unfreeze and move them back to public balances. For the vast majority of users, this will be possible right after the next hardfork goes live but, in some specific cases, a process involving more manual steps will be required. If you fall into that category, your anon and blind balances will be unfrozen in a subsequent hardfork a bit later on after the next one.</p><p>Here are the two methods used to unfreeze legitimate anon and blind balances.</p><ol><li>A “<strong>low pass filter</strong>” will allow any output that contains a number of coins below a certain threshold to be unfrozen. As the attacker generated large outputs on which balance transfers were drawn from, this won’t unfreeze exploited outputs. The exact value of the threshold will be confirmed in a separate blog post coming shortly in the next week or two.</li><li>Users with legitimate balances larger than the low pass filter’s threshold will need to go through a <strong>manual claim process</strong> that will require them to prove the coins' legitimacy. This can be done using various methods. Which method is used will be up to the user. Claims will need to be presented to the community through a CCS proposal (using a template provided by the team) and then be approved through on-chain voting. Once approved, the outputs will be marked as unfrozen as soon as another hardfork goes live later in the year. This process ensures that the entire process remains decentralized and that no single party (in this case, the Particl team) can single-handedly take such a critical decision. More details on this process will also be provided in a separate blog post coming in a week or two on Particl News.</li></ol><p>As this claim process (option 2) requires manual input from users, a long-enough time-frame will be granted to allow everyone that needs to go through it enough time to do so.</p><h3 id=\"adjusted-total-supply-and-implications\">Adjusted Total Supply and Implications</h3><p>One of the consequences of this bug is the inflation of the total supply, which isn’t yet reflected officially by the blockchain. In fact, because of the stealthy nature of the exploit, the total supply that the blockchain displays is the one expected if there never was any inflationary bug. This will be adjusted to its actual value in two different ways.</p><p>First off, <strong>the supply will dynamically adjust itself as users move their legitimate anon and blind outputs through the low pass filter</strong>. Whenever a successful low pass transaction occurs, the blockchain will automatically detect it and adjust its supply accordingly.</p><p>Secondly, <strong>the supply will also be adjusted once the hardfork that whitelists outputs approved by the community through the CCS goes live</strong>. Any new coin being unfrozen through this process will be added to the total Particl supply.</p><p>What this means is that, by the end of the manual claim process, the supply will be fully adjusted to its true value and will display the real, post-inflation supply. The team currently estimates the final number of exploited coins to range between 1.5M and 2M, including the already-confirmed exploited coins (768,767 coins).</p><p>Please take note that this is just a rough estimate based on various information the team has gathered since the first hardfork (holders who’ve contacted the team, evidence on the blockchain, and so on). The actual number may end up being slightly higher, or slightly lower, but should ultimately trend towards those numbers.</p><h3 id=\"other-implications\">Other Implications</h3><p>This inflationary event also bears other implications for the network.</p><ul><li><strong>An increase in staking rewards size</strong> will be observed. In fact, the size of rewards will go up by the same amount as the supply goes up. If, for example, the total supply ends up being inflated by 15%, then staking rewards will also grow in size by an equal 15%. That’s because staking rewards are calculated based on a percentage of the total supply.</li><li>Other projects that had forked Particl’s RingCT protocol were contacted privately and disclosed the vulnerability before the public announcement. The Veil project has been contacted but found not to be vulnerable due to a different implementation. The Ghost project, on the other hand, has been found to be vulnerable but has swiftly patched the vulnerability. We’d like to thank both teams for their support and urgency in addressing the situation.</li></ul><h1 id=\"particl-v3-update\">Particl V3 Update</h1><p>It can be reported that a significant slow down has been observed in the finalization of Particl V3 in the past few weeks due to personal issues that led to a strain in time availability. This is in the process of being resolved and we expect the development of Particl V3 and Particl Desktop to resume at its usual pace (and, more likely, at a faster pace than it used to) in the next few days.</p><p>For this reason, we do not have any specific update on Particl V3 for the moment, but we fully expect to have a report ready to go live before the next Project Update in April. We also expect the new testnet version to go live before that time.</p><p>To understand a bit more where things are headed for Particl and how the project is about to get back full steam ahead, carefully read the next section.</p><h1 id=\"a-proposal-for-an-improved-and-more-sustainable-treasury-model\">A Proposal for an Improved and More Sustainable Treasury Model</h1><p>As <strong><a href=\"https://particl.foundation/foundation-announcement\">it was communicated a few months ago</a></strong>, the Particl Foundation has paid all outstanding payments to its contractors (which includes developers). This necessary action (due to agreed commitments with said contractors) has severely depleted the Foundation’s reserves <strong>leading it to initiate its shutdown process</strong>.</p><p>As a result, the Particl team had to pause salaries until a new funding solution appeared, which caused the project to temporarily go back to a voluntary-based contribution model. This has, unfortunately, led to a considerable reduction in time availability for most of the team members due to other temporary commitments needed to be made to make ends meet.</p><p>Additionally, the looming release of Particl V3, which is arguably the biggest Particl release ever since the project’s inception, is right around the corner with only a few changes needed to be applied for it to go live on mainnet. The problem? The team doesn’t have access to proper funding anymore to promote it at its just value and give it the exposure it deserves. This situation, combined with the voluntary-basis contribution model that is in play, motivated the team to work on a creative but effective solution to get the project funded once again and be back in action full steam ahead.</p><h3 id=\"a-new-and-improved-treasury-model\">A New and Improved Treasury Model</h3><p>For the reasons mentioned above, and to ensure the proper development and effective promotion of the project in the many years to come, <strong>the team has been working relentlessly on a new, more robust treasury model which would guarantee enough funding to support the project</strong>. This would ultimately provide the project with just as much financial support as the project had at its peak and eventually surpass this level.</p><p>The new treasury model being designed doesn’t aim at reinventing the wheel. At current PART prices, self-sustainability can be achieved by tweaking the current treasury model which, at this moment, reserves 10% of all the staking rewards to support the project. The Particl team is modelling the new treasury figures after that of very successful and top-rated projects in the space such as Decred, Siacoin, and others which have adopted similar self-funding strategy. Doing so has proven to be an overwhelming and indisputable success for these projects.</p><h3 id=\"what-to-expect\">What to Expect?</h3><p>While the numbers around the new treasury model are still being simulated and evaluated, this would allow for the <strong>immediate full funding of the Particl team at current PART prices</strong> and would provide enough funds to reserve in various budgets aimed at supporting and promoting the project as well as stimulate user growth.</p><p>As the treasury model is based on PART staking, <strong>an increase in PART prices would directly translate to a more significant source of funding for the project</strong> which could, eventually, be used to expand the team with new members (developers and non-developers), fund campaigns (i.e. marketing, user growth, etc), fund promotional efforts, and fund various budgets such as exchange listings, just as an example. This model has, in fact, exponential potential.</p><p>Of course, before any expansion process beings, the first step is to fire up the engine once again and stabilize the new Particl internal structure. A team expansion is a time-consuming process with various considerations and thus, is planned for when the time will be suitable for it.</p><p>As a result of this new source of funding, you can expect the Particl project to be back in the midst of action and be as strong, and even stronger, as it was at its peak. You can also expect a much faster pace of development, more frequent communication, more transparency, more promotional efforts, more marketing, more user growth/adoption initiatives, and so on. This is the key to ensure Particl’s success not only this year but in the many years that stand ahead of us all.</p><h3 id=\"submitted-as-a-ccs-proposal\">Submitted as a CCS Proposal</h3><p>The team is currently implementing a better UI for the on-chain voting system in the CCS system and it should go live in a week or two. That’ll allow you to better visualize the proposals, current voting, and etc.</p><p>Because this new treasury model changes the values of the yearly staking interest rate as well as the percentage of all staking rewards being reserved for the development and promotion of the Particl project, community consensus has to be achieved at the protocol level to ensure an optimal level of decentralization.</p><p>Another important point is that all the block rewards going to the treasury fund will require an on-chain vote to be spent. <strong>Every quarter, the Particl team will submit a CCS proposal to have its budget approved by the community using on-chain voting</strong>. This ultimately gives the community the final say, furthers the level of decentralization of the project (and its governance), and keeps the team accountable to every PART holder to ensure it always acts in the best interest of the ecosystem.</p><h3 id=\"full-details-coming-in-a-separate-blog-post\">Full Details Coming in a Separate Blog Post</h3><p>Just like with the information surrounding the proposed solutions for the inflationary bug, the precise details, figures, and in-depth information about the treasury model proposal will be posted in a separate blog post that is likely to go out next week on Particl News. Stay tuned as the team is in the process of finalizing all the details!</p><h1 id=\"atomic-swaps-are-coming-to-particl-desktop\">Atomic Swaps are Coming to Particl Desktop</h1><p>But wait, there’s more being worked on! Over the past few months, a great surprise has been cooking up and is now ready to be revealed; <strong>atomic swaps are coming right to Particl Desktop</strong> thanks to a new Particl-based distributed exchange protocol.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/iCZmpgHaL6wdVopywgrA_bOSf9iZZc4X44sMLN2psut7LLsa9cFSySY9YTCRz-FHD5NWrorngtzk-gxtg6UzUwHz3c_wKfRa7PGOm9YhOju54KDzDI9OumaLuFx4J8ibTlteZFcS\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><em>Early Design of the BasicSwap-Powered Swap Module on Particl V3 (WIP)</em></figcaption></figure><p>In fact, Particl Core Developer Tecnovert has been working on <em>BasicSwap</em>, an <strong>anonymous DEX protocol that uses SMSG to allow people to swap, without any third-party, cryptocurrencies using atomic swaps</strong>. BasicSwap is currently functional and is in its Closed Beta phase where various testers have been experimenting with it for a few weeks. This anonymous DEX protocol, which <strong>currently supports Particl, Monero, Bitcoin, and Litecoin</strong>, has many benefits that will go a long way in making PART and other cryptocurrencies more resilient and widely accessible to all.</p><p>It uses Particl’s SMSG P2P network and the atomic swap protocol to allow you to exchange cryptocurrencies without requiring a third-party or wrapped assets. The swaps are pretty fast; in fact, swapping PART for LTC averages 20 to 25 minutes per swap (after both transactions are fully confirmed), which is also the same for PART/XMR swaps. Of course, the actual time required for a swap to fully complete is entirely dependent on the confirmation times of the two coins being traded.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/R4iVnjkuTJLCC2feoqXc4qtc6MrJpVLqN3ELXtJBo1GmQT_2zwR7LvAY6I4fZ-NmL2-dryqYKYq2vgstKhLr556aAxr1w-6nqQEkb_NwStpaFphMoPORWRLcuzpfRj-EFwKsKQ8x\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><em>Completed Mainnet Swaps Using the BasicSwap Back-End (Mainnet)</em></figcaption></figure><p>To make it as easy to use as possible, <strong>the BasicSwap protocol will eventually be integrated into the user interface of Particl Desktop</strong>. Swapping cryptocurrencies will be possible through a new Particl V3 “Swap” module and won’t require the syncing of other coin nodes.</p><p>This new atomic swap module isn’t planned to be released with the initial mainnet launch of Particl V3 but is expected to go live in one of the subsequent few Particl Desktop updates that come after it. Even though this project is currently being delayed due to the commitment required from Particl Core Developer Tecnovert to fix the inflationary bug, BasicSwap is fully expected to be accelerated by the potential funding provided by the new treasury model.</p><p>Keep an eye out for an announcement of an Open Beta as well as more information about this tool as soon as the Particl developers can get back to working on their previous tasks after the inflationary bug is dealt with. That should come shortly after the release of Particl V3 on mainnet.</p><h1 id=\"new-ccs-proposal\">New CCS Proposal</h1><p>A few weeks ago, a new proposal was added to the CCS system. Authored by Particl community member ffmad, it proposes to fund the development and creation of a <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-market\">market API</a> (Particl V3) documentation. This proposal seeks to help anyone set up a market node and use it just like DeMarkets.io did with the explorer for Particl V2.</p><p>The requested donations are on the low end (1,200 PART), so if you’d like to contribute, check out the proposal on the CCS <strong><a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io/\">here</a>.</strong></p><blockquote><em><strong>Note: </strong>The Particl node of the CCS will be updated next week, after which previous proposals will be updated. This will also move this proposal from the Idea stage into the Funding Required stage.</em></blockquote><h1 id=\"particl-ends-2020-strongly-in-global-github-commit-rankings\">Particl Ends 2020 Strongly in Global Github Commit Rankings</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://www.cryptomiso.com/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">CryptoMiso - Ranking cryptocurrencies based on Github commits</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">CryptoMiso is a web service ranking cryptocurrencies based on the commit history of their most popular Github repository.</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">CryptoMiso</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">Bart Claeys</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://www.cryptomiso.com/assets/miso_fbshare.png\"></div></a></figure><p>The Year 2020 has been a different one than previous years for the Particl project. This is primarily because Particl kept most of its development in private repositories as the team was working on the Particl V3 massive update. This meant that only a tiny percentage of the progress was able to be publicly tracked on Github. Regardless, being a Bitcoin fork has many benefits for Particl, an obvious one being that it effectively leverages the entire development community of Bitcoin.</p><p>In fact, Particl Core Developer Tecnovert constantly keeps the Particl code up-to-date with Bitcoin’s codebase. That means regularly pulling Bitcoin updates, modifying the code to make it Particl compatible, and merging it without breaking anything else. This is obviously no small task, and this is reflected in CryptoMiso’s yearly Github commit leaderboard (2020), where Particl ranked 4th in terms of the number of commits for the whole year! Particl currently ranks 5th in the past 12 months, and that doesn’t even take into account the development made to the private repositories of Particl Desktop and the BasicSwap DEX protocol.</p><hr><h1 id=\"the-best-is-yet-to-come\">The Best is Yet to Come</h1><p>Although Particl is going through an unfortunate situation at this moment, it’s also about to turn it into the best and most productive event since the inception of the project itself with the proposed new treasury model.</p><p>We understand that the current times can be challenging, but rest assured that the best is yet to come! The team’s getting ready to fire up the engine full steam ahead once again, scale back up, properly promote the project and its products, and come back into the midst of action with a strong bang!</p><p>It’s definitive. Things are looking very good in 2021 and the many years that come after it!

been updated.\nAs you are probably aware, the Particl team has proceeded with an emergency\nhardfork on Thursday the 25th of February, 2021, that temporarily disabled\nRingCT and CT transactions to fix a critical vulnerability in the code. This\nannouncement will disclose the nature of the vulnerability and provide\npreliminary details surrounding the event.\n\nEmergency Hard Fork AnnouncementThe Particl team has found a critical issue in\nthe RingCT and CT code which requires a hardfork. Please update your Particl\nCore nodes immediately.cryptoguardBlog\n[https://particl.news/emergency-hardfork-announcement/]Above all, if you haven’t\nalready done so, please urgently download the new Particl Core (Particl Core\n0.19.2.5 [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.5])\nclient which can be found here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.5]. If you run a\ncold staking node, please update it immediately by typing the partyman update \ncommand. If you use the Particl Desktop client, launch it as soon as possible so\nthat it can automatically be updated with the new Particl Core version. If it's\nalready opened up, please shut it down completely and restart it.\n\n> Note: Trading on exchanges will be safe to resume after updating their nodes to\nParticl Core 0.19.2.5.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Contents\n * What Happened?\n * How Did This Happen?\n * The Solution\n * Investigating the Attack\n * FAQ and our Commitment to Transparency\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat Happened?\nOn the 20th of February, 2021, a significant discrepancy between the expected\nand real supply of Particl was observed and confirmed. This prompted the team to\nhastily look into the source of this discrepancy, which led to the discovery of\na critical vulnerability that allowed coins to be anonymously created by\ndefeating the verification code of plain-to-anon transactions. It can be\nconfirmed that this vulnerability has been exploited by a malicious party which\nled to the creation of an unknown number of anon coins. It can also be confirmed\nthat at least 768,767 exploited PART coins have been successfully transferred\nfrom anon to public balances since the beginning of the attack, according to\ntraces on the blockchain.\n\nThe vulnerability is now fully fixed and cannot be exploited anymore as of the\nrelease of Particl Core 0.19.2.4.\n\nHow Did This Happen?\nUnderstanding the vulnerability requires one to be aware of the two issues in\nthe code which led to it.\n\nThe first and main issue is located in the verification code of plain-to-anon\ntransactions. It caused the commitment sum not to verify when sending coins from\npublic balances to anon ones. This means an attacker can pick his own made-up\noutput values, which aren’t required to sum to the amount of the inputs used.\nThis vulnerability was located here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/cb12ae91f6a84df44e2aa0e73780fee5085491ac/src/consensus/tx_verify.cpp#L342] \nin Particl’s code and has now been patched.\n\nAdditionally, a related issue was discovered that prevented the blind sum from\nbeing set when sending PART coins from public to anon balances. This means that\nall public to anon values would fail the commitment sum check even if their\ninputs and outputs summed. For this reason, it isn't easy to determine, with\nabsolute certainty, which RingCT transactions were exploited and which ones are\nlegitimate. In this case, any anon output or blinded output descending from an\nanon output could, in theory, be holding millions of illegitimate PART coins.\nThis vulnerability is located here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/cb12ae91f6a84df44e2aa0e73780fee5085491ac/src/wallet/hdwallet.cpp#L3836] \nin Particl’s code and has been patched as well.\n\nAt the time of this writing, and since July 2019, it is confirmed that at least\n768,767 exploited PART coins have been successfully transferred from anon\nbalances to public ones. As per the nature of the RingCT privacy protocol, it is\nunclear exactly how many anon coins were created in total or remain in anon\noutputs. Still, the Particl team is continuing its investigation. Any additional\ncoin added to this estimate would be the total number of legitimate PART coins\nthe community holds in anon balances.\n\nBe assured; the Particl team is in the process of determining the new supply and\npreventing any remaining exploited coins from being transacted. Once the\ninvestigation concludes, the total circulating supply of Particl will be\nadjusted to its new, post-inflationary bug value with full certainty,\neffectively restoring the chain’s integrity.\n\n> Note: Although the protocol, cryptography, and libraries of the RingCT and\nBulletproofs protocols have been thoroughly audited by the renowned Quarkslab\nsecurity firm, the specific portion of the code that was exploited, which is its\nimplementation, didn’t fall under the scope of their audit or mandate.\nThe Solution\nThe solution to address this attack and restore the blockchain’s integrity can\nbe separated into two specific objectives.\n\n * Fix the vulnerability to prevent exploited coins from being created and\n   transacted. (SUCCESS)\n * Re-enable anon and blind transactions but permanently block exploited anon\n   coins (IN PROGRESS)\n\nTo complete both of these objectives, the Particl team has pushed forward a\ncontingency plan that requires two hardforks.\n\nHardfork 1\nThe first hardfork, which has been successful already, fixed the vulnerabilities\nto prevent more coins from being created. It also temporarily disabled RingCT\nand CT transactions on the Particl network, preventing anon and blind coins from\nbeing transacted. This made it impossible for the attacker to convert more\nexploited anon coins into public balances, effectively putting a full stop to\nthe attack.\n\nThe new client to make this hardfork happen (Particl Core 0.19.2.4\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.4]) has already\nbeen pushed out publicly, but a new version (Particl Core 0.19.2.5\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.5]) has been\nreleased a few days after. Particl Core 0.19.2.5 introduces a checksum mark\npreventing any rollbacks and permanently invalidating the old chain to get ready\nfor the second hardfork.\n\nIf you haven't updated yet, it is essential that you immediately do so by\ninstalling the new Particl Core version\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.5] or, at the very\nleast, the 0.19.2.4 version.\n\nHardfork 2\nThe second hardfork aims at restoring full RingCT and CT functionalities as well\nas restoring the integrity of the chain by disallowing exploited anon outputs\nfrom being used in the future but allowing legitimate ones. The conclusion of\nthe second hardfork will also confirm the newly adjusted supply of the Particl\nblockchain and adjust it to its true post-inflation value.\n\nOnce this hardfork is completed, it will let you privately transact with other\npeople once again, including when using the Particl Marketplace. To ensure that\nno exploited coins can be used post-hardfork, all the anon and blind outputs\noriginating from before the hardfork will be frozen. It’ll then be possible for\nlegitimate users to unfreeze them by going through a series of manual steps to\nprove their legitimacy.\n\nThe Particl team is currently evaluating various strategies to “whitelist” these\nlegitimate outputs while keeping exploited ones unusable. These strategies vary\nin impact, intrusiveness, and level of complexities, but each has its pros and\ncons.\n\nWhile they are not yet ready to be announced, the team will present to the\ncommunity its game plan as soon as possible. We would like to request additional\ntime to ensure all the necessary data is collected and that the strategies are\nas efficient as they can be. Thank you for your patience and support!\n\n> Note: The second hardfork will also include a few other minor improvements and\nchanges the team had been looking into adding for a while now, some being\nunrelated to this particular exploit event. The full changelog will be available\non the new client’s Github release page.\n> Note 2: The second hardfork will reveal the new inflated supply of the Particl\nblockchain. As a side effect, please take note that this will cause staking\nrewards to increase proportionally to how much the circulating supply has\ninflated.\nInvestigating the Attack\nSince the day of the hardfork, the Particl team has been collecting data and\ncollaborating with exchanges to determine whether the attacker can be identified\nand whether he still holds coins on there. However, due to the nature of RingCT,\nit may be impossible, with total certainty, to come to definitive conclusions.\nIn any case, the investigation continues, but the findings can not yet be\ndisclosed publicly. We will keep you informed as soon as possible.\n\nIf you believe that you’ve tracked suspicious activity on the blockchain, you\ncan submit your findings to Cryptoguard, which will then relay the information\nto the rest of the team for the investigation. We appreciate every bit of help\nand would like to thank everyone who participates in this effort.\n\n> Note: Trading on exchanges will be safe to resume after updating their nodes to\nParticl Core 0.19.2.5.\nFAQ and our Commitment to Transparency\nWe understand that you may have questions related to this announcement; we are\nhere to help! The Particl team is committed to full transparency and user\nsupport through this evolving situation. \n\nTo that end, we will publish a follow-up blog post later on that will contain\nmore data and up-to-date information about the attack as we gather it.\n\nFrom that point, the team will then hold an FAQ session on our sub-Reddit to\nanswer any remaining questions. Cryptoguard will be available for answers with\nsupport from the Particl Core developers. This thread will be pinned on\nParticl's sub-Reddit and serve as the go-to FAQ resource for people with\nquestions about this event.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank You!\nWe want to thank you for your support and patience as we work on collecting more\ndata, preparing for the second hardfork, and building the tools required to\nvalidate legitimate anon outputs. As this is an evolving situation, the Particl\nteam will keep you informed as more information is gathered, so keep an eye out\nfor any new blog post on Particl News!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This prompted the team to hastily look into the source of this discrepancy, which led to the discovery of a critical vulnerability that allowed coins to be anonymously created by defeating the verification code of plain-to-anon transactions. It can be confirmed that this vulnerability has been exploited by a malicious party which led to the creation of an unknown number of anon coins. <strong>It can also be confirmed that at least 768,767 exploited PART coins have been successfully transferred from anon to public balances since the beginning of the attack</strong>, according to traces on the blockchain.</p><p>The vulnerability is now fully fixed and cannot be exploited anymore as of the release of Particl Core 0.19.2.4.</p><h1 id=\"how-did-this-happen\">How Did This Happen?</h1><p>Understanding the vulnerability requires one to be aware of the two issues in the code which led to it.</p><p>The first and main issue is located in the verification code of plain-to-anon transactions. <strong>It caused the commitment sum not to verify when sending coins from public balances to anon ones</strong>. This means an attacker can pick his own made-up output values, which aren’t required to sum to the amount of the inputs used. This vulnerability was located <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/cb12ae91f6a84df44e2aa0e73780fee5085491ac/src/consensus/tx_verify.cpp#L342\"><strong>here</strong></a> in Particl’s code and has now been patched.</p><p>Additionally, a related issue was discovered that <strong>prevented the blind sum from being set when sending PART coins from public to anon balances</strong>. This means that all public to anon values would fail the commitment sum check even if their inputs and outputs summed. For this reason, it isn't easy to determine, with absolute certainty, which RingCT transactions were exploited and which ones are legitimate. In this case, any anon output or blinded output descending from an anon output could, in theory, be holding millions of illegitimate PART coins. This vulnerability is located <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/cb12ae91f6a84df44e2aa0e73780fee5085491ac/src/wallet/hdwallet.cpp#L3836\"><strong>here</strong></a> in Particl’s code and has been patched as well.</p><p>At the time of this writing, and since July 2019, it is confirmed that <strong>at least 768,767 exploited PART coins have been successfully transferred from anon balances to public ones</strong>. As per the nature of the RingCT privacy protocol, it is unclear exactly how many anon coins were created in total or remain in anon outputs. Still, the Particl team is continuing its investigation. <strong><strong>Any additional coin added to this estimate would be the total number of</strong> legitimate<strong> PART coins the community holds in anon balances.</strong></strong></p><p>Be assured; the Particl team is in the process of determining the new supply and preventing any remaining exploited coins from being transacted. Once the investigation concludes, the total circulating supply of Particl will be adjusted to its new, post-inflationary bug value with full certainty, effectively restoring the chain’s integrity.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> Although the protocol, cryptography, and libraries of the RingCT and Bulletproofs protocols have been thoroughly audited by the renowned Quarkslab security firm, the specific portion of the code that was exploited, which is its implementation, didn’t fall under the scope of their audit or mandate.</em></blockquote><h1 id=\"the-solution\">The Solution</h1><p>The solution to address this attack and restore the blockchain’s integrity can be separated into two specific objectives.</p><ul><li>Fix the vulnerability to prevent exploited coins from being created and transacted. (SUCCESS)</li><li>Re-enable anon and blind transactions but permanently block exploited anon coins (IN PROGRESS)</li></ul><p>To complete both of these objectives, the Particl team has pushed forward a contingency plan that requires two hardforks.</p><h3 id=\"hardfork-1\">Hardfork 1</h3><p>The first hardfork, which has been successful already, <strong>fixed the vulnerabilities to prevent more coins from being created. It also temporarily disabled RingCT and CT transactions</strong> on the Particl network, preventing anon and blind coins from being transacted. This made it impossible for the attacker to convert more exploited anon coins into public balances, effectively putting a full stop to the attack.</p><p>The new client to make this hardfork happen (<strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.4\">Particl Core 0.19.2.4</a></strong>) has already been pushed out publicly, but a new version (<strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.5\">Particl Core 0.19.2.5</a></strong>) has been released a few days after. Particl Core 0.19.2.5 introduces a checksum mark preventing any rollbacks and permanently invalidating the old chain to get ready for the second hardfork.</p><p>If you haven't updated yet, it is essential that you immediately do so by installing <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.5\"><strong>the new Particl Core version</strong></a><strong> </strong>or, at the very least, the 0.19.2.4 version.</p><h3 id=\"hardfork-2\">Hardfork 2</h3><p>The second hardfork aims at <strong>restoring full RingCT and CT functionalities</strong> as well as restoring the integrity of the chain by <strong>disallowing exploited anon outputs from being used in the future but allowing legitimate ones</strong>. The conclusion of the second hardfork will also confirm the newly adjusted supply of the Particl blockchain and adjust it to its true post-inflation value.</p><p>Once this hardfork is completed, it will let you privately transact with other people once again, including when using the Particl Marketplace. To ensure that no exploited coins can be used post-hardfork, all the anon and blind outputs originating from before the hardfork will be frozen. It’ll then be possible for legitimate users to unfreeze them by going through a series of manual steps to prove their legitimacy.</p><p>The Particl team is currently evaluating various strategies to “whitelist” these legitimate outputs while keeping exploited ones unusable. These strategies vary in impact, intrusiveness, and level of complexities, but each has its pros and cons.</p><p>While they are not yet ready to be announced, the team will present to the community its game plan as soon as possible. We would like to request additional time to ensure all the necessary data is collected and that the strategies are as efficient as they can be. Thank you for your patience and support!</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> The second hardfork will also include a few other minor improvements and changes the team had been looking into adding for a while now, some being unrelated to this particular exploit event. The full changelog will be available on the new client’s Github release page.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em><strong>Note 2:</strong> The second hardfork will reveal the new inflated supply of the Particl blockchain. As a side effect, please take note that this will cause staking rewards to increase proportionally to how much the circulating supply has inflated.</em></blockquote><h1 id=\"investigating-the-attack\">Investigating the Attack</h1><p>Since the day of the hardfork, the Particl team has been collecting data and collaborating with exchanges to determine whether the attacker can be identified and whether he still holds coins on there. However, due to the nature of RingCT, it may be impossible, with total certainty, to come to definitive conclusions. In any case, the investigation continues, but the findings can not yet be disclosed publicly. We will keep you informed as soon as possible.</p><p>If you believe that you’ve tracked suspicious activity on the blockchain, you can submit your findings to Cryptoguard, which will then relay the information to the rest of the team for the investigation.

Although there isn’t a ton of new stuff to report,\npartly due to a well-deserved break the developers took during the holidays,\ngood progress has been made on several fronts.\n\nLet’s get down to the details of it!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNew Particl Core Releases\nAs mentioned recently, Particl Core developer Tecnovert has been ramping up\ndevelopment in various areas, notably in keeping Particl Core up-to-date with\nBitcoin’s codebase. As we walk through 2021, you can expect core elements and\nupdates to be more frequent than they have been in the past year or so.\n\nTo that end, two new core releases were published as pre-releases this month;\nParticl Core 0.19.2.3 and Particl Core 0.21.0.1.\n\nToday, on the 28th of January, 2021, Particl Core 0.19.2.3 has been fully\nreleased [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.3] and\nhas exited its pre-release phase.\n\nParticl Core 0.19.2.3\n * Download: https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.3\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.3]\n\nThe new Particl Core 0.19.2.3 full release is mostly composed of minor bug fixes\nand improvements. It also re-introduces 32bit builds for Windows, which has now\nbeen abandoned by Bitcoin, making Particl accessible to an even wider range of\nusers across the globe. This lets users with less powerful or more dated\ncomputers access Particl Core and Particl Marketplace in less technically\nequipped environments. The full changelog is as follows:\n\n * Merged Bitcoin 0.19.2 backports.\n * New PoW checkpoints.\n * Fix smsginbox hex encoding bug.\n * Tighten IsStandard() check to fail on trailing script.\n * Re-enable win32 gitian build.\n\nParticl Core 0.21.0.1\n * Download: https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.0.1\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.0.1]\n\nThe Particl Core 0.21.0.1 is a much bigger release compared to the 0.19.2.3 one.\nIt’s the first significant core update since the 4th of December, 2019, and it\nincludes a vast number of improvements derived from Bitcoin Core 0.20 and 0.21.\nHere are some of the most noteworthy.\n\n * New RPC call to easily create and share a secure blockchain snapshot that\n   allows you to start using the blockchain while it hasn’t fully synced yet.\n * Asmap functionality\n   [https://cryptooof.com/bitcoin-core-brings-asmap-as-an-antidote-to-erebus-attack/] \n   for more reliable and decentralized network connectivity.\n * Tor V3 support\n   [https://decrypt.co/44640/bitcoins-next-upgrade-will-support-tor-v3-addresses] \n   for better network privacy. Tor will deprecate V2 addresses in the next year\n   or two, making this a critical update to Particl Core.\n * Schnorr signatures\n   [https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/the-power-of-schnorr-the-signature-algorithm-to-increase-bitcoin-s-scale-and-privacy-1460642496] \n   and Taproot\n   [https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/taproot-coming-what-it-and-how-it-will-benefit-bitcoin] \n   readiness for more privacy and scalability. This has yet to be activated,\n   however, but Particl Core is now ready for it.\n * No default wallet created when launching Particl Core for the first time.\n * “Compact client-side block filtering” for more privacy-friendly light\n   wallets.\n * Various issue and bug fixes as well as general improvements that operate more\n   in the background\n\nParticl Core 0.21.0.1 is published as a pre-release, meaning it still requires a\nmore extensive period of testing across different environments before being\ndeployed as a full release. As has been the tradition with Particl, this is to\nensure the stability and security of this new release. Once it gets fully\nreleased, Particl Core 0.21.0.1 will then supercede Particl Core 0.19.2.3.\n\nIf you find any issue with Particl Core 0.21.0.1, please report them directly to \nParticl’s particl-core Github issue page\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/issues].\n\nParticl V3\nParticl V3, which includes the new Particl Desktop client and the improved\nmarketplace codebase, has progressed well. Here are the current two areas that\nare still being worked on.\n\n * Fixing minor bugs and issues identified by the community during the testing\n   round for the first testnet build.\n * Fixing a more extensive problem related to Windows builds prevents some users\n   from launching the application normally.\n\nAlthough the minor bugs and issues are expected to be fixed quickly, the Windows\nissue is a more complicated one, requiring much more effort. A new testnet build\nof Particl V3 will likely be released very shortly, but it may not yet include\nthe fix for the Windows issue.\n\nThis would give the opportunity to the community to, once again, test out the\nbuild and make sure no new issue has appeared as a result of the various fixes\nthat are being implemented. And then, once the Windows issue is fixed, a new\ntestnet build will be immediately published. If no new problem arises after this\npoint, Particl V3 will then be ready to immediately initiate its move towards\nmainnet.\n\nParticl Academy\nThe Particl Academy is nearing completion and is still scheduled for release\nbefore the Particl V3 mainnet. Take note that, following Particl’s ethos, the\nentire Particl Academy platform will be open-sourced on Github. That’ll allow\nanyone in the community to contribute with content, propose changes, or improve\nany aspect.\n\nCCS System\nThere are two important topics worth mentioning regarding the CCS proposal\nsystem.\n\nFirst off, a major proposal was pushed roughly one month ago and has raised\napproximately 65% of its target with 29 participants contributing! It suggests\nseeding the marketplace with thousands of real items that will be able to be\nanonymously purchased. The entire buying process for these items will be\nautomated, meaning a swift and smooth user experience.\n\nTo support this initiative, please feel free to donate to the proposal by\nfollowing this link\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html].\n\nSeeding Items to the MarketplaceLudx and Cryptoguard\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html]Secondly,\nthe Particl team has started preparing, code-wise and logistically, to integrate\nthe new on-chain voting module into the CCS system. This will let community\nmembers push proposals that may require a consensus to be reached. Such\nproposals can include protocol changes, Community Fund movement, etc.\n\nMore details will be provided shortly about the consensus requirements (what is\nneeded for a proposal to be deemed as “having reached consensus”) as well as the\non-chain voting system in general and its expected time of arrival.\n\nParticl.News Translations\nA while ago, valuable Particl community members started translating key blog\nposts. However, due to the limitative nature of Medium, they couldn’t be\nproperly displayed on Particl.News. This has now changed with Particl’s blog\nmigration from Medium to Ghost.\n\nTranslated articles are now being published on Particl News\n[https://particl.news]! These translated articles do not show up, by default, on\nthe blog’s main page but can be easily accessed by clicking the right language\nflag at the top right corner of the screen.\n\nAs translations are a big part of making Particl accessible to the global\ncommunity, we’d like to thank all these contributors for their hard work in\ntranslating these articles. They are WhiteFlag (Spanish), Laurogripa \n(Portuguese), Mbacoinin and Stock999 (Russian), and Anonymouser (Philippines)!\n\nIf you would like to contribute to Particl and help out translating content into\nyour native language, please reach out on Particl’s Discord server or Telegram\nchannels. We’ll be happy to see with you what content is the most important to\ntranslate and publish your work on Particl News [https://particl.news].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Needs YOU!\nAs we now find ourselves on the verge of going live with the second testing\nround of Particl v3, Particl needs your help! So get your machines ready so that\nwe can all blast through this new testing round ensuring a fast, but secure,\nmigration towards mainnet. \n\nIn the meantime, you can be of crucial help by testing out the new Particl Core\n0.21.0.1 release. Testing it across many different environments (operating\nsystems, hardware setups, etc) helps picking up potential issues more\neffectively and moving forward more effectively.\n\nAs always, the entire Particl team would like to warmly thank you for your\ncontinued support through the years so far. Let's, together, make 2021 a great\nyear for Particl and the world of decentralized e-commerce in general!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

These are the releases of Particl Core 0.19.2.3 (pre-release, mainnet)\nand Particl Core 0.21.0.1 (pre-release, mainnet).\n\nIt is now possible to download these releases by navigating to Particl’s \nparticl-core repository on Github\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases].

It also re-introduces 32bit builds for Windows, which has now\nbeen abandoned by Bitcoin. This lets users with less powerful or more dated\ncomputers run Particl Core without issues. The full changelog is as follows:\n\n * Merged Bitcoin 0.19.2 backports.\n * New checkpoints.\n * Fix smsginbox hex encoding bug.\n * Tighten IsStandard() check to fail on trailing script.\n * Re-enable win32 gitian build.\n\nParticl Core 0.19.2.3 will soon follow with a full release after a more\nextensive period of testing.

It is, nonetheless, available on mainnet and\ncan be used with Particl-Qt and the CLI client. It brings Particl back to par\nwith Bitcoin’s latest version (0.21) and includes all the recent changes made to\nBitcoin’s code since the last update.\n\nAs Bitcoin Core 0.21 has been released a few days ago\n[https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-core-0-21-0-released-whats-new],\nParticl Core 0.21 will soon follow with a full release after a more extensive\nperiod of testing.

For this reason, this is an important update and is\nrecommended for the advanced users who prefer using the more lightweight\nParticl-Qt client. It is also recommended for those using CLI or interacting\ndirectly with the Particl daemon (i.e., if you are working on a Particl\napplication or writing scripts).\n\nNotes on 0.21.0.1:\n * A default wallet is no longer created or loaded.\n * SQLite backed wallets and multi-process binaries are not converted.\n\nYou can download this pre-release directly on Github by following this link.\n\nRelease Particl Core 0.21.0.1 · particl/particl-coreRelease\nNotes:https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/blob/0.21/doc/release-notes-particl.md#02101\nA default wallet is no longer created or loaded.Sqlite backed wallets and\nmultiprocess binari...particlGitHub\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.0.1]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo catch these releases as soon as they go live, you can follow the \nparticl-core\nrepository on Github [https://github.com/particl/particl-core].

We need your help\nto pick bug, issues, and find improvements!\n\nKeep in mind that, due to the large number of core changes this update\nintroduces, this release is incompatible with previous Particl Desktop data like\nlistings, orders, and your previous market database. That means you’ll have to\nreset your Particl-Market/testnet folder so that it works correctly.\n\nFollow this link [https://particl.news/particl-v3-now-available-on-testnet/] to\nget all the instructions on how to install and start Particl V3-testnet.\n\nParticl V3 Released on Testnet | Test Decentralized and Anonymous Marketplace\nParticl V3-testnet has just been released! New decentralized and anonymous\nmarketplace. Buy and sell anything online without leaving a digital footprint.\ncryptoguardParticl News Blog\n[https://particl.news/particl-v3-now-available-on-testnet/]Particl V3\nDevelopment Update\nThroughout December, a Particl V3-testnet build has been released to a limited\nnumber of community members. They have helped a lot testing the new V3 builds\nand identifying bugs and issues.\n\nAs a result, a few minor issues have been picked up, reported, and fixed. None\nof these issues were breaking bugs but rather improvements or quick to fix bugs.\nThe team has been busy preparing the release and making sure that it’s first\npublic testnet release would be as smooth as possible.\n\nTesting Guidelines\nWith Particl V3-testnet live and going, now’s the time to test it out as much as\npossible. The goal here is to try to break it or make it behave unexpectedly. In\nfact, this testing phase is all about finding any edge case that may lead to\nproblems once deployed on mainnet.\n\nTo properly report issues when testing Particl V3-testnet, click the bug icon at\nthe bottom left corner of Particl Desktop and create a Github issue describing,\nin detail, the problem you’ve encountered.\n\nAdditionally, you can join the Particl Community forum’s Marketplace Testing\ncategory [https://particl.community/category/16/marketplace-testing] to discuss\nissues, ask questions, and find other Particl community members to test the\nmarketplace and make test orders.\n\nWork on Atomic Swap Continues\nParticl cryptographer Tecnovert has continued his work on atomic swaps so that\nthey can be integrated into Particl Desktop. This will go a long way in\nimproving PART's accessibility for all, including in the USA, and make the\nParticl platform more resilient to outside influence.\n\nOf course, atomic swaps between Particl and coins like Bitcoin, Litecoin,\nMonero, Decred, and others are already possible, but they're generally\nunintuitive. That’s because atomic swaps need, at least for the moment, to be\nmanually executed. That means two swappers need to manually find each other,\nagree to what currencies they want to exchange, at what rate, and at what time.\nDuring the swap, they also need to manually exchange multiple “swap files”\neither through email, instant messaging, or other means of communication. In\nother words, the process of completing an atomic swap is currently tedious and\nfull of friction.\n\nTo fix those issues, Tecnovert has been working on a solution to fully automate\nall the steps and requirements to make an atomic swap. This solution, which can\nin many ways be likened to a DEX (decentralized exchange), is intended to be\nintegrated into Particl Desktop once it’s ready for deployment.\n\nThat’ll allow anyone, anywhere in the world, to easily buy and sell PART without\nhaving to quit the Particl Desktop client. This integration won’t require any\nthird-party, no account, no KYC, and won’t impose any limitation on the number\nof coins allowed to be traded.\n\nThere is currently no ETA on this item. It’s a pretty complex and bleeding-edge\nchallenge filled with unexpected setbacks and bumps. There is, after all, a\nreason why there are very few DEXes that are 100% decentralized. This is going\nto be a significant area of focus for Tecnovert going into 2021. More details\nwill be shared as we progress further.\n\nParticl.News is now on a Jamstack\nIt’s finally done, Particl.News is now officially hosted on GitHub Pages. The\neditor’s interface is delivered by Ghost (the blog ??), and everything is\nglued together by Gatsby! This new way of hosting the blog provides the project\nwith much more autonomy, a more tailored experience for the audience, easy to\nfind translations, complete control over the website, and zero unnecessary noise\nor third-party branding for you.\n\nIf you’re reading this blog post, then you’re already on the \"Jamstack\"!\n\nThe Particl Academy is About to Go Live\nThe internal testnet builds the team has had for the past few weeks have allowed\na lot of work to be put into the Particl Academy. It’s been completely updated\nwith all the recent information, tutorials, guides, and in-depth articles\nrequired to support the Particl V3 release.\n\nYou can expect the Particl Academy to drop somewhere during the current testing\nphase of Particl V3-testnet and before the mainnet release.\n\nNew CCS Proposal to Support the V3 Mainnet Release\nOn the 3rd of December, a new key proposal has been suggested on the CCS system.\nThis proposal aims at seeding the Particl Marketplace with thousands of listings\nto support the mainnet release of Particl V3.\n\nThis initiative aims to address the chicken and egg problem that each\nmarketplace faces when launching and provide a good base of listings that anyone\ncan buy. Who comes first? The sellers, or the buyers?\n\nThe proposal will also lead to a few Particl Marketplace improvements, such as\nadding a “wanted item” feature, the ability to edit/delete listings once\npublished on the marketplace, and potentially more. These features are not\nnecessarily intended for the mainnet Particl V3 release, but may very well be\npart of the next update after that (Particl Desktop 3.1).\n\nIt is expected that this proposal will move to the Funding Required phase in a\nmatter of days, so if you plan on supporting this initiative, keep your eyes\nopen for an update about it here on Particl.News or directly on CCS System.\n\nTo learn every detail about this proposal and see the community’s questions (and\ntheir corresponding answers), follow this link\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/3].\n\nMarketplace Listing Seeding Proposal by cryptoguard · Pull Request #3 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryFund the development, maintenance, and management\nof\nan automated system to seed Particl Marketplace with thousands of products (and\ntheir reviews) and various storefronts. The initiative a...particlGitHub\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/3]PART Unavailable on Flare\nWallet\nFlare Wallet has recently updated its back-end to use a different block explorer\n(BlockBook) other than Insight. However, due to a few concerns related to this\nback-end switch, the Particl team is currently evaluating whether it wants to\npursue a Flare Wallet listing or not.\n\nFor the moment, we recommend all Particl users to withdraw their PART coins from\nthe wallet while we evaluate the situation. We also recommend deactivating cold\nstaking completely for PART on Flare Wallet if it is already activated.\n\nThe Particl team is in touch with the Flare Wallet team and looking at the\nsituation. We will communicate more information about this at a later time.\n\n> Note: While it’s not possible to withdraw PART on the latest Flare Wallet\nversion, you can download previous builds (i.e., the desktop version of Flare\nWallet) on their website [https://flarewallet.io/] and then proceed with your\nwithdrawal.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat to Expect From Particl Going Into 2021\nParticl V3 is not the end of anything, but rather, the beginning of an exciting\nphase for Particl. Although the Year 2020 has been heavily focused on\ndevelopment and less so on adoption, the Year 2021 will reverse that trend.\n\nWith Particl V3 going live on mainnet, that’ll provide a much more user-friendly\nand powerful decentralized commerce experience to users all across the world and\nwill make user adoption for Particl much easier.\n\nTo that end, the Particl team has been working on, researching, and\nexperimenting with a few concepts, features, and additions to the Particl\necosystem. These aim at fixing some of the issues that Particl still faces when\nit comes to adoption. Here are some additional areas of improvement the Particl\nteam will be focusing energy on in 2021.\n\n * Improve the accessibility of the PART coin and ease the process of buying and\n   selling it.\n * Improve the community marketplace moderation model to be more efficient,\n   scalable, and require less manual input from Particl users.\n * Increase the number of listed items on the Particl Marketplace and increase\n   the on-chain activity (CCS proposal already published).\n * Improve the RingCT anonymity set.\n * Improve the overall scalability of the Particl Marketplace and its underlying\n   protocols to support significantly higher levels of adoption.\n * Reduce the impact of the price volatility of funds while they are being held\n   in escrow.\n\nThese are “some” of the challenges the Particl team will address moving forward\ninto 2021. Although a few of these challenges are already being looked at, the\nfirst step is, of course, to release Particl V3 on mainnet and then assess the\nsituation. How it goes will help determine priorities for 2021 and the post-V3\nphase for the project.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe are very excited to finally draw closer to the mainnet release of Particl V3\nand can’t wait to keep on expanding the Particl ecosystem and improving its\nadoption moving forward into 2021.\n\nDon’t forget to test out Particl V3-testnet all you can and report any bug or\nissue on Github and the Particl Community forum so that it can promptly be fixed\nbefore the “big release”. \n\nThe entire Particl team would like to thank you for your support and wishes you\na very merry Christmas and happy holidays!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

They have helped a lot testing the new V3 builds and identifying bugs and issues.</p><p>As a result, a few minor issues have been picked up, reported, and fixed. None of these issues were breaking bugs but rather improvements or quick to fix bugs. The team has been busy preparing the release and making sure that it’s first public testnet release would be as smooth as possible.</p><h3 id=\"testing-guidelines\"><a href=\"#Testing Guidelines\">Testing Guidelines</a></h3><p>With Particl V3-testnet live and going, now’s the time to test it out as much as possible. The goal here is to try to break it or make it behave unexpectedly. In fact, this testing phase is all about finding any edge case that may lead to problems once deployed on mainnet.</p><p>To properly report issues when testing Particl V3-testnet, click the <strong>bug icon</strong> at the bottom left corner of Particl Desktop and create a Github issue describing, in detail, the problem you’ve encountered.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/12/24-December-2020-09-11-00.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Additionally, you can join the <a href=\"https://particl.community/category/16/marketplace-testing\">Particl Community forum’s Marketplace Testing category</a> to discuss issues, ask questions, and find other Particl community members to test the marketplace and make test orders.</p><h2 id=\"work-on-atomic-swap-continues\">Work on Atomic Swap Continues</h2><p>Particl cryptographer Tecnovert has continued his work on atomic swaps so that they can be integrated into Particl Desktop. This will go a long way in improving PART's accessibility for all, including in the USA, and make the Particl platform more resilient to outside influence.</p><p>Of course, atomic swaps between Particl and coins like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero, Decred, and others are already possible, but they're generally unintuitive. That’s because atomic swaps need, at least for the moment, to be manually executed. That means two swappers need to manually find each other, agree to what currencies they want to exchange, at what rate, and at what time. During the swap, they also need to manually exchange multiple “swap files” either through email, instant messaging, or other means of communication. In other words, the process of completing an atomic swap is currently tedious and full of friction.</p><p>To fix those issues, Tecnovert has been working on a solution to fully automate all the steps and requirements to make an atomic swap. This solution, which can in many ways be likened to a DEX (decentralized exchange), is intended to be integrated into Particl Desktop once it’s ready for deployment.</p><p>That’ll allow anyone, anywhere in the world, to easily buy and sell PART without having to quit the Particl Desktop client. This integration won’t require any third-party, no account, no KYC, and won’t impose any limitation on the number of coins allowed to be traded.<br><br><strong>There is currently no ETA on this item</strong>. It’s a pretty complex and bleeding-edge challenge filled with unexpected setbacks and bumps. There is, after all, a reason why there are very few DEXes that are 100% decentralized. This is going to be a significant area of focus for Tecnovert going into 2021. More details will be shared as we progress further.</p><h2 id=\"particl-news-is-now-on-a-jamstack\">Particl.News is now on a Jamstack</h2><p>It’s finally done, Particl.News is now officially hosted on GitHub Pages. The editor’s interface is delivered by <strong>Ghost</strong> (the blog ??), and everything is glued together by <strong>Gatsby</strong>! This new way of hosting the blog provides the project with much more autonomy, a more tailored experience for the audience, easy to find translations, complete control over the website, and zero unnecessary noise or third-party branding for you.</p><p>If you’re reading this blog post, then you’re already on the \"Jamstack\"!</p><h2 id=\"the-particl-academy-is-about-to-go-live\">The Particl Academy is About to Go Live</h2><p>The internal testnet builds the team has had for the past few weeks have allowed a lot of work to be put into the Particl Academy. It’s been completely updated with all the recent information, tutorials, guides, and in-depth articles required to support the Particl V3 release.<br><br>You can expect the Particl Academy to drop somewhere during the current testing phase of Particl V3-testnet and before the mainnet release.</p><h2 id=\"new-ccs-proposal-to-support-the-v3-mainnet-release\">New CCS Proposal to Support the V3 Mainnet Release</h2><p>On the 3rd of December, a new key proposal has been suggested on the CCS system. This proposal aims at seeding the Particl Marketplace with thousands of listings to support the mainnet release of Particl V3.</p><p>This initiative aims to address the chicken and egg problem that each marketplace faces when launching and provide a good base of listings that anyone can buy. Who comes first? The sellers, or the buyers?<br><br>The proposal will also lead to a few Particl Marketplace improvements, such as adding a “wanted item” feature, the ability to edit/delete listings once published on the marketplace, and potentially more. These features are not necessarily intended for the mainnet Particl V3 release, but may very well be part of the next update after that (Particl Desktop 3.1).</p><p>It is expected that this proposal will move to the Funding Required phase in a matter of days, so if you plan on supporting this initiative, keep your eyes open for an update about it here on Particl.News or directly on CCS System.</p><p>To learn every detail about this proposal and see the community’s questions (and their corresponding answers), follow <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/3\">this link</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/3\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Marketplace Listing Seeding Proposal by cryptoguard · Pull Request #3 · particl/ccs-proposals</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">SummaryFund the development, maintenance, and management of an automated system to seed Particl Marketplace with thousands of products (and their reviews) and various storefronts.

[http://ccs.particl.io] \nhas been live, and there’s been a bit of action with it in the past few days.\nFor this reason, we’ve prepared a small update for the community.\n\nAs a reminder, the Community Crowdfunding System (CCS) is Particl’s brand new\nsystem for the community to push proposals to collect donations from the\ncommunity or pass ideas to a provably fair vote. Proposals can be any community\nproject, initiative, service, or desired feature that may require funding or a\nvote to be initiated.\n\nTo learn about the CCS in more detail, follow this link\n[https://particl.news/new-community-crowdfunding-system-f31f54231982].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe CCS Sees its First Proposal\nRoughly three weeks ago, Particl’s CCS saw its first proposal ever being\npublished by a community member. Please join with the Particl team to\ncongratulate and thank community member Ozandalgali for breaking the ice and\nbeing the first in Particl history to push a proposal on the CCS!\n\nAlthough relatively small in scope, the proposal requests a modest amount of\nPART for the funding of the creation of an explainer GIF to quickly illustrate\nthe concept of Particl’s novel two-party escrow system. Because Particl’s escrow\nsystem is quite different from what most people are used to when shopping or\nselling online (it uses the MAD game-theory instead of a third-party holding\nfunds on behalf of both users), this GIF will be quite helpful to help newcomers\nin understanding how it works.\n\nThis proposal inaugurated the CCS system and has now been pushed to the “Funding\nRequired” phase just a few moments ago. This means that anyone can now donate to\nthe initiative and get it moving. Particl’s Lead Brand Designer and UI/UX Lead\nGerlof van Ek (Crz) has already pledged to create the GIF.\n\nOnce again, thank you, Ozandalgali, for breaking the ice and anchoring yourself\nin Particl’s history!\n\n> To learn more about the proposal, click here\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/mad-escrow-GIF.html].\nA Second CCS Proposal Followed Suite\nJust a few days ago, a second proposal was pushed to the CCS proposal. This\ntime, it was pushed by two Particl team members — Juha Kovanen (Ludx) and\nCryptoguard. This proposal is relatively more extensive in scope than the first\none, and it aims at supporting the release of the groundbreaking and\nlong-anticipated Particl V3 release.\n\nThe proposal suggests funding for developing, deploying, and maintaining an\nautomated system that will list thousands of items on Particl V3, shipped from\nvarious locations. The system will also automatically process orders on Particl,\nreducing the time to move the escrow steps to the bare minimum technically\npossible for the network. This will tremendously reduce the gap (in terms of\nshopping experience) between traditional marketplaces and Particl’s\ndecentralized approach.\n\nThis proposal goes hand in hand with future outreach and user acquisition\nefforts. It is currently in the “idea phase” of the CCS, which means that it is\nstill up for discussion, comments, feedback, and amendment proposals. If you\nwant to partake in the discussion, head over to the proposal’s page and leave a\nreply at the bottom.\n\n> To learn more about the proposal, click here\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/3].\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDecentralizing Particl Even More\nA few weeks ago, it was mentioned in the November Project Update\n[https://particl.news/project-update-26-11-2020-2bdaedb3e96b] that the Particl\nteam has decided to hold off from collecting a salary for their work\nmomentarily. As an alternative, it is likely that a few proposals here and there\nmay be pushed, independently by team members, to the CCS from time to time.\n\nThis new approach increases the project’s community aspect and gives all of its\nmembers much more decisional power. Indeed, the community can now approve or\ndisapprove current and future proposals by either donating or not and letting\ntheir voice be heard. It also gives the community all the tools they need to\ngather support from other members for any idea or project they may have that\ndirectly benefits Particl. No more does everything have to go through the team, \nanyone can now steer this ship that is the Particl project!\n\nYou can now expect a few proposals, sponsored by team members or managed by\nthem, to go live on the CCS. Some of them may involve some team members working\non initiatives, while others may involve third-party contractors or partners\nwith whom the team has developed relationships. There are a few initiatives in\nthe pipeline that should be soon published, and the team is looking forward to\npresenting them to you!\n\nOn-Chain Voting is Coming to the CCS\nThe Particl team has been working on a new on-chain voting system and will be\nintegrating it into the CCS shortly. This will give the system more flexibility\nand allow anyone to push proposals that may require a community vote to move\nforward. This can be, for example, a proposal that suggests a modification to\nParticl Core or another critical aspect of the ecosystem.\n\nThe ability to push proposals that require voting may also be used by anyone in\nthe community to spend, move, or manage the Community Fund’s funds.

lot to report!\nStarting today, Particl development updates will be replaced by monthly project\nupdates to cover a broader range of things that have been happening, are\nhappening, and will be happening to the project as a whole. They will be\npublished at a regular schedule on the fourth Thursday of every month.\n\nToday marks this first such project update, and it’s one that is particularly\nimportant given the load of information contained in this blog post. So without\nfurther ado, let’s dive right into it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Content\n * Tecnovert Update\n   [https://particl.news/project-update-26-11-2020-2bdaedb3e96b#1e4a]\n * Particl V3 Progress\n   [https://particl.news/project-update-26-11-2020-2bdaedb3e96b#283f]\n * In-app Swap Module\n   [https://particl.news/project-update-26-11-2020-2bdaedb3e96b#5b90]\n * Team Update\n   [https://particl.news/project-update-26-11-2020-2bdaedb3e96b#f0b6]\n * CCS System [https://particl.news/project-update-26-11-2020-2bdaedb3e96b#e32e]\n * Revamped Particl Wiki\n   [https://particl.news/project-update-26-11-2020-2bdaedb3e96b#8b14]\n * What’s Coming\n   [https://particl.news/project-update-26-11-2020-2bdaedb3e96b#770c]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDevelopment Update\nTecnovert & Core Update\nAs you know, most of the current development efforts have been focused on\nbringing to life the long-anticipated Particl V3 release. However, Tecnovert,\nParticl’s lead cryptographer, has been working on other stuff in the meantime.\n\nXMR — PART Atomic Swap\ntecnovert/xmrswap\nImplementation of the h4sh3d Bitcoin-Monero Cross-chain Atomic Swap protocol…\ngithub.com\nNot too long ago, he released the xmrswap protocol\n[http://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap] which allows XMR and PART to be exchanged\nvia atomic swaps. For those who don’t know, atomic swaps are contracts of\nexchange and executed between two users without the assistance of any\nthird-party. They are uncensorable, private, and fully decentralized swaps of\nvalue from one cryptocurrency to the other.\n\nParticl Core 0.21.1.0\nHe has also put a lot of work into updating the current Particl Core version\n(0.19) to the latest Bitcoin version (0.21). Since it has been some time since\nthe latest Core update, it’s taken a significant amount of work to complete but\nit was well worth it due to what’s being introduced by it.\n\nOn Monday the 23rd of November, 2020, Tecnovert has finally pre-released Particl\nCore 0.21.1.0 on mainnet. We highly recommend downloading and installing the new\ncore version and testing it out. That’ll provide valuable feedback to Tecnovert\nwhich he’ll be able to use to finish off the release and push it as a full\nrelease.\n\n * Download: https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.1.0rc1\n\nNote: This release re-introduces 32bit builds which have been requested by some\ncommunity members. If you happen to be one of those, please download and test\nthese in your environment and report back to the #Development channel.\n\nTaproot Readiness\nUpgrading to the newest core version of Particl introduces the required code for\nTaproot to make its way onto Particl.\n\nTaproot is a form of transaction based on “MAST”, but with a little tweak, that\nallows you to make a complicated conditional transaction (i.e. atomic swap) look\nlike a typical transaction. In Particl’s case, this new feature is specially\nintended to increase the privacy level of atomic swaps by having them look like\nany other regular transaction to the outside observer. Check this article from\nCoinDesk [https://www.coindesk.com/taproot-merged-bitcoin-core] for more\ninformation about this new protocol improvement.\n\nBlockBook Integration\nParticl’s invaluable core developer Kewde has recently been working on adding\nsupport for Blockbook, a Trezor-compatible block explorer with some extra\nfeatures. The support should be available within the new few days now, watch for\nany Particl.news [https://particl.news/] blog post about it in the coming days.\n\nParticl Marketplace (V3)\nIn reality, there is very little left to do before the V3 release is ready for\npublic testing.\n\n- The V3 market codebase has recently been pushed on Github and is now available\nfor public audit. The codebase is complete with all V3 additions and refactored\ncode in place. You can follow its progress and check out the changes here: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-market/commits/develop\n\n- During the internal round of testing that’s been going for a couple of weeks\nnow, a bunch of new issues related to the Windows build have popped up and\nrequired developers to allocate extra time to them. They have all been resolved\nas of last week, but please be on the lookout for any Windows-related issues\nwhen testing Particl V3 on Windows.\n\n- It was announced two weeks ago that only notifications and comments needed to\nbe completed before the public release of testnet builds. As of today, it can be\nreported that the notifications have been fully completed and are currently\nbeing tested in recent internal builds.\n\n- Some issues have arisen concerning the buyflow integration of comments\n(buyer/seller communication). As the changes required to fix the problem may\ntake some time, the team is exploring releasing the testnet build without this\nportion of the comment feature for now and integrating it either during public\ntestnet or as a V3.1 release.\n\n- Current builds have been tested quite extensively by now. The public testnet\nis expected to go very smoothly and be short in duration before the release can\nmove up onto the mainnet.\n\nIn-app Swap Module\nParticl’s SMSG bot framework has been significantly improved, but the in-app\nswap module still requires a bit of work for it to be completely finished off.\nAdditionally, some of Particl’s swap partners (SimpleSwap, StealthEX, and\nSwapSpace) have been experiencing issues with the PART pair and are actively\nworking on bringing back up.\n\nThe Particl team and these teams have been in constant communication for a while\nnow. The issue is related to Bittrex which has recently changed the terms of how\nthey want to work with swap businesses using their APIs. The exchanges are\nstating that they are working on solutions to bring PART back up on the\nexchanges, but it may take some time.\n\nFor this reason, the in-app swap module may unfortunately not be part of the\ninitial V3 release and may, instead, be pushed to the 3.1 release or whenever\nPART gets back up on these exchanges. Exactly when this happens is yet to be\ndetermined but is partly dependent on factors external to Particl.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTeam Update\nA few weeks ago and effective at that time, the Particl team and Foundation\nmutually agreed to take proactive measures to ensure the continued development\nof the project while at the same time cutting down the costs to the minimum.\n\nCutting Down on the Costs\nAs a result, all salaried Particl team members have agreed to momentarily not\ntake a salary while at the same time pledging to continue the development of the\nproject and its roadmap.\n\nThis is only possible thanks to the passion of each Particl team member and\ntheir commitment to Particl’s mission of a more fair, free, and secure\nenvironment of eCommerce.\n\nWhat does this change?\nIn reality, this won’t change much in the sense that the roadmap will still be\nworked on as planned earlier this year. It does, however, change how the team\nwill approach tackling the roadmap items needed to complete. Here are a few\nexpected changes as a result of this new reality.\n\n 1. The project will be managed a bit differently in the background with a focus\n    on maximum cost reduction. This includes using different tools, streamlining\n    processes, and refocusing the development strategy of the project. This may\n    not cause a lot of visible changes to the outside environment but will be\n    key to the continued success of the project and the reduction of its costs.\n 2. Some independent initiatives may be pushed by team members, their partners,\n    or outside contractors through the CCS system. The Particl team highly\n    encourages and supports community members making their own proposals.\n 3. Particl team members may independently work with or help different projects\n    which are working on directly expanding Particl’s ecosystem. These may\n    include various independent initiatives, Particl-based applications or\n    businesses, service providers, and etc. Over the past few weeks, there has\n    been a lot brewing in that important regard which has kept some of Particl\n    team members very busy. More details on the topic will be provided at a\n    later date.\n\nImportant Focus on CCS\nThe Particl team has recently released the CCS, a community crowdfunding tool.\nMoving forward, the team may use this system to push independent initiatives or\ncommunity votes. The team strongly recommends the community to also come up with\nits own initiatives to further decentralize the evolution of the Particl\necosystem and stimulate its economy.\n\nIf you have any ideas or proposals, don’t hesitate to reach out to fellow\nParticl community or team members for help. The CCS is the perfect system to\nkickstart Particl’s economy and will prove very useful over time.\n\nRevamped Particl Wiki\nThe Particl Wiki [https://particl.wiki] has recently been significantly improved\nthanks to the incredible work done by Allien, Particl’s UI/UX Lead. It features\na much better navigation/structure and provides a lot of technical documentation\nand guides. The Particl Wiki, which focused on the advanced user, serves as a\ngreat complement to the incoming Particl Academy which will instead focus on the\n“general user” by making all the information as simple to follow and easy to\nunderstand as possible.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Coming\nThere are a lot of really great things coming for Particl. Whereas 2020 has been\na significant development-focused year for Particl, mainly because the great\nmajority of the time has been spent on Particl’s massive V3 update, 2021 should\nfeel more active in terms of outreach and marketing efforts towards vendors and\nusers!\n\nHere are some of what you can expect from Particl in the next couple of weeks.\n\n * The first public testnet build should be ready and made available in a very\n   short amount of time. You’ll then be able to test and play around with\n   Particl V3 for the first time, on testnet.\n * Particl.news has been completely rebranded and will launch in a few days.\n   Particl’s official blog has moved from Medium onto Ghost. The move brings on\n   added functionality for blog posts, a better user experience, and one that is\n   more tailored to Particl.\n * The Particl Academy will launch and provide very easy to understand\n   tutorials, guides, and walk-through guides for people to quickly understand\n   how to use Particl. The academy will release a few days after the public\n   testnet build goes live and contains a massive amount of content.\n * More vendor and customer outreach and onboarding efforts will start once\n   Particl V3 is live. Whereas 2020 was almost exclusively focused on BUIDL,\n   2021 will be much more about the adoption of the marketplace.\n * An automated system to seed the marketplace with thousands of listings will\n   be announced in the next coming days and will be pushed to the CCS for\n   funding. This initiative is a side-project of Particl team members Juha\n   Kovanen and Cryptoguard and serves many different purposes at once. It is\n   also intended to serve as an example for a typical proposal that anyone in\n   the community could come up with and will jumpstart the adoption of Particl\n   Marketplace and the CCS.\n * The Particl team will go through a “monitoring” phase for about a month or so\n   following the mainnet release of V3. This will allow them to detect and fix\n   bugs, collect feedback from the community, apply them to Particl V3.1, and\n   set the ground to establish the development priorities for 2021 and onward.\n * The website will be entirely rebranded and released to support the V3 release\n   and improve the communication of Particl’s mission, products, and brand.\n   Depending on how fast Particl V3 moves from testnet to mainnet, the rebrand\n   of the website may go live only after the mainnet release.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Wait is Almost Over\nThis week, what is supposed to be the last internal build before the public\ntestnet release has been compiled and been going through one final internal\ntesting round.\n\nThat means that the almost year-long wait is almost over! Starting with the\ntestnet release, a lot of exciting stuff will start coming out and a lot of what\nthe team has been quietly working on in the background will be revealed. As\nalways, we don’t want to commit to a specific date or ETA for release, but that\ninformation alone should give you a pretty good idea of where we stand.\n\nFor this reason, stay eyes on the target and don’t miss the announcement of the\npublic testnet coming shortly on Particl.news [https://particl.news/]!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

However, Tecnovert, Particl’s lead cryptographer, has been working on other stuff in the meantime.</p><h2 id=\"xmr-part-atomic-swap\">XMR — PART Atomic Swap</h2><h2 id=\"tecnovert-xmrswap\">tecnovert/xmrswap</h2><h3 id=\"implementation-of-the-h4sh3d-bitcoin-monero-cross-chain-atomic-swap-protocol-\">Implementation of the h4sh3d Bitcoin-Monero Cross-chain Atomic Swap protocol…</h3><h4 id=\"github-com\">github.com</h4><p>Not too long ago, he released the <a href=\"http://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap\" rel=\"noopener\">xmrswap protocol</a> which allows XMR and PART to be exchanged via atomic swaps. For those who don’t know, atomic swaps are contracts of exchange and executed between two users without the assistance of any third-party. They are uncensorable, private, and fully decentralized swaps of value from one cryptocurrency to the other.</p><h2 id=\"particl-core-0-21-1-0\">Particl Core 0.21.1.0</h2><p>He has also put a lot of work into updating the current Particl Core version (0.19) to the latest Bitcoin version (0.21). Since it has been some time since the latest Core update, it’s taken a significant amount of work to complete but it was well worth it due to what’s being introduced by it.</p><p>On Monday the 23rd of November, 2020, Tecnovert has finally pre-released Particl Core 0.21.1.0 on mainnet. We highly recommend downloading and installing the new core version and testing it out. That’ll provide valuable feedback to Tecnovert which he’ll be able to use to finish off the release and push it as a full release.</p><ul><li><strong>Download: </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.1.0rc1\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.1.0rc1</a></li></ul><p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> This release re-introduces 32bit builds which have been requested by some community members. If you happen to be one of those, please download and test these in your environment and report back to the #Development channel.</em></p><h2 id=\"taproot-readiness\">Taproot Readiness</h2><p>Upgrading to the newest core version of Particl introduces the required code for Taproot to make its way onto Particl.</p><p>Taproot is a form of transaction based on “MAST”, but with a little tweak, that allows you to make a complicated conditional transaction (i.e. atomic swap) look like a typical transaction. In Particl’s case, this new feature is specially intended to increase the privacy level of atomic swaps by having them look like any other regular transaction to the outside observer. Check <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/taproot-merged-bitcoin-core\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>this article from CoinDesk</strong></a> for more information about this new protocol improvement.</p><h2 id=\"blockbook-integration\">BlockBook Integration</h2><p>Particl’s invaluable core developer Kewde has recently been working on adding support for Blockbook, a Trezor-compatible block explorer with some extra features. The support should be available within the new few days now, watch for any <a href=\"https://particl.news/\" rel=\"noopener\">Particl.news</a> blog post about it in the coming days.</p><h1 id=\"particl-marketplace-v3-\">Particl Marketplace (V3)</h1><p>In reality, there is very little left to do before the V3 release is ready for public testing.</p><p>- The V3 market codebase has recently been pushed on Github and is now available for public audit. The codebase is complete with all V3 additions and refactored code in place. You can follow its progress and check out the changes here: <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-market/commits/develop\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/particl/particl-market/commits/develop</a></p><p>- During the internal round of testing that’s been going for a couple of weeks now, a bunch of new issues related to the Windows build have popped up and required developers to allocate extra time to them. They have all been resolved as of last week, but please be on the lookout for any Windows-related issues when testing Particl V3 on Windows.</p><p>- It was announced two weeks ago that only notifications and comments needed to be completed before the public release of testnet builds. As of today, it can be reported that the notifications have been fully completed and are currently being tested in recent internal builds.</p><p>- Some issues have arisen concerning the buyflow integration of comments (buyer/seller communication). As the changes required to fix the problem may take some time, the team is exploring releasing the testnet build without this portion of the comment feature for now and integrating it either during public testnet or as a V3.1 release.</p><p>- Current builds have been tested quite extensively by now. The public testnet is expected to go very smoothly and be short in duration before the release can move up onto the mainnet.</p><h1 id=\"in-app-swap-module\">In-app Swap Module</h1><p>Particl’s SMSG bot framework has been significantly improved, but the in-app swap module still requires a bit of work for it to be completely finished off. Additionally, some of Particl’s swap partners (SimpleSwap, StealthEX, and SwapSpace) have been experiencing issues with the PART pair and are actively working on bringing back up.</p><p>The Particl team and these teams have been in constant communication for a while now. The issue is related to Bittrex which has recently changed the terms of how they want to work with swap businesses using their APIs. The exchanges are stating that they are working on solutions to bring PART back up on the exchanges, but it may take some time.</p><p>For this reason, the in-app swap module may unfortunately not be part of the initial V3 release and may, instead, be pushed to the 3.1 release or whenever PART gets back up on these exchanges. Exactly when this happens is yet to be determined but is partly dependent on factors external to Particl.</p><hr><h1 id=\"team-update\">Team Update</h1><p>A few weeks ago and effective at that time, the Particl team and Foundation mutually agreed to take proactive measures to ensure the continued development of the project while at the same time cutting down the costs to the minimum.</p><h2 id=\"cutting-down-on-the-costs\">Cutting Down on the Costs</h2><p>As a result, all salaried Particl team members have agreed to momentarily not take a salary while at the same time pledging to continue the development of the project and its roadmap.</p><p>This is only possible thanks to the passion of each Particl team member and their commitment to Particl’s mission of a more fair, free, and secure environment of eCommerce.</p><h2 id=\"what-does-this-change\">What does this change?</h2><p>In reality, this won’t change much in the sense that the roadmap will still be worked on as planned earlier this year. It does, however, change how the team will approach tackling the roadmap items needed to complete. Here are a few expected changes as a result of this new reality.</p><ol><li>The project will be managed a bit differently in the background with a focus on maximum cost reduction. This includes using different tools, streamlining processes, and refocusing the development strategy of the project. This may not cause a lot of visible changes to the outside environment but will be key to the continued success of the project and the reduction of its costs.</li><li>Some independent initiatives may be pushed by team members, their partners, or outside contractors through the CCS system. The Particl team highly encourages and supports community members making their own proposals.</li><li>Particl team members may independently work with or help different projects which are working on directly expanding Particl’s ecosystem. These may include various independent initiatives, Particl-based applications or businesses, service providers, and etc. Over the past few weeks, there has been a lot brewing in that important regard which has kept some of Particl team members very busy. More details on the topic will be provided at a later date.</li></ol><h2 id=\"important-focus-on-ccs\">Important Focus on CCS</h2><p>The Particl team has recently released the CCS, a community crowdfunding tool. Moving forward, the team may use this system to push independent initiatives or community votes. The team strongly recommends the community to also come up with its own initiatives to further decentralize the evolution of the Particl ecosystem and stimulate its economy.</p><p>If you have any ideas or proposals, don’t hesitate to reach out to fellow Particl community or team members for help. The CCS is the perfect system to kickstart Particl’s economy and will prove very useful over time.</p><h2 id=\"revamped-particl-wiki\">Revamped Particl Wiki</h2><p>The <a href=\"https://particl.wiki\" rel=\"noopener\">Particl Wiki</a> has recently been significantly improved thanks to the incredible work done by Allien, Particl’s UI/UX Lead. It features a much better navigation/structure and provides a lot of technical documentation and guides. The Particl Wiki, which focused on the advanced user, serves as a great complement to the incoming Particl Academy which will instead focus on the “general user” by making all the information as simple to follow and easy to understand as possible.</p><hr><h1 id=\"what-s-coming\">What’s Coming</h1><p>There are a lot of really great things coming for Particl. Whereas 2020 has been a significant development-focused year for Particl, mainly because the great majority of the time has been spent on Particl’s massive V3 update, 2021 should feel more active in terms of outreach and marketing efforts towards vendors and users!</p><p>Here are some of what you can expect from Particl in the next couple of weeks.</p><ul><li>The <strong>first public testnet</strong> build should be ready and made available in a very short amount of time. You’ll then be able to test and play around with Particl V3 for the first time, on testnet.</li><li><strong>Particl.news has been completely rebranded</strong> and will launch in a few days. Particl’s official blog has moved from Medium onto Ghost. The move brings on added functionality for blog posts, a better user experience, and one that is more tailored to Particl.</li><li>The <strong>Particl Academy</strong> will launch and provide very easy to understand tutorials, guides, and walk-through guides for people to quickly understand how to use Particl. The academy will release a few days after the public testnet build goes live and contains a massive amount of content.</li><li><strong>More vendor and customer outreach and onboarding efforts</strong> will start once Particl V3 is live. Whereas 2020 was almost exclusively focused on BUIDL, 2021 will be much more about the adoption of the marketplace.</li><li><strong>An automated system to seed the marketplace with thousands of listings</strong> will be announced in the next coming days and will be pushed to the CCS for funding. This initiative is a side-project of Particl team members Juha Kovanen and Cryptoguard and serves many different purposes at once. It is also intended to serve as an example for a typical proposal that anyone in the community could come up with and will jumpstart the adoption of Particl Marketplace and the CCS.</li><li>The Particl team will go through a<strong> “monitoring” phase</strong> for about a month or so following the mainnet release of V3. This will allow them to detect and fix bugs, collect feedback from the community, apply them to Particl V3.1, and set the ground to establish the development priorities for 2021 and onward.</li><li>The<strong> website will be entirely rebranded</strong> and released to support the V3 release and improve the communication of Particl’s mission, products, and brand. Depending on how fast Particl V3 moves from testnet to mainnet, the rebrand of the website may go live only after the mainnet release.</li></ul><hr><h1 id=\"the-wait-is-almost-over\">The Wait is Almost Over</h1><p>This week, what is supposed to be the last internal build before the public testnet release has been compiled and been going through one final internal testing round.</p><p>That means that the almost year-long wait is almost over! Starting with the testnet release, a lot of exciting stuff will start coming out and a lot of what the team has been quietly working on in the background will be revealed. As always, we don’t want to commit to a specific date or ETA for release, but that information alone should give you a pretty good idea of where we stand.</p><p><strong>For this reason, stay eyes on the target and don’t miss the announcement of the public testnet coming shortly on </strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Particl.news</strong></a><strong>!</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

✅\nSince the last Development Update\n[https://particl.news/development-update-10-08-2020-d0c1e6b29ad0], Particl V3\nhas progressed remarkably well and has finally been compiled into a working\nbuild this past Friday, the 15th of October 2020, which is currently undergoing\ninternal testing before going live.\n\nParticl V3 is the upcoming massive Particl update. It brings forward a\ncompletely new and improved desktop application, a refactored marketplace with\nbetter performance than ever, and a ton of long-awaited features such as, among\nmany, multi-markets. To learn more about Particl V3, head over to this blog post\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813] \nor check out this article\n[https://dt.gl/decommerce-is-about-to-become-a-reality-2/] published today on \nDecentralize Today [http://decentralize.today].\n\nStepping Things Up Again With Particl Desktop 3.0A New Breakthrough for Privacy\nand eCommerce ?particl.news\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\nWe’ve got a lot to report on today, and a few surprise features and\nfunctionalities as well, so let’s jump into it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl V3 Progress Report\nAs announced on the 15th of October\n[https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1316810699650277376], the first\nsuccessful build of Particl V3 has been compiled and the client has been going\nthrough thorough internal testing before it can be published publicly.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.0 Splash Screen (WIP)So where do things stand now, considering\nthat important development milestone is reached? Here is the latest progress\nreport which should give you a good overall idea.\n\n- All core functionalities of the marketplace have been completed and\nsuccessfully integrated into the improved Particl Desktop 3.0 client. “Core\nfunctionalities” refer to all basic marketplace interactions, including the\nselling and purchasing of products, the escrow system, the creation/sharing of\nmulti-markets, etc.\n\n- Particl Desktop 3.0 is now at feature parity level with Particl Desktop 2.0,\nmeaning that all desktop features that were present on Particl Desktop up to\nParticl Desktop 2.1 are now present in 3.0 and working fine. This excludes all\nthe new features introduced by 3.0, which are now integrated as well.\n\n- New features introduced by Particl V3 are completed, successfully integrated,\nand undergoing internal testing. These include multi-markets and storefronts,\nuser identities, modular approach to desktop client, coin control, anon listing\nfees, increased default ring signatures, anon order releasing, user market\ndashboard, UTXO splitter, etc, More information on some of these features in the\nfollowing section.\n\nParticl Desktop Market Overview (WIP)- Pre-existing features introduced in versions between Particl Desktop 2.0 and\nthe current latest version (2.3.5) are currently being reworked and improved to\nreach much smoother integrations and interaction with the new 3.0. These include \ncomments, as well as its new integration within the buy flow (you can now\ncommunicate with the other party, in the middle of an escrow transaction, to\nresolve any potential issue), bulk product import, and in-app swap module. These\nspecific items are not expected to take much longer before they are fully ready.\n\n- The first few internal builds of Particl V3 (there have been now over 5\niterations of it, each improving on previous issues and fixing bugs) have been \nvery stable, fast, and smooth considering the scope of the improvements and new\nfeatures added. There have, however, been a few issues notably with the speed\nand stability of Windows builds and this has been a major point of focus for the\nteam during the past few days. It has now identified the root of these issues\nand is in the process of promptly applying the required fixes.\n\n- Minor bugs and issues are being picked up and addressed all throughout this\ninternal testing phase.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNew Features and Functionalities Announcement\nParticl V3 introduces a bunch of new features and functionalities that\nsignificantly improves the user experience. Most of these additions are a direct\nresult of feedback and comments collected from you and all other Particl\ncommunity members. Because of this, the Particl team would like to thank you for\nhelping to identify areas of struggle and help improve DeCommerce.\n\nWe are excited to announce today a few features which have either been\nunannounced as of yet or have received minimal coverage. They are as follows.\n\nCoin Control Arrives in Particl Desktop\nParticl Desktop’s Coin Control (WIP)This feature was teased on Twitter\n[https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1300772895812091907] on the first of\nSeptember and can now finally be revealed. Coin Control is the ability to better\ncontrol the parameters of a transaction by selecting exactly which output(s) to\nuse when sending funds.\n\nAlthough this is an advanced feature, it is very useful to a lot of users which\nforced them to constantly switch between Particl Desktop and Particl-Qt wallets\njust to properly manage their outgoing transactions. Coin Control is now\navailable right from Particl Desktop!\n\nAnonymous Payment of Listing Fees (Anon Balances)\nIn Particl V2, listings used to be paid with public balances. Although that is\nstill the default behavior, you can now easily choose to pay for listing fees\nusing your anon balance. This significantly improves the level of privacy when\nadding listings to the marketplace, but it also has a few drawbacks such as\nlonger delays for listings to appear on the marketplace and can also negatively\nimpact the ability to list multiple listings at once.\n\nThat’s because anon “outputs” require 12 confirmations until they are confirmed\nby the network and can be used in new transactions. If you want to list multiple\nlistings at once and pay for the listing fees using your anon balance, you’ll at\nleast need as many anon outputs as the number of listings you’re trying to list\nat once.\n\nUTXO splitter\nTo facilitate the creation of many anon outputs, Particl V3 will also introduce\na UTXO splitter. This will allow you to set up your balances in such a way that\nyou’re going to be able to buy and sell multiple listings at once.\n\nWhen converting funds from a public balance to an anon balance, it used to\ncreate a single output. Outputs are kind of like internal balances that are used\nto execute transactions. A single address may have multiple outputs.\n\nWhenever you need to make an anon transaction, for example paying for an item,\nlisting a product on the marketplace, or just privately sending funds to\nsomeone, it locks the full amount contained in the output for 12 confirmations\n(~24 minutes). That’s true even if you don’t use the total number of coins\ncontained in that output. And then, if you had, for example, 2 outputs in a\nsingle address and tried to purchase 3 items, then you would have only been able\nto buy 2 items and then having to wait 24 minutes just to buy the third one. Of\ncourse, if the cost of an item can’t be covered by the full amount contained in\na single output, then 2 or more outputs may be used to cover the payment,\nleading to even more annoyances.\n\nWith Particl V3, you’ll now be able to specify how many outputs you want\nwhenever making an anon transaction (or balance conversion). The recommended\nbehavior is to create multiple outputs whenever converting balances, that way\nyou’ll ensure that you’re not going to encounter any bumps when making\nmarketplace payments for multiple listings at once.\n\nOrder Payments and Escrow Deposits Now Sent in Anon Balances\nIn Particl V2, order payments and escrow security deposits used to be sent into\nblind balances once transactions were completed. That is not the case anymore.\n\nWhen completing a transaction, you will receive your due funds into your anon\nbalance. This improves the level of privacy associated with using Particl\nMarketplace to even higher than before and makes it impossible for outside\nobservers to track the revenue of sellers and deposits of buyers.\n\nHigher Default Value for the Number of Ring Signatures\nNew Default Ring Signature Number (WIP)When making an anon transaction (RingCT),\nyour privacy is protected using what’s referred to as “ring signatures” (read\nthe Particl Explained — Private Transactions\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd] \narticle for more details). As a general rule of thumb, the more ring signatures\nused in a transaction, the greater your level of privacy gets. But much more\nthan that, a higher number of ring signatures also improves the level of privacy\nof other users’ anon transactions.\n\nWith Particl Desktop 3.0, the number of default ring signatures used to\nanonymize RingCT transactions (anon) has been increased to 24. You, as well as\neveryone else making anonymous transactions, will now benefit from greater data\nsecurity!.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThoughts From Particl Desktop Developer Arnold Bansermer\nRecently, Particl Desktop developer Arnold Bansemer commented on a question from\nthe community about the perceived slow speed development for Particl V3. Because\nhis reply provides valuable insights into the process, we’ve decided to include\nit in this Development Update so that you can get an inside perspective on the\nmatter.\n\n“I want to mention that development is not occurring slowly. It’s progressing at\na much faster pace than what we were producing before. It may appear slow from\nthe outset perhaps due to visibility over the changes actually being made, so\nperhaps this is the actual concern.\n\nBut for perspective — in basically ten months, we’ve done major surgery on both\nParticl Desktop and the marketplace codebase which are both nearing release\nreadiness. That’s compared to Particl V2 (which includes Particl Desktop 2.0 to\nthe current version that’s live on mainnet) which took a lot longer than ten\nmonths to complete, taking in fact more than two years. That’s on top of doing\nthe R&D that’s necessary to actually make the newer stuff work.\n\nKeep in mind that this isn’t some copy/paste job, so when adding/updating\nfunctionalities we need to figure it out as well, and find a way to do it\nwithout sacrificing security/privacy which are core Particl values, or degrading\nthe UX significantly, etc.\n\nAll of that is coming from a team that’s a lot smaller than most dev products\nout there as it is, let alone in the crypto space. So while team members and\ndevelopers might seem quiet, it’s because we’re mostly focused on getting the\napplications finalized.”— Arnold Bansemer, Lead Particl Desktop Developer\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArriving at Destination\nThe Particl team would like to thank you for your continued support and patience \nin this long journey that has been the development of Particl V3. The team is\nfully aware of your expectations and is confident that V3’s release will be\nmeaningful not only for the Particl project but the entire world of DeCommerce.\nPlease bear with us as we thoroughly test the new builds and ensure the release\ngets the impact it deserves.\n\nThe team is very excited to finally be reaching the end of this phase of\ndevelopment and looks forward to embarking on new challenges following this\nlong-awaited release.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

Here is the latest progress report which should give you a good overall idea.</p><p>- <strong>All core functionalities of the marketplace have been completed and successfully integrated</strong> into the improved Particl Desktop 3.0 client. “Core functionalities” refer to all basic marketplace interactions, including the selling and purchasing of products, the escrow system, the creation/sharing of multi-markets, etc.</p><p>- Particl Desktop 3.0 is now at<strong> feature parity level with Particl Desktop 2.0</strong>, meaning that all desktop features that were present on Particl Desktop up to Particl Desktop 2.1 are now present in 3.0 and working fine. This excludes all the new features introduced by 3.0, which are now integrated as well.</p><p>- <strong>New features introduced by Particl V3 are completed, successfully integrated, and undergoing internal testing</strong>. These include multi-markets and storefronts, user identities, modular approach to desktop client, coin control, anon listing fees, increased default ring signatures, anon order releasing, user market dashboard, UTXO splitter, etc, More information on some of these features in the following section.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*LZhmJtAxgDgSLm6dY6QL6g.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl Desktop Market Overview (WIP)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>- Pre-existing features</strong> introduced in versions between Particl Desktop 2.0 and the current latest version (2.3.5) are <strong>currently being reworked and improved</strong> to reach much smoother integrations and interaction with the new 3.0. These include <strong>comments</strong>, as well as its <strong>new integration within the buy flow</strong> (you can now communicate with the other party, in the middle of an escrow transaction, to resolve any potential issue), <strong>bulk product import</strong>, and <strong>in-app swap module</strong>. These specific items are not expected to take much longer before they are fully ready.</p><p>- <strong>The first few internal builds of Particl V3</strong> (there have been now over 5 iterations of it, each improving on previous issues and fixing bugs) have been <strong>very stable</strong>, <strong>fast</strong>, and <strong>smooth</strong> considering the scope of the improvements and new features added. There have, however, been a <strong>few issues notably with the speed and stability of Windows builds</strong> and this has been a major point of focus for the team during the past few days. It has now identified the root of these issues and is <strong>in the process of promptly applying the required fixes</strong>.</p><p>- Minor bugs and issues are being picked up and addressed all throughout this internal testing phase.</p><hr><h2 id=\"new-features-and-functionalities-announcement\">New Features and Functionalities Announcement</h2><p>Particl V3 introduces a bunch of new features and functionalities that significantly improves the user experience. Most of these additions are a direct result of feedback and comments collected from you and all other Particl community members. Because of this, <strong>the Particl team would like to thank you</strong> for helping to identify areas of struggle and help improve DeCommerce.</p><p>We are excited to announce today a few features which have either been unannounced as of yet or have received minimal coverage. They are as follows.</p><h3 id=\"coin-control-arrives-in-particl-desktop\">Coin Control Arrives in Particl Desktop</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*MOG23cQ1lv3sEYuCm_Rwug.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl Desktop’s Coin Control (WIP)</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1300772895812091907\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>This feature was teased on Twitter</strong></a> on the first of September and can now finally be revealed. Coin Control is the ability to better control the parameters of a transaction by selecting exactly which output(s) to use when sending funds.</p><p>Although this is an advanced feature, it is very useful to a lot of users which forced them to constantly switch between Particl Desktop and Particl-Qt wallets just to properly manage their outgoing transactions. <strong>Coin Control is now available right from Particl Desktop!</strong></p><h3 id=\"anonymous-payment-of-listing-fees-anon-balances-\">Anonymous Payment of Listing Fees (Anon Balances)</h3><p>In Particl V2, listings used to be paid with public balances. Although that is still the default behavior, <strong>you can now easily choose to pay for listing fees using your anon balance</strong>. This significantly improves the level of privacy when adding listings to the marketplace, but it also has a few drawbacks such as longer delays for listings to appear on the marketplace and can also negatively impact the ability to list multiple listings at once.</p><p>That’s because anon “outputs” require 12 confirmations until they are confirmed by the network and can be used in new transactions. If you want to list multiple listings at once and pay for the listing fees using your anon balance, you’ll at least need as many anon outputs as the number of listings you’re trying to list at once.</p><h3 id=\"utxo-splitter\">UTXO splitter</h3><p>To facilitate the creation of many anon outputs, Particl V3 will also introduce a UTXO splitter. This will allow you to set up your balances in such a way that you’re going to be able to buy and sell multiple listings at once.</p><p>When converting funds from a public balance to an anon balance, it used to create a single output. Outputs are kind of like internal balances that are used to execute transactions. A single address may have multiple outputs.</p><p>Whenever you need to make an anon transaction, for example paying for an item, listing a product on the marketplace, or just privately sending funds to someone, it locks the full amount contained in the output for 12 confirmations (~24 minutes). That’s true even if you don’t use the total number of coins contained in that output. And then, if you had, for example, 2 outputs in a single address and tried to purchase 3 items, then you would have only been able to buy 2 items and then having to wait 24 minutes just to buy the third one. Of course, if the cost of an item can’t be covered by the full amount contained in a single output, then 2 or more outputs may be used to cover the payment, leading to even more annoyances.</p><p>With Particl V3, <strong>you’ll now be able to specify how many outputs you want whenever making an anon transaction (or balance conversion)</strong>. The recommended behavior is to create multiple outputs whenever converting balances, that way you’ll ensure that you’re not going to encounter any bumps when making marketplace payments for multiple listings at once.</p><h3 id=\"order-payments-and-escrow-deposits-now-sent-in-anon-balances\">Order Payments and Escrow Deposits Now Sent in Anon Balances</h3><p>In Particl V2, order payments and escrow security deposits used to be sent into blind balances once transactions were completed. That is not the case anymore.</p><p><strong>When completing a transaction, you will receive your due funds into your anon balance</strong>. This improves the level of privacy associated with using Particl Marketplace to even higher than before and makes it impossible for outside observers to track the revenue of sellers and deposits of buyers.</p><h3 id=\"higher-default-value-for-the-number-of-ring-signatures\">Higher Default Value for the Number of Ring Signatures</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*u7hY_BM3Zf4QeHpFylnMgQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>New Default Ring Signature Number (WIP)</figcaption></figure><p>When making an anon transaction (RingCT), your privacy is protected using what’s referred to as “ring signatures” (read the <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Particl Explained — Private Transactions</strong></a> article for more details). As a general rule of thumb, the more ring signatures used in a transaction, the greater your level of privacy gets. But much more than that, a higher number of ring signatures also improves the level of privacy of other users’ anon transactions.</p><p>With Particl Desktop 3.0, <strong>the number of default ring signatures used to anonymize RingCT transactions (anon) has been increased to 24</strong>. You, as well as everyone else making anonymous transactions, will now benefit from greater data security!.</p><hr><h3 id=\"thoughts-from-particl-desktop-developer-arnold-bansermer\">Thoughts From Particl Desktop Developer Arnold Bansermer</h3><p>Recently, Particl Desktop developer Arnold Bansemer commented on a question from the community about the perceived slow speed development for Particl V3. Because his reply provides valuable insights into the process, we’ve decided to include it in this Development Update so that you can get an inside perspective on the matter.</p><p><em>“I want to mention that development is not occurring slowly. It’s progressing at a much faster pace than what we were producing before. It may appear slow from the outset perhaps due to visibility over the changes actually being made, so perhaps this is the actual concern.</em></p><p><em>But for perspective — in basically ten months, we’ve done major surgery on both Particl Desktop and the marketplace codebase which are both nearing release readiness.
