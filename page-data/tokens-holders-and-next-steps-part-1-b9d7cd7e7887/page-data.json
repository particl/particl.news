As I mentioned above, we are 3+ weeks into the\nprocess of assigning PART to SDC token holders with nearly 64% of the network\nalready converted. This leaves roughly 2 million tokens still remaining to be\nconverted and only 5 days left to swap them for PART. Broken into sections below\nare 3 groups of participants.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGroup 1: Token holders who have chosen to exchange SDC for PART.\nThis is our largest group and represents nearly 1100 participants at the time of\nthis post. 64% of SDC token holders have swapped to PART and are supporting the\nteam as we deliver Particl, an open source, decentralized privacy platform built\nfor global person to person eCommerce.\n\nSubgroup A: Participants who have been made whole.\n\nYou fall into this group if:\n\n 1. In your dashboard, SDC REQUIRED balance is 0.00000000\n 2. In your dashboard, BTC REQUIRED balance is 0.00000000\n 3. You’ve successfully confirmed your email address\n 4. You can verify you can reset your password with the email on file\n\nCongratulations! You are in the majority (>97%)\n\nSubgroup B: Participants who are half full.\n\nYou fall into this group if:\n\n 1. In your dashboard, SDC REQUIRED balance is 0.00000000\n 2. In your dashboard, BTC REQUIRED balance is 0.00000000\n 3. You can not confirm your email.\n\nA small number of participants have had trouble getting their confirmation email\nto properly work. Please login, request a new confirmation email, double check\nyour spam folder and click the confirm link.\n\n * If you don’t receive the email please double check your spam folder\n * If you still don’t receive the email please let us know; hello@particl.io\n   [https://hello@particl.io/]\n\nSubgroup C: Participants who are half empty.\n\nYou fall into this group if:\n\n 1. In your dashboard, SDC REQUIRED has a positive balance (OR)\n 2. You sent SDC directly to the SDC Conversion Address: \n    SUaqjDUwAuVKnmWUX5tgU3fK1PkmbdfVCD\n    [https://chainz.cryptoid.info/sdc/address.dws?SUaqjDUwAuVKnmWUX5tgU3fK1PkmbdfVCD.htm] \n     (AND/OR)\n 3.

The majority of SDC/BTC sent straight to the transparency\naddresses has been straight donations but a few of you have reached out to us\nsaying you accidentally sent tokens there versus the addresses you generated in\nyour dashboard. If you accidentally sent it straight to the SDC/BTC transparency\naddresses (A common confusion for donators used to Proof of Burn fundraisers\nand/or Ethereum ICOs) then we will work with you to properly link your funds and\napply any 15% bonus (only available for over-donated BTC) after the completion\nof the token exchange. By law our multi-signature transparency wallets can’t be\naccessed by our custodians until the terms of the exchange are completed.\n\nGroup 1 next steps:\n\nThe final Terms for the new Particl (PART) tokens is being finalized by our\nLegal council and in the coming days we will be contacting you to have you login\nto your dashboard. A new mechanism for generating a personal receiving address\noffline and linking it to your account for PART distribution will be active,\nalong with an updated Terms and Conditions. For now hold tight, you are ready\nfor the next steps.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGroup 2: Token holders who still have SDC tokens on exchanges.\nThis is the second largest group and the majority of people remaining to\nexchange SDC for PART. We have begun discussions with all exchanges that have\nSDC services. Since this isn’t a traditional coinswap all SDC coins on exchanges\nwill need to be transferred off the exchange and into PART or they will be lost\nforever. Remember, the Particl token exchange offers an exclusive first right of\nrefusal to current SDC token holders to get PART. Once the 4 week exchange\nperiod wraps up any SDC tokens left behind on exchanges or in personal wallets\nwill void the PART exchange offer.\n\nGroup 2 next steps:\n\nWe strongly encourage SDC token holders interested in getting PART tokens to\nbegin moving coins off the exchanges and into the Particl token exchange\n[https://particl.io/].
