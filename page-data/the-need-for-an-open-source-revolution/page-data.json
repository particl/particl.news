Although the\ntermination itself seems questionable, the legal fight it engendered reveals\ntroubling revelations on a much broader scope.\n\nAccording to Lawson’s suit\n[https://docs.reclaimthenet.org/Brennan-Lawson-Lawsuit.pdf], Facebook introduced\nin late 2018 a protocol that allowed members of its team — “a group of\napproximately 100 employees responsible for (...) high visibility inquiries from\nmembers of the media and governments” — to access all data from the Facebook\nMessenger application even if the user entirely deleted the data.\n\nThis practice, while hardly surprising, is in stark contrast to earlier claims\nby Facebook about their handling of reportedly “deleted” and unarchived data and\nradically undermines all Facebook users’ alleged ability to control the privacy\nof their personal information. With no safeguards regarding age restrictions,\nanyone’s Messenger history can be accessed with the back-end protocol — even\nthat of children.\n\nThis protocol, if confirmed, would certainly violate Facebook's own privacy\npolicies, but also online privacy rules of the European union — and although a \n2012 FTC ruling on consumer privacy\n[https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2012/03/ftc-issues-final-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy] \nand the 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act\n[https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-coppa] \nheld Meta and other companies to a higher level of transparency with regards to\nthe data they did collect, it seems not all regulations are created equal.\n\nAn important reason behind this intrusive protocol was, allegedly, to “keep\nFacebook in the good graces of the American government”. This complete lack of\ntransparency, along with recent reports of ex-CIA hires to Meta’s online\nsecurity operations and various content moderation teams, raises much concern.\n\nThe Open-Source Imperative Against Invasive Government\nFor people paying attention to the state of privacy and world surveillance in\nthe past few decades, none of this is surprising. It is instead highly\nvindicating. Thankfully, the tools exist to allow us to change the world for the\nbetter — and optimistic individuals may say it’s only a matter of time.\n\nOpen-source software, above all, imposes itself as an inevitable alternative to\nan otherwise grim outlook for online privacy. Although still lacking in\ndevelopment in the world of social media compared to their closed-source\ncounterparts, an open-source approach guarantees transparency in the most\nuncompromising way, and, in turn, empowers us with significantly more privacy\nfor our data. And even though the ethics of open-source developers, contrary to\nwhat we see today at Meta and other popular platforms, often perfectly align\nwith the goal to undermine those privacy abuses, there is not even a need for\ntrusting any policy in the face of total transparency and auditability!\n\nThe good news is, although the path to counter-balance the widespread spying\nand\nmonetization\n[https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/] of our\npersonal data is uphill, it is also in numerous good and devoted hands. \n\nThe open-source revolution we so deeply need can only come about via the true\n\"liberation\" of our online services.

privacy-first, decentralized\napplications. This is the case for its Particl Marketplace, which allows anyone\nin the world to buy and sell goods and services, physical or digital, in total\nprivacy.\n\n The marketplace dApp uses a mix of P2P and blockchain technologies, meaning\nthat it is run in an entirely distributed way from start to finish — no\nthird-party or intermediary ever has any sort of centralized role or control\nover its network. \n\nThis, by design, ensures the highest levels of privacy and security for the\nnetwork as a whole and is radically resistant to censorship. Particl\nMarketplace’s unique and sophisticated escrow system abides by these same\nprinciples, presenting many users with substantial benefits.\n\nThe Need for an Escrow model\nA staple of online market environments is the presence of an escrow system: when\ntrading with strangers, users need to be confident that the other party will\nkeep their end of the agreement and act in good faith throughout. That is why\ncontract security and enforcement are essential when trading goods and services\nin any marketplace.\n\n\nOne common solution eCommerce platforms and payment processors use is a\nmutually-trusted third party — in other words, an escrow agent or “issue\nresolution center”. In the context of a decentralized marketplace, this incurs a\ncritical problem: the introduction of a centralized moderating entity. It also\nattracts its own privacy issues as well as some economic drawbacks. Let’s\nexplore what this means for Particl Marketplace.\n\nCommon Issues With Traditional Escrow Models\nWith traditional escrow, a third-party (the escrow agent) holds onto an asset\nand releases it when the transaction is completed (i.e., the purchased item is\ndelivered). That role is generally assumed by the marketplace or exchange itself\n(i.e., Amazon, Openbazaar), a payment processor (i.e., Paypal, Visa), or\nthird-party escrow services (i.e., a bank or a financial institution). This\nallows potential disputes or issues to be safely settled, but it also carries\nimportant issues.\n\nFirstly, running escrow or issue resolution services incurs a heavy cost\nreflected in the platform's fees. When added to every link of a supply chain,\nthis fee ends up substantially impacting retail prices and making up a large\nportion of the final price of nearly all products we buy daily.\n\nAdditionally, when an issue arises, it is usually settled according to a very\nrigid set of policies rather than being dealt with on a case-by-case basis. This\nallows for more issues to be resolved quickly and efficiently but can also lead\nto biased resolutions that benefit the operator's own bottom line. In turn,\nscammers have perfected the art of defeating these hard-set policies to steal\nmoney, products, or both, from rule-abiding users and sellers. Online merchants\nare well aware of this problem and hedge their exposure to this risk through\ntheir prices, an unfortunate reality that the customer is ultimately led to bear\nthe costs.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, these solutions offer no privacy at all\nto their users and incur intrusive data requirements due to the operator needing\nto be aware of every detail related to a single transaction to fulfill its role.\nThis gives them complete oversight and insight over all the sensitive and, at\ntimes, confidential, personal, professional, financial, and commercial data\ncollected from the platform's users — which they, in turn, can use in accordance\nwith their interests, often to the detriment of the individuals and businesses\nusing the platform\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/].\n\nParticl’s Two-Party Online Escrow Solution\nParticl adopts a radically different escrow model which addresses the issues\nmentioned above. Often dubbed a “two-party escrow\", or \"MAD escrow\", it involves\nonly two parties; the buyer and the seller, with no one else in between.\n\nInstead of requiring a third party to hold the payment on behalf of two\ntransacting parties, both participants are required to provide collateral by\nmaking an equal security deposit into a smart-contract. This security deposit\ncan be adjusted from 0 to 100% of the total value of the item or service sold\nand is automatically refunded, in its entirety, once both parties mark the\ntransaction as completed. Notably, this form of decentralized escrow is\ninfinitely scalable, as there are no operating costs associated with running\nthese types of cryptographically-enforced contracts and no escrow agents\nrequired for it to function.\n\nIf a dispute or issue arises, both parties need to mutually agree on a\nsatisfying resolution for the transaction to be marked as complete. Because the\ntwo parties have a security deposit locked into the escrow smart-contract, they\nare naturally forced to collaborate and reach a reasonable resolution for both. \nThis method of escrow allows the Particl marketplace to preserve the privacy of\neveryone involved in every instance.\n\nAnother important but often overlooked advantage of two-party escrows involves\nsellers and cash flow. Although 2-of-2 escrow demands a security deposit, which\nmay, on first thought, appear as a cash flow-inhibiting process, it is\ncompletely shielded from assets being frozen by entities like Amazon or Paypal\n[https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/01/paypal-stole-users-money-after-freezing-seizing-funds-lawsuit-alleges/] \nin the event of a dispute or perceived terms of use violations. Unfortunately,\nthis is an extremely common reality for providers of services and goods on those\nplatforms and can cause assets to remain in limbo for up to 6 months or even\npermanently\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/NootropicsDepot/comments/jyeeyh/will_there_ever_be_a_paypal_option_to_pay/]\n. For many sellers, such a risk could prove fatal to their business\n[https://realbusiness.co.uk/paypal-is-becoming-toxic-to-small-business].\n\nMutually Assured Destruction Game Theory\nBy definition, game theory simply refers to the study of mathematical models of\nstrategic interaction among rational decision-makers\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory]. In other words, it incentivizes\nrational decision-making and simultaneously disincentivizes irrational/dishonest\nbehavior.\n\nTo accomplish that desired outcome within the context of a two-party escrow\nsystem, Particl leverages the Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) game theory in\na financial context. “MAD” is a military doctrine “based on the theory of\ndeterrence, which stipulates that the threat of using strong weapons against the\nenemy prevents the enemy’s use of those same weapons. The strategy is a form of\nNash equilibrium in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to\ninitiate a conflict or to disarm” (Wikipedia\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction]).\n\nBy combining Particl’s implementation of BIP 65\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki] , which allows\na transaction output to be made unspendable until some point in the future, with\nthe advanced trustless data transmission capabilities of the SMSG network\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/], the\nmarketplace’s two-party escrow system locks funds in a secure multi-signature\nsmart-contract until all parties sign off on the transaction. This also\nencourages communication and negotiation between buyers and sellers if a\ntransaction goes wrong.\n\nThe result: Enabling Total Privacy in the Business World\nOne of Particl’s two-party escrow’s unique functionality resides in how it keeps\nall aspects of every transaction private-by-default. When you protect a\nmarketplace trade with the escrow system, you ensure that all data and\ninformation related to the transaction and its participants remain anonymous to\noutside observers. This is made possible by the complete absence of\nthird-parties involved, as well as the escrow’s smart contract itself being\nbuilt with some of the latest privacy technologies to guarantee anonymity down\nto the protocol level.\n\nIndeed, as we’ve mentioned above, Particl’s two-party escrow system leverages a\ncombination of its unique SMSG network as well as the BIP 65 proposal\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki] originally\nimplemented on Bitcoin. But that in itself is not enough to offer a satisfactory\nlevel of privacy; it merely allows trustless escrow transactions to take place.\n\nTo provide the escrow contract with the required privacy, payments and security\ndeposits are sent as “Confidential Transactions\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_part_coin.html#blind-transactions]\n”, a transaction type that hides the transferred amounts. To hide the identity\nof the participants as well, a RingCT transaction\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_part_coin.html#anon-transactions] \nis then directly chained into the initial Confidential Transaction’s outputs,\nultimately hiding all information about both the transacted amounts and\nparticipants to anyone not involved with the transaction. This offers the\nhighest level of transactional privacy possible, one not remotely possible with\ntraditional escrow models such as those we see on the most popular online\nmarketplaces and payment processors.\n\nNotably, this form of anonymous escrow smart-contract is an impressive feat\nconsidering that RingCT transactions are very rigid and not even supposed to be\nable to interact with smart-contracts.

Some of them are due to its commitment to trustless privacy, the\nabsence of commissions or escrow fees, or the MAD system’s inherent resistance\nto abuse.\n\nWhile all those advantages stand on their own, they particularly shine in the\ncontexts of:\n\nProviding unstoppable, uncensorable eCommerce gateways for otherwise censored\nindividuals or blocked regions.\n\nThere are many cases of individuals running online stores getting censored or\nshut down by their provider — be it a payment processor, hosting provider, or\neCommerce platform operator. The same can be said of people living in specific\nregions of the world that are banned from traditional financial services or\nsimply unbanked.\n\nBecause even settlements on Particl can be achieved purely peer-to-peer, such\nindividuals now have the new-found option of easily opening up a storefront and\nengaging in restriction-less commerce without the possibility for an escrow\nservice to weigh in, intervene on, or run interference in the process.\n\nIn other words, a trustless, private, and truly person-to-person escrow model,\nespecially when supported by an equally open and free marketplace environment\n[https://particl.io/marketplace], creates a global free market environment where\neveryone, regardless of who they are and where they live, gets to do business on\na fair, level playing field.\n\nProtection of intellectual property\n\nIn a powerful, reliable escrow system without third-party involvement, users are\nassured that it is impossible for their marketplace service provider (in this\ncase, Particl Marketplace [https://particl.io/marketplace]) to spy on them or\ncollect valuable data information.\n\nThis is a reassuring news for sellers, and especially product inventors, as\nsalvaged data from centralized escrow system providers is usually sold (often\ndirectly to competitors) and re-used by the platform operator itself; a practice\nthat goes directly against a seller’s best interest and, at times, frustratingly\nleads to the total destruction of one’s business as we’ve explored in this \nParticl Story [https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/].\n\nProviding additional means for wholesalers and goods manufacturers to\nsell/dispose of excess stock\n\nWhen wholesalers reach a point of critical excess inventory, they need to get\nrid of excess inventory at a minimal cost. Unfortunately, this makes using\ntraditional marketplace environments problematic due to its many layers of\nthird-party involvement and associated costs.\n\nWith Particl Marketplace, they can do so with no additional sales costs thanks\nto Particl’s marketplace protocol zero-commission approach and the absence of\nmiddlemen involved. This is a scenario where both the wholesaler and the\nconsumer get more out of their assets, ultimately reducing the total volume of\nwaste/discarded products.\n\nMore direct, more liquid, and more secure B2B and B2C trades.\n\nThis is made possible by Particl Marketplace’s zero fees and zero data\ncollection approach, which is unmatched in any other system (even in\ncustom-built systems, the central entity running this system, such as a central\nserver or database, can always collect some amount of data.)\n\nAvoiding scams when making in-person or high-value transactions\n\nParticl Marketplace and its two-party escrow system can be used to secure\nin-person transactions when an added layer of security is wanted or required,\nsuch as when two strangers physically meet to trade together.\n\nThe two-party escrow system, in this case, acts as a near-free trade assurance\nservice and eliminates the need for trust and any incentive of foul play. This\nsimple MAD escrow protection brings significant plus-value to any in-person\ntrade between strangers, whether for small transactions such as on Facebook\nMarketplace trades or luxury goods like, for example, the sale of a piece of art\nor an expensive watch.\n\nAs an additional protection layer when trading with trusted business partners\n\nWhen two people often trade with each other directly, they may end up building\ntrust and not require the full range of costly escrow services offered by\neCommerce platforms. Particl’s escrow system can then function as a near-free\nlayer of additional protection so that both parties don't have to trade naked,\nprotecting each of them against \"long cons\" or sudden shifts in the other\nparty's behavior. \n\nIt allows a buyer and a seller to reap nearly all the benefits of removing\ntraditional marketplace environments and associated fees from their business\nrelationship while keeping a level of trade assurance to protect both parties\nagainst unforeseen risks. Should the worst happen, both parties are incentivized\nto find a solution acceptable to all.\n\nTo sell products that are heavily restricted or even banned by regulated\nentities, such as medicine.\n\nThis possibility opens the door to a whole world of cross-border arbitrage, as\nheavily regulated products often vary wildly in price from one market to\nanother. It can also empower individuals to access products that are removed\nfrom circulation or difficult to acquire in their region, such as is often the\ncase of medicinal products or even literature (i.e., books banned due to a\nspecific political climate in the region).\n\n> N.B.: All of the above-mentioned use-cases are, of course, just a few examples\nof  what a private, decentralized, and two-party escrow makes possible. We hear\nof buyers and sellers with different reasons and benefits that they draw from\nthis system every week, and we’re sure we will continue to hear of new ones as\nadoption of this novel system grows!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn Uncompromising Alternative to Traditional Market Settlements\nA two-party escrow system is unusual and involves a level of commitment that\nsellers and buyers are not often accustomed to. However, as we've just seen, it\nalso comes with powerful upsides that facilitate commerce trades within a wide\nrange of use-cases — the highest of which, in our view, is making possible a\nworldwide, absolutely uncompromisingly open, free, private, and unrestricted\nworld market of goods and services.\n\nSuch a protocol is already a strong complement to traditional escrow models.\nBeyond that, we believe it is bound to hold as a soaring, paradigm-shifting\nalternative in a world where centralized payment processors and financial\nservice providers are becoming more restrictive by the day.

Let’s explore what this means for Particl Marketplace.</p><h2 id=\"common-issues-with-traditional-escrow-models\">Common Issues With Traditional Escrow Models</h2><p>With traditional escrow, a third-party (the escrow agent) holds onto an asset and releases it when the transaction is completed (i.e., the purchased item is delivered). That role is generally assumed by the marketplace or exchange itself (i.e., Amazon, Openbazaar), a payment processor (i.e., Paypal, Visa), or third-party escrow services (i.e., a bank or a financial institution). This allows potential disputes or issues to be safely settled, but it also carries important issues.</p><p>Firstly, running escrow or issue resolution services incurs a heavy cost reflected in the platform's fees. When added to every link of a supply chain, this fee ends up substantially impacting retail prices and making up a large portion of the final price of nearly all products we buy daily.</p><p>Additionally, when an issue arises, it is usually settled according to a very rigid set of policies rather than being dealt with on a case-by-case basis. This allows for more issues to be resolved quickly and efficiently but can also lead to biased resolutions that benefit the operator's own bottom line. In turn, scammers have perfected the art of defeating these hard-set policies to steal money, products, or both, from rule-abiding users and sellers. Online merchants are well aware of this problem and hedge their exposure to this risk through their prices, an unfortunate reality that the customer is ultimately led to bear the costs.</p><p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, these solutions offer no privacy at all to their users and incur intrusive data requirements due to the operator needing to be aware of every detail related to a single transaction to fulfill its role. This gives them complete oversight and insight over all the sensitive and, at times, confidential, personal, professional, financial, and commercial data collected from the platform's users — which they, in turn, can use in accordance with their interests, often to the<a href=\"https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/\"> detriment of the individuals and businesses using the platform</a>.</p><h1 id=\"particl-s-two-party-online-escrow-solution\">Particl’s Two-Party Online Escrow Solution</h1><p>Particl adopts a radically different escrow model which addresses the issues mentioned above. Often dubbed a “two-party escrow\", or \"MAD escrow\", it involves only two parties; the buyer and the seller, with no one else in between.</p><p>Instead of requiring a third party to hold the payment on behalf of two transacting parties, both participants are required to provide collateral by making an equal security deposit into a smart-contract. This security deposit can be adjusted from 0 to 100% of the total value of the item or service sold and is <strong>automatically refunded, in its entirety, once both parties mark the transaction as completed</strong>. Notably, this form of decentralized escrow is infinitely scalable, as there are no operating costs associated with running these types of cryptographically-enforced contracts and no escrow agents required for it to function.</p><p>If a dispute or issue arises, both parties need to mutually agree on a satisfying resolution for the transaction to be marked as complete. Because the two parties have a security deposit locked into the escrow smart-contract, they are naturally forced to collaborate and reach a reasonable resolution for both. <strong>This method of escrow allows the Particl marketplace to preserve the privacy of everyone involved in every instance.</strong></p><p>Another important but often overlooked advantage of two-party escrows involves sellers and cash flow. Although 2-of-2 escrow demands a security deposit, which may, on first thought, appear as a cash flow-inhibiting process, it is completely shielded from<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/01/paypal-stole-users-money-after-freezing-seizing-funds-lawsuit-alleges/\"> assets being frozen by entities like Amazon or Paypal</a> in the event of a dispute or perceived terms of use violations. Unfortunately, this is an extremely common reality for providers of services and goods on those platforms and can cause assets to remain in limbo for<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NootropicsDepot/comments/jyeeyh/will_there_ever_be_a_paypal_option_to_pay/\"> up to 6 months or even permanently</a>.

In other words, it incentivizes rational decision-making and simultaneously disincentivizes irrational/dishonest behavior.</p><p>To accomplish that desired outcome within the context of a two-party escrow system, Particl leverages the Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) game theory in a financial context. “MAD” is a military doctrine “<em>based on the theory of deterrence, which stipulates that the threat of using strong weapons against the enemy prevents the enemy’s use of those same weapons.

anonymity in\ncryptocurrencies and decentralized systems, we share our thoughts on the purpose\nof privacy in decentralized eCommerce platforms, specifically with regards to\nprotecting user safety and data sovereignty.\n\nA Brief Reminder of Bitcoin’s History\nNearly two decades ago, Bitcoin was introduced as a digital currency aiming to\nprovide financial freedom and personal sovereignty globally, irrespective of\none's background or circumstances.\n\nAnd while it spawned an incredible revolution, both in technological progress\nand online discourse, the proposed solution unfortunately fell short of\naccomplishing its stated mission.\n\nAn Unfortunate Reality\nContrary to early assumptions, Bitcoin transactions are far from private. In\nfact, they often fare worse than traditional fiat currencies in preserving\nfinancial confidentiality. Indeed, fiat systems typically handle fund transfers\nthrough secured channels designed to safeguard users' financial data from\nunauthorized public exposure.\n\nIn stark contrast, all Bitcoin transactions are permanently recorded on a public\nledger, openly exposing the entirety of one's financial details to any curious\nobserver. While Bitcoin's pseudonymous nature may foster a sense of anonymity in\nlimited contexts, this perception is increasingly recognized as a dangerous\nillusion.\n\nIn fact, transaction tracing capabilities have advanced significantly in the\npast few years, driven in part by regulatory requirements like\nKnow-Your-Customer (KYC) compliance that have necessitated increased transaction\nmonitoring by financial services.\n\nHistorically, only regulatory bodies and financial institutions had access to\ndetailed reports of users' on-chain financial histories through partnerships\nwith blockchain analytics firms however, the ability to effectively deanonymize\ntransactions and map them to real-world identities is rapidly proliferating to\nnew actors — most concerningly, criminals, hackers, and other malicious entities\nintent on exploiting this data for financial gain at the expense of unsuspecting\nvictims — thanks to the rapid evolution of large language models and artificial\nintelligence that have spawned widely accessible tracing protocols.\n\nThese escalating privacy vulnerabilities underscore the paramount importance of\ndeveloping robust privacy-preserving solutions for cryptocurrencies across the\nglobe, such as, among others, ”privacy coins”. Maintaining financial\nconfidentiality is not merely a luxury but an essential capability to safeguard\nusers operating in these systems.\n\nBitcoin and eCommerce\nHowever, when it comes to decentralized commerce – the logical evolution beyond\ndecentralized currencies – merely utilizing privacy coins is not sufficient.\nWhile on-chain transactions may be inherently private, the platforms\nfacilitating purchases and sales represent another significant attack vector\nthat must be addressed.\n\nAs regulatory obligations evolve, businesses operating centralized\ncryptocurrency platforms may be compelled to collect extensive user information,\nincluding transaction histories, associated identities, IP addresses, shipping\ndetails from buyers, sales data from sellers, and more. While one could\nreasonably expect regulatory bodies to handle such information responsibly, the\nsame assurances cannot be extended to the platforms themselves, as highlighted\nin our previous articles on the imperatives of privacy here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/] \nand here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-the-need-to-own-your-data-19bc31b0ec74/]\n.\n\nBut even if all platforms always acted in good faith, this centralized\naggregation of sensitive data becomes an enticing target for hackers and other\nmalicious actors seeking to exploit personal and financial information for\nillicit gains.\n\nThe Inherent Safety Risks of DeCommerce\nThe logical solution, therefore, is to develop an eCommerce platform that is as\ndecentralized as cryptocurrencies themselves. Such a platform would operate in a\npurely peer-to-peer manner, built upon a truly decentralized architecture devoid\nof single points of failure or centralized components. The objective is to offer\nservices akin to centralized eCommerce giants like eBay or Amazon, but without\nany central entity, thus eliminating the associated costs, fees, and frictions\ninherent to intermediaries. A \"decentralized online marketplace\", embodying\nBitcoin's ethos, and providing a clear user experience improvement over\ncentralized counterparts without data collection.\n\nHowever, while recent advancements in blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies\nenable such decentralized eCommerce platforms, they also introduce new\nchallenges in preserving users' financial data privacy and safety.\n\nPicture this scenario: You open a decentralized marketplace, hoping to purchase\na new computer online. You browse available listings from sellers worldwide and\nfind a suitable item. You proceed to add it to your cart and checkout, providing\nthe seller with your shipping address. Herein lies a significant safety concern;\nif you've paid using pseudonymous cryptocurrencies, you've likely revealed your\nphysical location alongside your entire financial history, including balances\nand past transactions.\n\nIn most cases, such disclosures may be innocuous, however, over an extended\nperiod, you or someone else may inadvertently expose critical details to\nmalicious actors, which could be used to identify and target the potential\nvictim. This risk vector is particularly concerning for high net-worth\nindividuals, as every purchase they make could effectively paint a target on\ntheir backs, making this situation simply unsustainable.\n\nCentralized platforms like eBay or Amazon typically circumvent this issue, as\npayments are facilitated through highly regulated centralized providers like\nPayPal, among others. While these entities face valid criticisms, they at least\navoid exposing users' complete financial histories on pseudonymous ledgers.\n\nHowever, a decentralized platform, by its very nature, does not rely on payment\nprocessors. Instead, it enables direct peer-to-peer trade between buyers and\nsellers. Consequently, an alternative solution must be implemented to preserve\nusers' financial privacy and security.\n\nThe Need for Privacy in DeCommerce\nParticl Marketplace addresses these concerns with its decentralized and secure\nonline marketplace, often touted as a privacy-first eCommerce solution. It\nensures user safety by providing robust privacy safeguards in two critical\nareas.\n\nTransactional Privacy\nFirst, it facilitates complete transactional privacy for counterparties through\nthe use of PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, which integrates advanced\non-chain privacy protocols. Two specific protocols are instrumental in\npreserving financial confidentiality: Confidential Transactions (\"CT\") and ring\nsignatures (\"RingCT\").\n\nCT transactions conceal the transfer amounts between parties, while RingCT\nobfuscates both transaction amounts and participant identities. However, RingCT\ntransactions lack programmable outputs, rendering them incompatible with\ndecentralized applications like Particl Marketplace. To address this limitation,\nRingCT inputs can be mapped to CT outputs, which possess programmable\ncapabilities. By chaining these protocols, Particl Marketplace effectively\nharnesses RingCT's enhanced privacy while facilitating seamless integration,\nproviding users with safety — which is otherwise entirely absent without\ntransactional privacy — and the assurance that their financial data remains\nconfidential during transactions.\n\nData-free Marketplace Activity\nSecondly, Particl Marketplace addresses the concerns surrounding excessive data\ncollection practices by centralized eCommerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, and\nEtsy, which have faced criticism for undermining user privacy. Some platforms\nhave even exploited user data to directly compete with their own sellers, as\nexemplified by AmazonBasics products and other Amazon sub-brands – an issue we\nhave previously explored in depth here\n[https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/].\n\nMoreover, while platforms claim to harvest data to enhance user experiences,\ntracking shopping habits can inadvertently expose sensitive information without\nconsent. A notable example is the Target pregnancy prediction case, in which an\nunsuspecting father learned of his daughter's pregnancy due to ad targeting – a\nscenario we’ve also previously discussed here\n[https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/].\n\nTo safeguard against such privacy infringements and data misuse, Particl\nMarketplace is designed to eliminate data generation, collection, storage, or\ndistribution entirely – encompassing both financial and non-financial metadata.\nAll marketplace activity data is stored locally, and all data transmitted (such\nas buyer-seller communications or shipping details) is conveyed through\nend-to-end encrypted messages via SMSG, a peer-to-peer data and messaging\nplatform (\"mixnet\") operating alongside Particl Core nodes\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/].\n\nThis privacy-first architecture ensures user safety and guarantees complete data\nownership and control, while preventing malicious data extraction through hacks,\nexploits, or the simple act of buying or selling online.\n\nConclusion\nWhile various accessibility, usability, and user-experience improvements are\nstill needed, the end result is a decentralized online marketplace that\neliminates fees and associated frictions inherent to third-party intermediaries\nwithin the eCommerce domain.\n\nHowever, beyond these benefits, it primarily serves as a secure platform for\ncryptocurrency users to engage in direct peer-to-peer trade without compromising\ntheir safety by exposing financial information to potentially malicious\nstrangers.\n\nAs we have aimed to clarify with this blog post, privacy in the context of\ncryptocurrency usage transcends a luxury or edge case. In scenarios such as\neCommerce/deCommerce, it is an absolute necessity to ensure the safety and\nwell-being of users transacting with unknown counterparties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

Such a platform would operate in a purely peer-to-peer manner, built upon a truly decentralized architecture devoid of single points of failure or centralized components. The objective is to offer services akin to centralized eCommerce giants like eBay or Amazon, but without any central entity, thus eliminating the associated costs, fees, and frictions inherent to intermediaries. A \"decentralized online marketplace\", embodying Bitcoin's ethos, and providing a clear user experience improvement over centralized counterparts without data collection.</p><p>However, while recent advancements in blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies enable such decentralized eCommerce platforms, they also introduce new challenges in preserving users' financial data privacy and safety.</p><p>Picture this scenario: You open a decentralized marketplace, hoping to purchase a new computer online. You browse available listings from sellers worldwide and find a suitable item. You proceed to add it to your cart and checkout, providing the seller with your shipping address. Herein lies a significant safety concern; if you've paid using pseudonymous cryptocurrencies, you've likely revealed your physical location alongside your entire financial history, including balances and past transactions.</p><p>In most cases, such disclosures may be innocuous, however, over an extended period, you or someone else may inadvertently expose critical details to malicious actors, which could be used to identify and target the potential victim. This risk vector is particularly concerning for high net-worth individuals, as every purchase they make could effectively paint a target on their backs, making this situation simply unsustainable.</p><p>Centralized platforms like eBay or Amazon typically circumvent this issue, as payments are facilitated through highly regulated centralized providers like PayPal, among others. While these entities face valid criticisms, they at least avoid exposing users' complete financial histories on pseudonymous ledgers.</p><p>However, a decentralized platform, by its very nature, does not rely on payment processors. Instead, it enables direct peer-to-peer trade between buyers and sellers. Consequently, an alternative solution must be implemented to preserve users' financial privacy and security.</p><h1 id=\"the-need-for-privacy-in-decommerce\">The Need for Privacy in DeCommerce</h1><p>Particl Marketplace addresses these concerns with its decentralized and secure online marketplace, often touted as a privacy-first eCommerce solution. It ensures user safety by providing robust privacy safeguards in two critical areas.</p><h2 id=\"transactional-privacy\">Transactional Privacy</h2><p>First, it facilitates complete transactional privacy for counterparties through the use of PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, which integrates advanced on-chain privacy protocols. Two specific protocols are instrumental in preserving financial confidentiality: Confidential Transactions (\"CT\") and ring signatures (\"RingCT\").</p><p>CT transactions conceal the transfer amounts between parties, while RingCT obfuscates both transaction amounts and participant identities. However, RingCT transactions lack programmable outputs, rendering them incompatible with decentralized applications like Particl Marketplace. To address this limitation, RingCT inputs can be mapped to CT outputs, which possess programmable capabilities. By chaining these protocols, Particl Marketplace effectively harnesses RingCT's enhanced privacy while facilitating seamless integration, providing users with safety — which is otherwise entirely absent without transactional privacy — and the assurance that their financial data remains confidential during transactions.</p><h2 id=\"data-free-marketplace-activity\">Data-free Marketplace Activity</h2><p>Secondly, Particl Marketplace addresses the concerns surrounding excessive data collection practices by centralized eCommerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, and Etsy, which have faced criticism for undermining user privacy. Some platforms have even exploited user data to directly compete with their own sellers, as exemplified by AmazonBasics products and other Amazon sub-brands – an issue we have previously explored in depth <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/\">here</a></strong>.</p><p>Moreover, while platforms claim to harvest data to enhance user experiences, tracking shopping habits can inadvertently expose sensitive information without consent. A notable example is the Target pregnancy prediction case, in which an unsuspecting father learned of his daughter's pregnancy due to ad targeting – a scenario we’ve also previously discussed <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/\">here</a></strong>.</p><p>To safeguard against such privacy infringements and data misuse, Particl Marketplace is designed to eliminate data generation, collection, storage, or distribution entirely – encompassing both financial and non-financial metadata. All marketplace activity data is stored locally, and all data transmitted (such as buyer-seller communications or shipping details) is conveyed through end-to-end encrypted messages via SMSG, <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\">a peer-to-peer data and messaging platform (\"mixnet\") operating alongside Particl Core nodes</a>.</p><p>This privacy-first architecture ensures user safety and guarantees complete data ownership and control, while preventing malicious data extraction through hacks, exploits, or the simple act of buying or selling online.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>While various accessibility, usability, and user-experience improvements are still needed, the end result is a decentralized online marketplace that eliminates fees and associated frictions inherent to third-party intermediaries within the eCommerce domain.</p><p>However, beyond these benefits, it primarily serves as a secure platform for cryptocurrency users to engage in direct peer-to-peer trade without compromising their safety by exposing financial information to potentially malicious strangers.</p><p>As we have aimed to clarify with this blog post, privacy in the context of cryptocurrency usage transcends a luxury or edge case.

for seamless and\npractical decentralized commerce solutions remains a driving force. Although\nthis is a self-evident use case for crypto, comprehensive solutions to use\ndecentralized money as money, without relying on heavily centralized\narchitecture, is lacking.\n\nWhile achieving this goal has proven challenging, this article explores how\nintegrating BasicSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) that offers Litecoin\npairs, into Particl Marketplace, a decentralized e-commerce platform, offers a\nsolution to overcome many user experience obstacles that have come to hinder the\nevolution of cryptocurrencies as a medium of payment.\n\nBy providing multi-currency support\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-integration-unlocking-currency-agnostic-commerce-on-particl/] \nto the decentralized e-commerce ecosystem, this upcoming integration offers a\ntangible path forward for many coins, unlocking the potential for widespread\ncryptocurrency usage in everyday retail transactions.\n\nWith this in mind, Litecoin, with its focused push as a payment currency, serves\nas the perfect candidate to illustrate this transformative potential, allowing\nanyone to use Litecoin for shopping.\n\nLitecoin; Faster and Cheaper Transactions\nLitecoin has garnered significant attention for its faster transaction times and\nlower fees compared to Bitcoin – a stark contrast to the latter's reputation for\nsluggish and costly processing. This, from the beginning, has positioned\nLitecoin as an ideal cryptocurrency for payments and commerce. Recognizing its\nstrengths in speed and affordability, the Litecoin community has been actively\npromoting its adoption as a practical and viable payment solution for years now.\n\nLitecoin MWEB and Privacy: Solidifying Litecoin as True Digital Cash\nLitecoin's MWEB (MimbleWimble Extension Blocks) introduces a significant\nimprovement to an already payment-friendly digital currency: transactional\nprivacy. This brings confidential transactions and privacy features to the\nLitecoin network, a pivotal development poised to solidify its positioning as\ntrue digital cash and a viable currency for payments.\n\nPrivacy is, of course, a crucial aspect in the realm of digital payments, as it\nsafeguards users' and businesses' financial information and promotes fungibility\n– a fundamental characteristic of sound money.\n\nParticl Marketplace: Redefining Decentralized E-Commerce\nWhile transactional privacy is paramount, it is also crucial for the platform\nfacilitating such payments to uphold privacy as well.\n\nEnvision this scenario: you send a private payment using Litecoin MWEB or even\nMonero to purchase an item online. However, you later discover that this\nplatform has been collecting user data and subsequently fell victim to a data\nbreach, exposing your shipping information, shopping history, along with\naddresses and payment details to an attacker. An absolute nightmare, even if the\ninitial payment was conducted through a private transaction.\n\nThis underscores the fact that private payments alone are insufficient to\ncompletely safeguard your shopping habits and selling history. This fact stands\nas a premise for the design of Particl Marketplace.\n\nParticl Marketplace is a decentralized, privacy-focused e-commerce platform\nbuilt using blockchain and peer-to-peer technology. Unlike traditional\ne-commerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, Etsy, or Alibaba, Particl Marketplace\noperates without intermediaries, ensuring secure and private transactions\nbetween users, free from fees or restrictions. Buyers and sellers transact\ndirectly, benefiting from a two-party escrow system that protects both parties\nand keeps all trade information private to the involved parties only.\n\nUsing Litecoin for Shopping on Particl Marketplace Soon to be AvailableWhile the\nplatform's unapologetically decentralized nature and privacy features make it an\nattractive alternative to centralized e-commerce platforms (which often face\ncensorship, data breaches, and other vulnerabilities), it is currently limited\nto using PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, as the settlement currency. This\nis due to PART’s unique technology being an integral component in enabling some\nof the marketplace's unique features in the first place.\n\nBasicSwap DEX: Enabling Multi-Currency Payments\nLitecoin MWEB Balances and Conversions Live on BasicSwap DEXLitecoin\nMimbleWimble balances and balance conversions are now live on BasicSwap DEX, a\nfirst step towards full MWEB swaps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/litecoin-mweb-balances-and-conversions-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\nBasicSwap DEX is a decentralized exchange protocol and platform powered by\natomic swaps and SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a distributed data and\nmessaging protocol (often referred to as a “mixnet”). It offers a non-custodial\nand privacy-first trading experience, enabling trustless cross-chain swaps\nbetween different cryptocurrencies across various blockchains. And just like\nParticl Marketplace, it imposes no fees, restrictions, or data collection\npractices.\n\nAnd while it has always included Litecoin since its inception, it recently\nintegrated MWEB balances, paving the way for full MWEB swaps once Litecoin's\nupcoming core update — which will detect incoming Litecoin transactions using\nonly the viewkey without requiring the spendkey — goes live.\n\nTrade Litecoin on BasicSwap DEX (Litecoin DEX)By integrating BasicSwap into\nParticl Marketplace, alternative payment options are introduced at the time of\ncheckout, allowing users to seamlessly pay for items using their preferred\ncryptocurrency, a prime candidate of which being the fast and private Litecoin\nMWEB token.\n\nThis synergy aligns perfectly with Litecoin's vision of becoming a viable and\npractical form of digital cash, providing an additional real-world use case that\nfurther solidifies its position.\n\nBuilding Bridges Between Cryptocurrencies\nThe upcoming integration of BasicSwap and Litecoin MWEB on Particl Marketplace\nexemplifies BasicSwap's broader mission of forging bridges between diverse\ncryptocurrency communities and projects through its cross-chain functionality.\nThis synergy unites our efforts toward a shared vision of building a global\neconomy that prioritizes sovereignty and interoperability - the great promise of\ncrypto.\n\nBy enabling the use of Litecoin on Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap fosters a\nsymbiotic relationship that holds immense promise. Cultivating interoperability\nbetween the two ecosystems will accelerate the adoption of Litecoin as a\npractical, decentralized, and privacy-focused payment solution, while further\npositioning Particl as an enabler of financial activities beyond simple\npeer-to-peer transactions.\n\nIf you share this vision, we invite you to join the Particl and BasicSwap\ncommunity as we build towards a sovereign future and contribute to the mission,\nwhether through code or spreading awareness within the Litecoin community\nitself. As the economy is fundamentally a social phenomenon, every contribution,\nbig or small, propels us forward.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

This is the future\nof BasicSwap, the atomic swap-based decentralized exchange that promises to be a\ncornerstone of the Particl ecosystem, and a catalyst for the growth of\ndecentralized commerce.\n\nThe Particl Ecosystem: A Beacon of Privacy Against Fiat\nParticl, through a multitude of modular privacy apps, can be understood as an\necosystem designed to respect individuals’ rights, freedoms, and privacy without\ncompromise. \n\nAt the core of the Particl project is the Particl Marketplace, a decentralized\ne-commerce platform that allows buyers and sellers to transact directly without\nintermediaries. This platform is complemented by a suite of privacy-focused\nprotocols that enable users to conduct various activities without relying on\nthird-party service providers.\n\nHowever, as Particl seeks to establish itself as a truly independent and\nself-sustaining ecosystem, a glaring issue has been a lack of avenues for\ninteracting effectively with the Marketplace, and the accessibility shortcomings\nthis represents. \n\nUntil recently, users have had to rely on centralized exchanges or unprotected\nover-the-counter (OTC) deals to acquire PART, the native currency of Particl\nMarketplace settlements, which undermines the platform's core principles of\nprivacy and autonomy.\n\nBridging the Gap: Bringing Decentralized Commerce to All Crypto\nWhile BasicSwap currently functions as an open-source decentralized exchange\napplication designed to facilitate trustless and anonymous trading of digital\nassets for all, its essence transcends that of a mere application; it is\nprimarily a protocol. This distinction, though seemingly minor on the surface,\ncarries profound implications for the future usage and purpose of BasicSwap.\n\nBy integrating it with the Particl Marketplace, thus providing to it\nBasicSwap-powered swap services such as a multi-currency payment option during\ncheckout, it promises to bridge the gap between privacy and decentralized\ncommerce, enabling users to interact with the Particl Marketplace using their\npreferred currency, while seamlessly converting the payment into PART in order\nto interact with certain aspects of the marketplace itself, such as Particl’s\nunique two-party escrow system\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-marketplace/marketplace_escrow.html]\n. The end result is a smooth experience where customers can pay for items in\ntheir preferred currency, which is then converted into PART in the background,\nproviding value to both the end-user and the Particl community of holders.\n\nBenefits that Extend Beyond the Usefulness of Multi-Currency Payments\nOne of the key advantages of BasicSwap is its ability to leverage atomic swap\ntechnology, specifically adaptor signatures, to allow users to exchange\ndifferent cryptocurrencies privately and without the need for a centralized\nintermediary. This not only enhances user security, it also opens up new\npossibilities for inter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects\nand their unique benefits.\n\nImagine a scenario where you wish to purchase an item on the Particl Marketplace\nusing Firo, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that employs the Lelantus protocol\nfor anonymity. With BasicSwap, you can initiate the transaction by sending your\nFiro to a designated address provided by the DEX. \n\nThe coins are then \"burned,\" and the Firo redeem token is exchanged for\nanonymous PART using BasicSwap, which is then used to complete the purchase on\nthe Particl Marketplace. Of course, all of this would happen behind the scenes,\nthe end-user being left with an easy-to-follow and comprehensive user experience\nakin to choosing a “checkout option” on traditional marketplaces.\n\nThis simple act demonstrates the power of atomic swap technology, effectively\ncombining the unique benefits of whatever coin is used as the checkout payment\noption (Firo, Monero, Litecoin MWEB, etc) and RingCT (the privacy protocol used\nby PART) in a single transaction. \n\nBy enabling such inter-compatibility between privacy technologies, BasicSwap\nunlocks a world of possibilities for users seeking to maintain their financial\nprivacy while engaging in decentralized commerce.\n\nThe Implications of a Truly Decentralized and Agnostic Payment System\nWhile the focus of BasicSwap is on bridging privacy projects and privacy coins,\nits true potential extends far beyond this scope. By offering a truly\ndecentralized and agnostic payment system, the BasicSwap protocol opens the door\nto a wide range of use cases and possibilities.\n\nOne exciting prospect is the integration of stablecoins, which could provide a\nmore stable and predictable means of value transfer within the Particl\necosystem. This could be particularly beneficial for e-commerce transactions,\nwhere price volatility can be a concern when cryptocurrency is involved.\n\nMoreover, the potential for anonymous stablecoins, or of anonymous swaps of\nexisting stablecoins, raises intriguing possibilities for enhancing financial\nprivacy while maintaining the benefits of price stability. As the technology\nevolves, BasicSwap's agnostic nature positions it to seamlessly integrate and\nfacilitate the use of such innovative financial instruments within the Particl\nMarketplace and beyond.\n\nConclusion: A Cornerstone for Decentralized Commerce\nThe integration of BasicSwap with the Particl Marketplace represents a\nsignificant milestone in our journey towards financial sovereignty. By providing\na robust and decentralized platform for trading PART and facilitating\ninter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects, BasicSwap is\npoised to become a cornerstone of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nAs the world increasingly recognizes the importance of privacy and autonomy in\nfinancial transactions, platforms like Particl and BasicSwap are poised to lead\nthe way in fostering a truly decentralized and privacy-focused economic\nenvironment. \n\nWith its commitment to agnosticism and its ability to adapt to emerging\ntechnologies, BasicSwap has the potential to revolutionize the way we think\nabout decentralized commerce, paving the way for a future where individuals can\ntransact freely, securely, and without the need for trusted third parties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
