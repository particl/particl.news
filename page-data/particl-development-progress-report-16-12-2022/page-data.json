So let's quickly see what progress has been made in the past\nfew days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nThis week, we have made slower-than-expected progress on the last two remaining\nitems mentioned in last week's report\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-09-12-2022/] due to a\nseries of issues that are now fixed.\n\nAs such, we are still working on those items and expect to complete them in the\nnext few days. Once completed, we'll run a series of internal tests, which\nshouldn't take more than a few days, and then deploy the build on testnet. \n\nAt this time, we can report that we still expect the testnet build of Particl\nDesktop 3.3 to be released before Christmas time, although it is now unclear\nwhether the actual mainnet version of it will be available by then. As always,\nwe will keep you posted! \n\nRemaining Items for Particl Desktop 3.3\n 1. (In progress) A couple of general but minor tweaks and minor\n    improvements/optimizations need to be done, but they are negligible in terms\n    of effort to sort out.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As usual, we've been\nkeeping up with upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain\nParticl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version.

Please note that\n   this method is experimental and not entirely supported yet.\n * Added the ability for BasicSwap to resume, from the most recent point, the\n   download of a Bitcoin snapshot if the connection fails for any reason.\n * Fixed a bug related to Monero's integration, as discussed earlier this week\n   in the community's chat channel.\n * Added a subfee feature to make coin withdrawals easier (no need to manually\n   calculate fees). The feature is not yet integrated into the GUI but will be\n   as part of one of our upcoming GUI updates.\n * Begun working on a dark mode for the GUI.\n * Begun working on a \"simple\" mode for the GUI, in which the user interface is\n   slimmed down and the more advanced options are not displayed.

We are already done with Linux machines,\n    but still need to test it up for Windows and Mac.\n 2. Write up the (rather massive and wide-ranging) changelog for Particl Desktop\n    3.3, which is no small update. \n 3.

This bug fixes a faulty behavior in which \"filtering by addresses\" wouldn't\nwork (would return nothing). This functionality is used by BasicSwap to allow\nyou to filter offers by the offerer. \n\nBasicSwap ?\nMore Private Swaps ?\nWe've added a new option that lets you select a more private atomic swap\nprotocol (adaptor signature swaps) for a variety of coins on BasicSwap. This\nadditional swap protocol, which uses scriptless scripts, is the same\nprivacy-first protocol that powers Monero and Particl Anon atomic swaps. It is\nnow also available for all coins that have integrated Segwit into their core.\nHere is the list of coins that fully support this privacy-first swap protocol:\n\n * Bitcoin\n * Litecoin\n * Dash\n * Particl, Particl CT, and Particl Anon\n * Monero (of course)\n\nThis new option is not yet available in the GUI but is ready at the protocol\nlevel. We expect it to be included in the GUI shortly into 2023 when we push its\nnext major update. \n\n> Note: While it is possible to swap Firo and PIVX using this more private\nprotocol, it is mandatory for the \"from\" coin to have Segwit enabled. \n\nIn other words, you cannot list a Firo or PIVX offer requesting another coin\nusing this improved protocol. To list a Firo or PIVX offer, you need to use the\nregular atomic swap protocol (Decred-style). \n\nYou can, however, use the more private swaps using Firo or PIVX by instead\npicking up an offer requesting these coins and swap using the more private\nprotocol if it is the swap type selected by the offerer (i.e., an offer offering\nBitcoin and requesting Firo). \nUser Interface ?️\nOn the side of the user interface of BasicSwap, we're still working on the items\nenumerated in last week's update with good progress being made on all fronts.\nThese items are as follows:\n\n * Integrating the new subfee feature to make coin withdrawals and offer posting\n   easier (no need to manually calculate fees) into the GUI.\n * Addition of a dark mode.\n * Addition of a \"simple\" mode for the GUI in which the user interface is\n   slimmed down. This aims at simplifying the user experience but still allowing\n   for more advanced options via a \"simple/advanced\" toggler. \n * Addition of a new price charting system. The current chart style will still\n   be available and it'll be possible to select which one you want to use via\n   the settings page.\n * Introduction of a wide variety of GUI improvements, tweaks, and changes based\n   on feedback from our beta testers.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

This functionality is used by BasicSwap to allow you to filter offers by the offerer. </p><h2 id=\"basicswap-\">BasicSwap ?</h2><h3 id=\"more-private-swaps-\">More Private Swaps ?</h3><p>We've added a new option that lets you select a more private atomic swap protocol (adaptor signature swaps) for a variety of coins on BasicSwap. This additional swap protocol, which uses <strong>scriptless scripts</strong>, is the same privacy-first protocol that powers Monero and Particl Anon atomic swaps. It is now also available for all coins that have integrated Segwit into their core. Here is the list of coins that fully support this privacy-first swap protocol:</p><ul><li>Bitcoin</li><li>Litecoin</li><li>Dash</li><li>Particl, Particl CT, and Particl Anon</li><li>Monero (of course)</li></ul><p>This new option is not yet available in the GUI but is ready at the protocol level.

To list a Firo or PIVX offer, you need to use the regular atomic swap protocol (Decred-style). <br><br>You can, however, use the more private swaps using Firo or PIVX by instead picking up an offer requesting these coins and swap using the more private protocol if it is the swap type selected by the offerer (i.e., an offer offering Bitcoin and requesting Firo). </blockquote><h3 id=\"user-interface-\">User Interface ?️</h3><p>On the side of the user interface of BasicSwap, we're still working on the items enumerated in last week's update with good progress being made on all fronts.

This is the\nitem we're currently working on at this very moment and we should have it sorted\nby tomorrow afternoon barring any unforeseen issues.\n\nThe second one is the updates/changes/cleanup of the Particl Core UI settings\nmodule (the page you get to when clicking on the Particl Core module on the\nwelcome/home page). We aim to get that sorted early next week. \n\nOnce completed, we'll run a series of internal tests, which shouldn't take more\nthan a few days, and then deploy the build on testnet. We are happy to report\nthat we are still on track with our goal of releasing Particl Desktop 3.3, on\nmainnet, before Christmas time! ?\n\nRemaining Items for Particl Desktop 3.3\n 1.

SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
