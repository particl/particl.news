Check out the link below to know everything about the massive\nParticl V3.0 update.\n\nStepping Things Up Again With Particl Desktop 3.0\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\nA New Breakthrough for Privacy and eCommerce ?particl.news\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nImproved Swap Engine Coming on V3 Release\nOne of the main components that’s getting a big makeover with the Particl V3\nrelease is the in-app swap engine. This module, which is available right inside\nthe Particl Desktop application, lets you easily swap other cryptocurrencies for\nPART so that you can anonymously buy or sell anything on the marketplace. This\ncan be done, without ever leaving the Particl Desktop client, by using the\nstandalone swap module which is currently being powered by partners such as \nStealthEX [https://stealthex.io] and SimpleSwap [https://simpleswap.io/].\n\nImprovements Through Better Bot Management Support\nTo explain more precisely what improvements Particl V3 will bring to the swap\nengine, Particl developer Arnold Bansemer takes the time to elaborate on the\ntopic.\n\n“The biggest part of the in-app swap engine changes is better bot management.\nBots will increasingly drive traffic onto the network and will end up playing a\nnon-trivial role in getting some external functionality into the Particl\necosystem.\n\nWhat we’re aiming to do with the ongoing changes being made to the swap engine\nis to create a set of defined functionalities and requirements for how bot info\nis received and processed which will push towards a standardized way of creating\n“legitimate” bots.\n\nUsing these requirements, the bot manager in PD will then effectively act as a\n“processing plant” for bots. The bot manager UI in the desktop will provide the\nuser with a way to manage different bots (add/remove/view details/etc). Other\napps (i.e. the marketplace) wanting to use a bot of a certain type, or provide\nbot management for a particular bot type, will interact directly with the bot\nmanager to obtain those details.”\n\nMore Robust Framework\nParticl developer Arnold Bansemer continues: “The bot manager will help ensure\nthat only those bots meeting a particular standard set of functionality are\navailable. For example, in the case of Particl’s swap module, it would only\ninquire about EXCHANGE type of bots and display the relevant information based\non context.\n\nWhen receiving a message on the bot listener address, the bot manager probes the\nbot to find out its commands, and argument types, etc. Once this is known\n(assuming we get valid data back), Particl apps (i.e. the marketplace) can start\ndoing all sorts of things like show upgrade changes, allow apps to use specific\nversions of bots, receive specific requests or data, and etc.”\n\nList of Swap Engine Improvements\nIn addition to the back-end changes being made to the bot manager, a few\nadditional improvements and goodies are being added to the swap engine itself.\n\nThe main improvements it’s receiving with the V3 release are as follow:\n\n * More coins being made available to swap\n * Completely new user interface\n * More dynamic and responsive process\n * More built-in security measures\n * Aggregated display of available offers\n\nThe sum of all these changes makes Particl’s in-app swap engine as smooth to use\nas ever. A special mention is worth giving to whoever pushed a prediction market\nSMSG bot onto the network a few weeks ago, prompting the Particl team to develop\na more robust and efficient framework for community bot management and\ndeployment.\n\nNew Coins Getting Listed on V3 Release\nParticl’s in-app swap engine (WIP and subject to change before release)To\nsupport the mainnet launch of Particl V3 along with its improved in-app swap\nengine, new coins will be added and ready to swap on the day of the release.\n\n * Monero [https://www.getmonero.org/] (XMR)\n * DAI [https://makerdao.com/en/] (MakerDAO’s stablecoin)\n * NIX [https://nixplatform.io/] (Flare Wallet)\n * USDt [https://tether.to/] (Tether stablecoin)\n * USDC [https://www.centre.io/usdc] (Circle & Coinbase stablecoin)\n\nThese coins not only make Particl as accessible as before by extending the\nnumber of cryptocurrencies that can be used on the platform, but they also\nprovide new valuable functionalities by either adding an additional privacy\nlayer (i.e. Monero) to the mix or by allowing stablecoin payments to be made\n(i.e. DAI).\n\nKeep an Eye Out for More Coins to Come\nThis is only a beginning. Following the Particl V3 mainnet release, new coins\nwill start getting added more regularly to the improved in-app swap module. This\nwill create a cascading effect of added utility, network effect, as well as\nincrease the pool of potential marketplace shoppers and sellers.\n\nThis will create a perfect storm scenario — the combination of (1) all the new\ncoins getting added to Particl, (2) the improved in-app swapping experience, and\n(3) the major impact on the overall user experience caused by the V3 release\nwill make it as easy as ever to get new people to try on Particl.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIs there any coin you’d like to see added on Particl?

This staking node can be hosted on any device, whether at home, on a VPS (cloud servers), or on any internet-connected device. Its only purpose is to stake on the network on behalf of other wallets.</p><p>Cold staking significantly improves the security of your funds when staking. Since you’re putting in charge an external node to do the staking, you can store your coins on any sort of device, online or off-line. That can be a cold wallet, a hardware device (i.e. Ledger or Trezor), a mobile wallet (Particl Copay or Flare Wallet), a multi-signature address, and etc.</p><p>If your staking node ever gets breached into or hacked, the attacker wouldn’t be able to steal any coin as the node itself contains no coin at all. All it’s doing is staking on the network using the weight of coins stored securely somewhere else.</p><p>To learn how to set up your own cold staking node, check out this tutorial: <a href=\"https://particl.news/guide-setting-up-particl-cold-staking-f5d9073bac4\"><strong>https://particl.news/guide-setting-up-particl-cold-staking-f5d9073bac4</strong></a></p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/guide-setting-up-particl-cold-staking-f5d9073bac4\"><strong>Guide: Setting up Particl Cold Staking</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/guide-setting-up-particl-cold-staking-f5d9073bac4\"><em>A Node, a Wallet and a Smart Contract</em>particl.news</a></p><h3 id=\"available-on-the-mobile-wallet\">Available on the Mobile Wallet</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Flare-Wallet-and-Particl-Partnership/1-l3np0Obe-MExR5hj9WjXzQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>In just a matter of days, Flare Wallet will be pushing a new update to its mobile wallet which will enable cold staking for Particl.</p><p>Don’t worry about the mobile data cost of staking.

This includes shirts, caps,\nhoodies, and some very special mugs.\n\nFor the occasion, there are some pretty sweet but time-limited deals going on!\nFirst come, first serve, so make sure to hurry up!\n\n * First 20 shirts are 1 PART, the next 80 shirts will only be $5\n * First 10 hoodies are 1 PART, the next 20 hoodies will only be $5\n * First 20 mugs are 1 PART, the next 40 mugs will only be $5\n\n> Get them while the deal lasts!\nA Perfect Match for Privacy Nuts\nThe most interesting aspect of topping up your Particl account using Zcoin is\nthe compounding effect gained from combining different privacy protocols\ntogether. Whether you’re primarily a Zcoin or a Particl user, you can\nsignificantly raise your level of privacy and security when shopping online with \nthis simple trick\n[https://particl.news/zcoin-gets-listed-on-particl-7dfcf0bf69d4#8c4c].\n\nDifferent Approaches to Privacy\nZcoin and Particl adopt fundamentally different approaches to privacy and\nanonymize cryptocurrency transactions in different ways.\n\nZcoin uses what is known as SIGMA\n[https://zcoin.io/direct-untraceable-anonymous-lelantus/] and will soon move to\nits evolved version —Lelantus\n[https://zcoin.io/direct-untraceable-anonymous-lelantus/]. It is a\nzero-knowledge protocol that basically burns coins and redeems them at some\nlater point without any trail of how it got there being visible. It also allows\ndirect anonymous payments by giving the “right to redeem coins” to someone else.\nThis privacy protocol completely breaks the traceability of transactions.\n\nParticl, on the other hand, doesn’t destroy and redeem coins. It instead uses \nRingCT [https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd] \nto mix coins with others and uses “decoys” to obfuscate the payment trail even\nmore. Because RingCT transactions are mandatory for all marketplace\ntransactions, it protects users not only with strong cryptographic privacy but\nalso credible plausible deniability\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption].\n\nBoth of these approaches (burning/redeeming vs mixing) have their pros and cons.\nFor example, Zcoin may break the traceability of transactions more definitively\nbut Particl allows for a lot of flexibility which is a must since its\nmarketplace relies on privacy-oriented smart-contracts. As always with this kind\nof technology, there is never a clear winner and neither should there be. So why\nnot mix both protocols and get the best of both worlds?\n\nBetter Together\nWith just a few extra steps, you can combine the benefits of both privacy\nprotocols and get a much better level of online privacy when shopping online.\n\nAll you need to do is to first make a private transaction on the Zcoin network,\nredeem your coins, and use them to top up your Particl account with Particl\nDesktop’s in-app swap engine. This same process can also be done when checking\nout your cart on the Particl Marketplace.\n\nSimply follow these steps:\n\n * On Zcoin, execute a private XZC transaction.\n * Redeem the coins into a public address (ideally in a fresh wallet for added\n   privacy)\n * Open up Particl Desktop and initiate an XZC to PART swap\n * Send the PART you’ve received from the swap to an anon balance\n * Shop online in total privacy (SIGMA + RingCT)\n\nFollowing this simple trick will significantly improve your privacy when\nshopping online. Tracing back the payment back to you would not only require the\nParticl network to be deanonymized but the Zcoin network as well.\n\nSince both protocols are so fundamentally different, RingCT and SIGMA zero-day\nexploits are less likely to affect both protocols at the same time. If one\nprotocol ever fails, you know the other’s protecting you as a backup!\n\n> Note: Protecting your transaction information when shopping online is just one\nstep of the giant puzzle. Particl also natively protects your online identity,\nsecure your communications, doesn’t collect or even generate any metadata about\nyou, and lets you hide your network identity (IP address).

It is the first to develop and implement the Sigma Protocol, which\nallows users to have complete privacy over their transactions via zero-knowledge\ncryptographic proofs without the need for trusted setup. Its research labs also\ncreated the Lelantus privacy protocol which has gained academic acclaim and set\nto go live on Zcoin in 2020.\n\nIn 2018, Zcoin made history by having the Thai Democrat Party’s elections held\non its blockchain with over 127,000 votes cast nationwide.\n\nAbout Particl\nParticl is a privacy-first and worldwide censorship-resistant eCommerce platform\nbuilt on blockchain and peer-to-peer technology. It restores the balance of\npower towards the individual, not corporations or authorities, by decentralizing\ncore aspects of today’s internet and economy.\n\nThe Particl Marketplace is a decentralized and reliable multi-vendor marketplace\nthat lets anyone in the world buy and sell anything, without leaving a trace. It\neliminates the problems of trust, personal data abuse, and enrichment of large\ncorporations. It preserves privacy at any time and enables a trading scope for\nunbeatable product pricing. Free of any third-party interference, it creates a\nfair level playing field.\n\nThe Particl coin (PART) is the native currency of the Particl Marketplace. It is\na privacy coin that offers strong but flexible data protection and privacy\ncapabilities using a combination of the Confidential Transactions (CT) and\nRingCT (with Bulletproofs) privacy protocols. It is the first coin built on the\nBitcoin codebase to ever make these protocols available.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLearn More About Particl\n * What to expect in Particl V3.0\n   [https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\n * All about Particl’s fundamentals\n   [https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/ffbzfw/particl_chart_prior_to_its_massive_update/]\n * Complete collection of useful links\n   [https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/pxu0py/getting_started/]\n * Join the community on Telegram [https://t.me/ParticlOn]\n * Join the community on Discord [https://discord.me/particl]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Zcoin-is-Live-on-Particl/1-w3OMndBq3t132yt3_iMkDg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"the-world-s-most-private-way-to-shop-online\">The World’s Most Private Way to Shop Online</h3><p><strong>Zcoin</strong> has been added to Particl’s decentralized marketplace and desktop application as of this <strong>6th of July 2020 at 3:00 PM UTC</strong>.

Whether you’re primarily a Zcoin or a Particl user, you can significantly raise your level of privacy and security when shopping online with <a href=\"https://particl.news/zcoin-gets-listed-on-particl-7dfcf0bf69d4#8c4c\"><strong>this simple trick</strong></a>.</p><h2 id=\"different-approaches-to-privacy\">Different Approaches to Privacy</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Zcoin-is-Live-on-Particl/0-ol1PadCGMr0x-hDg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Zcoin and Particl adopt fundamentally different approaches to privacy and anonymize cryptocurrency transactions in different ways.</p><p>Zcoin uses what is known as <a href=\"https://zcoin.io/direct-untraceable-anonymous-lelantus/\"><strong>SIGMA</strong></a> and will soon move to its evolved version — <a href=\"https://zcoin.io/direct-untraceable-anonymous-lelantus/\"><strong>Lelantus</strong></a>.<strong> </strong>It is a zero-knowledge protocol that basically <strong>burns coins</strong> and <strong>redeems them</strong> at some later point without any trail of how it got there being visible. It also allows direct anonymous payments by giving the “right to redeem coins” to someone else. This privacy protocol completely breaks the traceability of transactions.</p><p>Particl, on the other hand, doesn’t destroy and redeem coins. It instead uses <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>RingCT</strong></a> to <strong>mix coins</strong> with others and uses “<strong>decoys</strong>” to obfuscate the payment trail even more. Because RingCT transactions are mandatory for all marketplace transactions, it protects users not only with strong cryptographic privacy but also credible <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption\">plausible deniability</a>.</p><p>Both of these approaches (burning/redeeming vs mixing) have their pros and cons. For example, Zcoin may break the traceability of transactions more definitively but Particl allows for a lot of flexibility which is a must since its marketplace relies on privacy-oriented smart-contracts. As always with this kind of technology, there is never a clear winner and neither should there be. So why not mix both protocols and get the best of both worlds?</p><h3 id=\"better-together\">Better Together</h3><p>With just a few extra steps, you can combine the benefits of both privacy protocols and get a much better level of online privacy when shopping online.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Zcoin-is-Live-on-Particl/0-qYgCKKNSqU9R8obf.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>All you need to do is to first make a private transaction on the Zcoin network, redeem your coins, and use them to top up your Particl account with Particl Desktop’s in-app swap engine. This same process can also be done when checking out your cart on the Particl Marketplace.</p><p><strong>Simply follow these steps:</strong></p><ul><li>On Zcoin, execute a private XZC transaction.</li><li>Redeem the coins into a public address (ideally in a fresh wallet for added privacy)</li><li>Open up Particl Desktop and initiate an XZC to PART swap</li><li>Send the PART you’ve received from the swap to an anon balance</li><li>Shop online in total privacy (SIGMA + RingCT)</li></ul><p>Following this simple trick will significantly improve your privacy when shopping online. Tracing back the payment back to you would not only require the Particl network to be deanonymized but the Zcoin network as well.</p><p>Since both protocols are so fundamentally different, RingCT and SIGMA zero-day exploits are less likely to affect both protocols at the same time. If one protocol ever fails, you know the other’s protecting you as a backup!</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> Protecting your transaction information when shopping online is just one step of the giant puzzle.

Particl team is excited to announce that leading privacy coin Zcoin will be\nadded to Particl’s decentralized marketplace and desktop application on the 6th\nof July 2020 at 3:00 PM UTC. This will allow you to easily top up your Particl\naccount using Zcoin to privately buy anything on the Particl Marketplace. Zcoin\nis the first cryptocurrency, after Bitcoin, to be added to Particl as an\nalternative account funding option.\n\nAdding Zcoin to Particl provides the Zcoin community with a safe way to spend\ntheir Zcoin without any intermediary and without leaving any digital footprint\nbehind.

To learn\nhow Particl V3.0 is going to completely change the game, read this blog post\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813] \nabout it.\n\nStepping Things Up Again With Particl Desktop 3.0\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\nA New Breakthrough for Privacy and eCommerce ?particl.news\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\n\nTo discuss the release, Zcoin’s Project Steward Reuben Yap and Particl\nambassador Dr. Kap will get together for an onboarding talk that will be\npublished on Particl’s Youtube channel [https://youtube.com/particl] on the 6th\nof July at 3:00 PM UTC.\n\n> Note: All purchases made on the marketplace are ultimately settled in PART.\nThat’s because payments need to be secured by Particl’s two-party escrow\nsmart-contract.

Whether you’re primarily a Zcoin or a Particl user, you can\nsignificantly raise your level of privacy and security when shopping online with \nthis simple trick.\n\nParticl MarketplaceDifferent Approaches to Privacy\nZcoin and Particl adopt fundamentally different approaches to privacy and\nanonymize cryptocurrency transactions in different ways.\n\nZcoin uses what is known as SIGMA\n[https://zcoin.io/direct-untraceable-anonymous-lelantus/] and will soon move to\nits evolved version —Lelantus\n[https://zcoin.io/direct-untraceable-anonymous-lelantus/]. It is a\nzero-knowledge protocol that basically burns coins and redeems them at some\nlater point without any trail of how it got there being visible. It also allows\ndirect anonymous payments by giving the “right to redeem coins” to someone else.\nThis privacy protocol completely breaks the traceability of transactions.\n\nParticl, on the other hand, doesn’t destroy and redeem coins. It instead uses \nRingCT [https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd] \nto mix coins with others and uses “decoys” to obfuscate the payment trail even\nmore. Because RingCT transactions are mandatory for all marketplace\ntransactions, it protects users not only with strong cryptographic privacy but\nalso credible plausible deniability\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption].\n\nBoth of these approaches (burning/redeeming vs mixing) have their pros and cons.\nFor example, Zcoin may break the traceability of transactions more definitively\nbut Particl allows for a lot of flexibility which is a must since its\nmarketplace relies on privacy-oriented smart-contracts. As always with this kind\nof technology, there is never a clear winner and neither should there be. So why\nnot mix both protocols and get the best of both worlds?\n\nTogether’s Better\nWith just a few extra steps, you can combine the benefits of both privacy\nprotocols and get a much better level of online privacy when shopping online.\n\nAll you need to do is to first make a private transaction on the Zcoin network,\nredeem your coins, and use them to top up your Particl account with Particl\nDesktop’s in-app swap engine. This same process can also be done when checking\nout your cart on the Particl Marketplace.\n\nSimply follow these steps:\n\n * On Zcoin, execute a private XZC transaction.\n * Redeem the coins into a public address (ideally in a fresh wallet for added\n   privacy)\n * Open up Particl Desktop and initiate an XZC to PART swap\n * Send the PART you’ve received from the swap to an anon balance\n * Shop online in total privacy (SIGMA + RingCT)\n\nFollowing this simple trick will significantly improve your privacy when\nshopping online. Tracing back the payment back to you would not only require the\nParticl network to be deanonymized but the Zcoin network as well.\n\nSince both protocols are so fundamentally different, RingCT and SIGMA zero-day\nexploits are less likely to affect both protocols at the same time. If one\nprotocol ever fails, you know the other’s protecting you as a backup!\n\n> Note: Protecting your transaction information when shopping online is just one\nstep of the giant puzzle.

The Particl team is also opening up a \nvoluntary donation address for community members to support outreach\ninitiatives.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA Marketplace for Everyone\nCryptocurrency communities tend to be tribal by nature, but Particl has always\nstrived to be a project building solutions that everybody can benefit from. It’s\nin the project’s DNA. As such, Particl’s decentralized marketplace and desktop\nclient is designed to be able to accept a multitude of payment options, not just\nits native coin (PART).\n\nThe rationale for this inclusive approach is simple\n[https://particl.news/bitcoin-particl-building-an-independent-economy-together-b293e214a094]\n—privacy, security, reliability, and being able to buy and sell anything online \nwithout censorship, restrictions, interference, nor fees, should be made easily\navailable to everyone in the world and not be exclusive to one community only.\nThe technology exists and has been live for a while, what good would it do and\nwhat societal progress would it really trigger if it’s kept exclusive to a\nselect group of individuals?\n\nBitcoin Accepted Here\nWith this in mind, Particl added the ability to make Bitcoin payments\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0] as\npart of Particl’s marketplace checkout process and as a standalone swap engine\nin December 2019. This allowed anyone possessing Bitcoin to spend it anonymously\nand buy anything available on the marketplace using the world’s most popular\ncryptocurrency.

now been ten months since the first version of the Particl\nmarketplace — an open and decentralized marketplace — has been live on mainnet.\nSince August 2019, hundreds of sales have been made all around the world in full\nanonymity, without paying any fee, and without any intermediary. And it’s about\nto get much better with Particl’s coming massive upgrade!\n\nN95 Masks for Sale, Uncensored, on ParticlFrom masks and survival gears banned\non most online marketplaces during COVID-19 to video games, gift cards, physical\nBitcoin Casascius coins, hemp, or art, all kinds of goods are already being\nexchanged on Particl’s open marketplace. But imagine if you could now set up \nyour own marketplace or storefront and share it with who you want? What would\nyou sell?\n\nYou want to start a specialized freelancer marketplace? A public CBD shop? A\nprecious metal trading community? A private marketplace for Casascius and other\ncollectible coins? A place to trade NFTs without any risk of being scammed? A\nphysical crypto art marketplace to take out middleman fees? Or maybe you just\nwant to sell your Reddit account full of karma?\n\nThen you will love Particl’s next upgrade, Particl Desktop 3.0 (Multi-Markets),\nbecause it enables this, and much, much more than ever before.\n\nKeep reading for a detailed breakdown of everything Particl Desktop 3.0 will\nhave to offer!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDo you already know all about Particl? Then jump to straight to the Particl\nDesktop 3.0 Update section of this blog post.\n\nTable of Content\n * What’s the Particl Marketplace?\n * Its Evolution Since it Launched\n * A Completely New Marketplace and Desktop Application\n * Re-Writing Particl Desktop\n * Adding More Features Than Initially Planned\n * What’s New With Particl Desktop 3.0\n * Particl Desktop\n * Marketplace Improvements\n * More to Come After the V3 Release\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s the Particl Marketplace?\nParticl is an autonomous and decentralized marketplace protocol that allows\npeople to safely and privately buy and sell anything online without requiring\nany third-party to be involved. No payment processor, no marketplace operator,\nno bank, no moderator, no data miner, no nothing. Just you, the person you’re\ntransacting with, and a fully automated two-party escrow system to prevent\nscams.\n\nParticl’s Open Marketplace on Particl Desktop V2This total absence of\nthird-party involvement is completely changing the eCommerce game and is opening\nup a ton of possibilities that simply aren’t possible otherwise. It means that \nfor-profit companies are no longer required for two people to safely transact on\nthe internet. And because no single party runs the Particl marketplace, there is\nno one charging fees to pay for expenses and draw revenue. That’s monumental,\nespecially when you consider that online marketplaces typically charge 5% to up\nto even 50% for the services they offer. A fee that is naturally reflected in\nthe retail price of products and services sold on these marketplaces.\n\nAnd more than just that, Particl also enables this kind of peer-to-peer\neCommerce in a totally private and anonymous way. In fact, a mix of\nprivacy-preserving protocols such as RingCT, CT, stealth addresses, Tor,\nrock-solid encryption, and more, guarantees that you won’t leave any sort of\ndigital footprint behind when shopping or selling online.

Particl is data-free and thus, scandal-free!\n\n> Particl is, put simply, eCommerce 2.0. It is DeCommerce!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIts Evolution Since it Launched\nThe Particl team has pushed a lot of releases to the marketplace since its\ninitial mainnet release on the 12th of August 2019 (Particl Desktop 2.0.0).\nThese releases have seen the addition of several important features and a\nsignificant improvement in all components.\n\nHere are some of the main improvements and added features to the marketplace\nsince its release:\n\n * Questions and answers on listings\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-1-0-released-on-mainnet-1e84cc8716f3]\n * Product/inventory import\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-1-0-released-on-mainnet-1e84cc8716f3]\n * Bitcoin payments\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0]\n * SMSG bots (optional third-party services that can be enabled)\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0]\n * Bid cancellation\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-2-0-released-1a1324881cf8]\n * Listing fee reduction\n   [https://particl.news/adjusting-listing-fees-4b676e230601]\n * Settings [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-2-0-released-1a1324881cf8]\n * Many UI/UX improvements\n * Many marketplace codebase improvements\n * Many bug fixes\n\nThere is no doubt, the Particl marketplace has progressed smoothly along its \nroadmap [http://particl.io/roadmap/] since its mainnet release. It’s been\nsignificantly improved in performance and feel, and it has also received a bunch\nof new features that are now standard use for any Particl user today.\n\nA Completely New Marketplace and Desktop Application\nSince the release of Bitcoin payments\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0] on\nParticl (Particl Desktop 2.3.0) on the 25th of November, the team has been\nworking on its next major feature release (Particl Desktop 2.4.0) —Multi-Markets\n, or “Infinite Markets” as referenced by some in the community.\n\n> Multi-Markets in a NutshellMulti-Markets add the ability to create and join an\ninfinite number of user-created markets and storefronts on the Particl network.\nIt essentially upgrades the Particl marketplace by connecting it to a wide\nnetwork of user-created markets. This is a major item of Particl’s current \nroadmap [http://particl.io/roadmap/].\n\nInitially, Particl Desktop 2.4.0 was only intended to add the ability to create\nor join an infinite number of markets and storefronts, but since this new\nfeature required so much of the codebase to be changed, it turned into a great\nopportunity to make a major leap forward and as a result, became much bigger\nthan anticipated. Here’s why…\n\nRe-Writing Particl Desktop\nParticl Desktop is already a great cryptocurrency wallet. It looks good, feels\ngood, and does everything, and more, that you’d typically need from a crypto\nwallet. As proof, it has often been forked and adapted by other open-source\nprojects to serve as the main desktop wallet.\n\nBut it’s also starting to show its time. Keep in mind, Particl Desktop is\nalready almost three years old now and the team has acquired a lot of experience\nand knowledge since then.\n\nIt may have been ideal for a simple cryptocurrency wallet and early versions of\nthe marketplace, but it has started to show its limitations when tested against\nsome of the most ambitious features and functionalities of the marketplace such\nas multi-markets.\n\nAnd so, because multi-markets already required so much work to be done to both\nthe marketplace codebase and the desktop application, the Particl team decided\nto completely re-write both of them and take it up to the next level.\n\nAs such, all components of Particl Desktop and most of the marketplace codebase\nhave been significantly improved and are now supported by a new and much more\nmodern codebase.\n\nThis is why the next version of Particl Desktop will now be numbered as Particl\nDesktop 3.0.0 instead of 2.4.0.\n\nAdding More Features Than Initially Planned\nPreview of the Marketplace User Dashboard Coming to Particl Desktop 3.0Along the\nway of re-writing everything, it also became evident that some key features of\nthe marketplace initially planned for later on could actually be integrated into\nthe new codebase right away. This would delay the multi-markets release a bit,\nbut would ultimately save a lot of time further down the road and simplify the\nintegration of the new codebase into the desktop application. This is what the\nteam chose to do in a bid to always offer the highest quality around.\n\nFor this reason, the release of multi-markets has been delayed by a bit longer\nthan initially expected, but far from a delay, it’s given the team the\nopportunity to create a mindblowing product that will change the game of\ndecentralized online commerce.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s New With Particl Desktop 3.0\nParticl Desktop V2 is about to retire and the new kid on the block, V3, is\ncoming fast! More than just a number change, this release changes the entire\nback-end code of the desktop application and introduces several features. It is,\nquite literally, Particl’s biggest upgrade since its mainnet launch almost three\nyears ago.\n\nHere are just some of what to expect from Particl Desktop 3.0:\n\nParticl Desktop\n * A much lighter, faster, more responsive and modern desktop application\n * A modular approach and separation of wallets, markets, and the swap engine\n   into different and independent modules\n * All modules (including marketplace) enabled by default on first startup\n * Massively improved user interface and user experience, more intuitive and \n   user-friendly\n * An almost uncountable number of bug fixes, improvements, and tweaks to most\n   components of the wallet and marketplace (many thanks to all the Particl\n   community for the valuable feedback ❤ )\n * A complete overhaul of the in-app swap engine interface\n * SDK friendly desktop application\n\nMarketplace Improvements\n * Addition of a brand new marketplace user dashboard with advanced\n   notifications and quick access to the main sections of your account\n * Addition of multi-markets and the ability to create an infinity of markets\n   and storefronts\n * Addition of the Market Browser and the ability to browse and join any\n   user-created market or storefront. It’s also possible to promote markets in\n   the Market Browser.\n * Improvements to Question and Answers section of listings — easier access and\n   more comprehensive notifications\n * Addition of user identities and profiles\n * Addition of custom categories which can be set per market or storefront\n * Massive reduction in listing fees, will be reduced by more than 80% of\n   current cost. The cost of listing a product on Particl will then be well\n   under a cent worth of PART\n * Improvements to how Particl Desktop, the marketplace codebase, and the SMSG\n   network interact with each other\n\n> Note: Because the V2 and V3 versions of Particl Desktop and the marketplace are\nso radically different, listings won’t be compatible with each other’s version.\nIn other words, listings published on V3 won’t show up on V2, and vice-versa. Of\ncourse, it’s always possible to revert back to a V2 version of the marketplace\nto complete any outstanding order you may still have.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore to Come After the V3 Release\nThe V3 version of Particl will mark a significant step in Particl’s roadmap\n[http://particl.io/roadmap/] as it will cross off many of its items. It will\nalso serve as the trigger for many other initiatives to come to life.\n\nNew Coins to be Added\nOverhaul of the in-App Swap Engine Interface (Particl Desktop V3)After Particl\nDesktop 3.0 goes live, more cryptocurrencies will be added to the in-app swap\nengine. This will be the best time to show the world what Particl has been up to\nin the last few months and come out with a bang in various cryptocurrency\ncommunities.\n\nEncrypted Messaging System\nCurrently under development by DeMarkets.io [https://demarkets.io/], a\ncompletely distributed, private, and encrypted messaging system will allow you\nto communicate with anyone else in the world.

And because no single party runs the Particl marketplace, there is no one charging fees to pay for expenses and draw revenue. That’s monumental, especially when you consider that <strong>online marketplaces typically charge 5% to up to even 50% for the services they offer</strong>. A fee that is naturally reflected in the retail price of products and services sold on these marketplaces.</p><p>And more than just that, Particl also enables this kind of peer-to-peer eCommerce in a <strong>totally private and anonymous</strong> way.

Particl is data-free and thus, scandal-free!</p><blockquote><strong>Particl is, put simply, eCommerce 2.0. It is DeCommerce!</strong></blockquote><hr><h2 id=\"its-evolution-since-it-launched\">Its Evolution Since it Launched</h2><p>The Particl team has pushed a lot of releases to the marketplace since its initial mainnet release on the <strong>12th of August 2019 (Particl Desktop 2.0.0)</strong>. These releases have seen the addition of several important features and a significant improvement in all components.</p><p>Here are some of the main improvements and added features to the marketplace since its release:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-1-0-released-on-mainnet-1e84cc8716f3\"><strong>Questions and answers on listings</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-1-0-released-on-mainnet-1e84cc8716f3\"><strong>Product/inventory import</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0\"><strong>Bitcoin payments</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0\"><strong>SMSG bots (optional third-party services that can be enabled)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-2-0-released-1a1324881cf8\"><strong>Bid cancellation</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/adjusting-listing-fees-4b676e230601\"><strong>Listing fee reduction</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-2-0-released-1a1324881cf8\"><strong>Settings</strong></a></li><li>Many UI/UX improvements</li><li>Many marketplace codebase improvements</li><li>Many bug fixes</li></ul><p>There is no doubt, the Particl marketplace has progressed smoothly along its <a href=\"http://particl.io/roadmap/\"><strong>roadmap</strong></a><strong> </strong>since its mainnet release. It’s been significantly improved in performance and feel, and it has also received a bunch of new features that are now standard use for any Particl user today.</p><h2 id=\"a-completely-new-marketplace-and-desktop-application\">A Completely New Marketplace and Desktop Application</h2><p>Since the <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0\">release of <strong>Bitcoin payments</strong></a> on Particl (Particl Desktop 2.3.0) on the 25th of November, the team has been working on its next major feature release (Particl Desktop 2.4.0) —<strong> Multi-Markets</strong>, or “<strong>Infinite Markets</strong>” as referenced by some in the community.</p><blockquote><strong>Multi-Markets in a Nutshell</strong>Multi-Markets add the ability to <strong>create and join an infinite number of user-created markets and storefronts</strong> on the Particl network. It essentially upgrades the Particl marketplace by connecting it to a wide network of user-created markets. This is a major item of Particl’s current <a href=\"http://particl.io/roadmap/\"><strong>roadmap</strong></a>.<br></blockquote><p>Initially, <strong>Particl Desktop 2.4.0</strong> was only intended to add the ability to create or join an infinite number of markets and storefronts, but since this new feature required so much of the codebase to be changed, it <strong>turned into a great opportunity to make a major leap forward</strong> and as a result, became much bigger than anticipated. Here’s why…</p><h3 id=\"re-writing-particl-desktop\">Re-Writing Particl Desktop</h3><p>Particl Desktop is already a great cryptocurrency wallet. It looks good, feels good, and does everything, and more, that you’d typically need from a crypto wallet. As proof, it has <strong>often been forked and adapted by other open-source projects</strong> to serve as the main desktop wallet.</p><p>But it’s also starting to show its time. Keep in mind, Particl Desktop is already almost three years old now and the team has acquired a lot of experience and knowledge since then.</p><p>It may have been ideal for a simple cryptocurrency wallet and early versions of the marketplace, but it has started to show its limitations when tested against some of the most ambitious features and functionalities of the marketplace such as multi-markets.</p><p>And so, because multi-markets already required so much work to be done to both the marketplace codebase and the desktop application, the Particl team decided to completely re-write both of them and take it up to the next level.</p><p>As such, all components of Particl Desktop and most of the marketplace codebase have been significantly improved and are now supported by a new and much more modern codebase.</p><p>This is why <strong>the next version of Particl Desktop will now be numbered as Particl Desktop 3.0.0 instead of 2.4.0.</strong></p><h2 id=\"adding-more-features-than-initially-planned\">Adding More Features Than Initially Planned</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Stepping-Things-Up-Again-With-Particl-Desktop-3-0/1-QXCxonxyXy9kQzg7HQS_1g.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Preview of the Marketplace User Dashboard Coming to Particl Desktop 3.0</figcaption></figure><p>Along the way of re-writing everything, it also became evident that some key features of the marketplace initially planned for later on could actually be integrated into the new codebase right away. This would delay the multi-markets release a bit, but would ultimately save a lot of time further down the road and simplify the integration of the new codebase into the desktop application. This is what the team chose to do in a bid to always offer the highest quality around.</p><p>For this reason, the release of multi-markets has been delayed by a bit longer than initially expected, but far from a delay, it’s given the team the opportunity to create a mindblowing product that will change the game of decentralized online commerce.</p><hr><h2 id=\"what-s-new-with-particl-desktop-3-0\">What’s New With Particl Desktop 3.0</h2><p>Particl Desktop V2 is about to retire and the new kid on the block, V3, is coming fast! More than just a number change, this release changes the entire back-end code of the desktop application and introduces several features. It is, quite literally, <strong>Particl’s biggest upgrade since its mainnet launch </strong>almost three years ago.</p><p>Here are just some of what to expect from Particl Desktop 3.0:</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop\"><strong>Particl Desktop</strong></h3><ul><li>A much <strong>lighter</strong>, <strong>faster</strong>, <strong>more responsive</strong> and <strong>modern</strong> desktop application</li><li>A <strong>modular</strong> approach and separation of wallets, markets, and the swap engine into different and independent modules</li><li>All modules (including <strong>marketplace) enabled by default</strong> on first startup</li><li>Massively improved user interface and user experience, more <strong>intuitive</strong> and <strong>user-friendly</strong></li><li>An almost uncountable number of <strong>bug fixes</strong>, <strong>improvements</strong>, and <strong>tweaks to most components</strong> of the wallet and marketplace (many thanks to all the Particl community for the valuable feedback ❤ )</li><li>A complete <strong>overhaul</strong> of the in-app <strong>swap engine interface</strong></li><li><strong>SDK friendly</strong> desktop application</li></ul><h3 id=\"marketplace-improvements\"><strong>Marketplace Improvements</strong></h3><ul><li>Addition of a brand <strong>new marketplace user dashboard</strong> with advanced notifications and quick access to the main sections of your account</li><li>Addition of <strong>multi-markets</strong> and the ability to create an infinity of markets and storefronts</li><li>Addition of the <strong>Market Browser</strong> and the ability to browse and join any user-created market or storefront.

It means that <strong>for-profit companies are no longer required for two people to safely transact on the internet</strong>. And because no single party runs the Particl marketplace, there is no one charging fees to pay for expenses and draw revenue. That’s monumental, especially when you consider that <strong>online marketplaces typically charge 5% to up to even 50% for the services they offer</strong>. A fee that is naturally reflected in the retail price of products and services sold on these marketplaces.</p><p>And more than just that, Particl also enables this kind of peer-to-peer eCommerce in a <strong>totally private and anonymous</strong> way.

Particl is data-free and thus, scandal-free!</p><blockquote><strong>Particl is, put simply, eCommerce 2.0. It is DeCommerce!</strong></blockquote><hr><h2 id=\"its-evolution-since-it-launched\">Its Evolution Since it Launched</h2><p>The Particl team has pushed a lot of releases to the marketplace since its initial mainnet release on the <strong>12th of August 2019 (Particl Desktop 2.0.0)</strong>. These releases have seen the addition of several important features and a significant improvement in all components.</p><p>Here are some of the main improvements and added features to the marketplace since its release:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-1-0-released-on-mainnet-1e84cc8716f3\"><strong>Questions and answers on listings</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-1-0-released-on-mainnet-1e84cc8716f3\"><strong>Product/inventory import</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0\"><strong>Bitcoin payments</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0\"><strong>SMSG bots (optional third-party services that can be enabled)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-2-0-released-1a1324881cf8\"><strong>Bid cancellation</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/adjusting-listing-fees-4b676e230601\"><strong>Listing fee reduction</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-2-0-released-1a1324881cf8\"><strong>Settings</strong></a></li><li>Many UI/UX improvements</li><li>Many marketplace codebase improvements</li><li>Many bug fixes</li></ul><p>There is no doubt, the Particl marketplace has progressed smoothly along its <a href=\"http://particl.io/roadmap/\"><strong>roadmap</strong></a><strong> </strong>since its mainnet release. It’s been significantly improved in performance and feel, and it has also received a bunch of new features that are now standard use for any Particl user today.</p><h2 id=\"a-completely-new-marketplace-and-desktop-application\">A Completely New Marketplace and Desktop Application</h2><p>Since the <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0\">release of <strong>Bitcoin payments</strong></a> on Particl (Particl Desktop 2.3.0) on the 25th of November, the team has been working on its next major feature release (Particl Desktop 2.4.0) —<strong> Multi-Markets</strong>, or “<strong>Infinite Markets</strong>” as referenced by some in the community.</p><blockquote><strong>Multi-Markets in a Nutshell</strong>Multi-Markets add the ability to <strong>create and join an infinite number of user-created markets and storefronts</strong> on the Particl network. It essentially upgrades the Particl marketplace by connecting it to a wide network of user-created markets. This is a major item of Particl’s current <a href=\"http://particl.io/roadmap/\"><strong>roadmap</strong></a>.<br></blockquote><p>Initially, <strong>Particl Desktop 2.4.0</strong> was only intended to add the ability to create or join an infinite number of markets and storefronts, but since this new feature required so much of the codebase to be changed, it <strong>turned into a great opportunity to make a major leap forward</strong> and as a result, became much bigger than anticipated. Here’s why…</p><h3 id=\"re-writing-particl-desktop\">Re-Writing Particl Desktop</h3><p>Particl Desktop is already a great cryptocurrency wallet. It looks good, feels good, and does everything, and more, that you’d typically need from a crypto wallet. As proof, it has <strong>often been forked and adapted by other open-source projects</strong> to serve as the main desktop wallet.</p><p>But it’s also starting to show its time. Keep in mind, Particl Desktop is already almost three years old now and the team has acquired a lot of experience and knowledge since then.</p><p>It may have been ideal for a simple cryptocurrency wallet and early versions of the marketplace, but it has started to show its limitations when tested against some of the most ambitious features and functionalities of the marketplace such as multi-markets.</p><p>And so, because multi-markets already required so much work to be done to both the marketplace codebase and the desktop application, the Particl team decided to completely re-write both of them and take it up to the next level.</p><p>As such, all components of Particl Desktop and most of the marketplace codebase have been significantly improved and are now supported by a new and much more modern codebase.</p><p>This is why <strong>the next version of Particl Desktop will now be numbered as Particl Desktop 3.0.0 instead of 2.4.0.</strong></p><h2 id=\"adding-more-features-than-initially-planned\">Adding More Features Than Initially Planned</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Stepping-Things-Up-Again-With-Particl-Desktop-3-0/1-QXCxonxyXy9kQzg7HQS_1g.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Preview of the Marketplace User Dashboard Coming to Particl Desktop 3.0</figcaption></figure><p>Along the way of re-writing everything, it also became evident that some key features of the marketplace initially planned for later on could actually be integrated into the new codebase right away. This would delay the multi-markets release a bit, but would ultimately save a lot of time further down the road and simplify the integration of the new codebase into the desktop application. This is what the team chose to do in a bid to always offer the highest quality around.</p><p>For this reason, the release of multi-markets has been delayed by a bit longer than initially expected, but far from a delay, it’s given the team the opportunity to create a mindblowing product that will change the game of decentralized online commerce.</p><hr><h2 id=\"what-s-new-with-particl-desktop-3-0\">What’s New With Particl Desktop 3.0</h2><p>Particl Desktop V2 is about to retire and the new kid on the block, V3, is coming fast! More than just a number change, this release changes the entire back-end code of the desktop application and introduces several features. It is, quite literally, <strong>Particl’s biggest upgrade since its mainnet launch </strong>almost three years ago.</p><p>Here are just some of what to expect from Particl Desktop 3.0:</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop\"><strong>Particl Desktop</strong></h3><ul><li>A much <strong>lighter</strong>, <strong>faster</strong>, <strong>more responsive</strong> and <strong>modern</strong> desktop application</li><li>A <strong>modular</strong> approach and separation of wallets, markets, and the swap engine into different and independent modules</li><li>All modules (including <strong>marketplace) enabled by default</strong> on first startup</li><li>Massively improved user interface and user experience, more <strong>intuitive</strong> and <strong>user-friendly</strong></li><li>An almost uncountable number of <strong>bug fixes</strong>, <strong>improvements</strong>, and <strong>tweaks to most components</strong> of the wallet and marketplace (many thanks to all the Particl community for the valuable feedback ❤ )</li><li>A complete <strong>overhaul</strong> of the in-app <strong>swap engine interface</strong></li><li><strong>SDK friendly</strong> desktop application</li></ul><h3 id=\"marketplace-improvements\"><strong>Marketplace Improvements</strong></h3><ul><li>Addition of a brand <strong>new marketplace user dashboard</strong> with advanced notifications and quick access to the main sections of your account</li><li>Addition of <strong>multi-markets</strong> and the ability to create an infinity of markets and storefronts</li><li>Addition of the <strong>Market Browser</strong> and the ability to browse and join any user-created market or storefront. It’s also possible to <strong>promote markets</strong> in the Market Browser.</li><li>Improvements to <strong>Question and Answers</strong> section of listings — easier access and more comprehensive notifications</li><li>Addition of <strong>user identities and profiles</strong></li><li>Addition of <strong>custom categories</strong> which can be set per market or storefront</li><li><strong>Massive reduction in listing fees</strong>, will be reduced by <strong>more than 80%</strong> of current cost. The cost of listing a product on Particl will then be well under a cent worth of PART</li><li>Improvements to how Particl Desktop, the marketplace codebase, and the <strong>SMSG network</strong> interact with each other</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Because the V2 and V3 versions of Particl Desktop and the marketplace are so radically different, listings won’t be compatible with each other’s version. In other words, <strong>listings published on V3 won’t show up on V2, and vice-versa</strong>. Of course, it’s always possible to revert back to a V2 version of the marketplace to complete any outstanding order you may still have.</blockquote><hr><h2 id=\"more-to-come-after-the-v3-release\">More to Come After the V3 Release</h2><p>The V3 version of Particl will mark a significant step in Particl’s <a href=\"http://particl.io/roadmap/\"><strong>roadmap</strong></a> as it will cross off many of its items. It will also serve as the trigger for many other initiatives to come to life.</p><h3 id=\"new-coins-to-be-added\">New Coins to be Added</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Stepping-Things-Up-Again-With-Particl-Desktop-3-0/1-SJZ9GGOaE8vBgLhB82hyMw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Overhaul of the in-App Swap Engine Interface (Particl Desktop V3)</figcaption></figure><p>After Particl Desktop 3.0 goes live, <strong>more cryptocurrencies will be added</strong> to the in-app swap engine.

The Particl team, along with a few outstanding\ncommunity contributors, have been working tirelessly in preparation for the\nrelease of Particl’s biggest update to date: Particl Desktop 2.4.0 (Infinite\nMarkets). How does all that work translate into real-life?\n\n * A significantly bigger release than initially expected — more user-friendly,\n   more features, and a more efficient back-end\n * Groundworks laid for outreach at scale\n * Ease the community into marketing Particl at scale\n * Support sellers and help them recognize Particl as an additional sales\n   channel that can benefit their business\n\nNot only has development been progressing very well, but the last few weeks have\nalso been very instrumental in laying solid foundations that will make Particl’s\nadoption as easy as it’s ever been.\n\nIn this update, we’ll break down everything that’s been happening. It is also\nthe perfect opportunity to reveal a few surprises that have been in the works\nfor some time now. So get ready, because this Project Update is going to be a\ncool one!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Contents (Click Me!)\n * Development Update\n * More Frequent Updates\n * Particl Academy\n * New Official Website and Messaging Strategy\n * Vendor Onboarding Program\n * New Coins and Exchanges Coming Up on Particl\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDevelopment Update\nTo refresh your mind, here are the most noteworthy items that are going to be\nintroduced in Particl Desktop 2.4.0.\n\n * Listing fees reduced by 80% or more\n * Infinite Markets & Market Management\n * Identity Management and seller profiles\n * Significant performance boost\n * More lightweight Particl Desktop client\n * The marketplace now enabled by default on first startup\n * Various user-interface and user-experience improvements\n * (NEW) A surprise feature currently being integrated (roadmap item)\n\nIn the last Development Update\n[https://particl.news/development-update-02-03-2020-c907679ded8f], it was\nmentioned the new market codebase was mostly ready and going through various\nrounds of testing designed to find any issue within the code. Well, a LOT has\nhappened since then and there’s a lot to say about it, so without further ado,\nlet’s dive right into it.\n\nMarketplace\nNew Marketplace Overview Page (WIP)As you already know, the market codebase has\nbeen going through a major refactoring process since the last Particl Desktop\nupdate. And while the integration tests have been generally positive, they have\nhighlighted a few key opportunities to add more components and improve on the\nnew ones before going live.\n\nThe team has immediately started working on these items which are resulting in\nmore changes being made to the codebase. The end result will be a much more \nefficient and future-proof foundation that will make features better and\neasier/faster to integrate.\n\nIt will also translate in a much bigger update than initially anticipated.\n\nThese new changes are necessary for Particl to move forward and quickly tackle\nits roadmap. Case in point, it’s already enabling a few surprise features that\nwere initially planned for much later during Beta.\n\nIt’s unclear yet exactly how many of these surprise features will be ready in\ntime for Particl Desktop 2.4.0, but stay alert because you might be impressed at\nhow fast they’ll end up going live.\n\nFor now, what they are will remain a mystery, but watch out as they might be\nrevealed very soon in one of the now regular development updates (keep reading\nfor more info on this).\n\nParticl Desktop\nMarket Browser — Empty (WIP)As mentioned in the previous Development Update,\nParticl Desktop is also being completely re-written from scratch. That means all\nof its back-end code is now different and, quite frankly, much more modern than\nany previous Particl Desktop version. That means it will now look slightly\ndifferent, be more responsive, faster, lighter, and just overall better!\n\nThe progress made on the development of the new Particl Desktop client is\nactually quite far ahead. The codebase has been complete for a while now and the\n“wiring” of the front-end client to the back-end (the market codebase) is\nprogressing smoothly.\n\nTweaks and minor improvements to the user interface are still being made at this\ntime and will be ongoing up until the mainnet release of Particl Desktop 2.4.0.\n\nIn-App Swap Engine\nChanges have also been made to the in-app “exchange module” to easily allow new\ncoins and exchanges to be added or removed on the fly without requiring any\nParticl Desktop update. The update is currently being tested and the team is\nputting the final fixes to the engine.\n\nThese changes are mandatory for what comes next for Particl. Keep reading this\nProject Update to learn more about when new coins and exchanges will be added to\nParticl.\n\n> Note: For simplicity, Particl’s in-app “exchange module” is now going to be\nreferred to as the swap engine, or in-app swap engine.\nETA for Testnet Release\nWallet Overview Page (WIP)Since the last development update\n[https://particl.news/development-update-02-03-2020-c907679ded8f], a significant\namount of additional work has been accomplished by Particl’s developers and\nthere’s more left to be completed. That only means Particl Desktop 2.4.0 will be\na much bigger update than initially anticipated. It will be faster, lighter, and \npack many, many more features and functionalities.\n\nFor all these reasons, it’s difficult to estimate exactly how long it will still\ntake for the testnet build to be ready. As it stands today, internal builds of\nthe new Particl Desktop client, with the marketplace, are working well for the\nmost part. However, it may still take a few weeks before the testnet build is\nready for community-wide testing. This, of course, ultimately depends on how the\nvarious code testing rounds go.\n\nBut don’t worry, it only means good things. While it may take longer than\nexpected to see the release of this update, the many changes currently being\nmade to Particl will allow some of the roadmap items that were planned for later\nduring Beta to be integrated much faster. That means it will significantly\nreduce the time between the release of future feature updates and make the\noverall user experience of the marketplace better, something that definitely\nhelps with user adoption.\n\nSo hang tight! Every day brings us closer to the testnet release. This will be a\nmoment that will profoundly change the game for Particl, and one that might have\njust as much impact, if not more, as the first-ever mainnet release of the\nmarketplace.\n\nMore Frequent Updates\nIn recent months, the Particl team has made the decision to start developing\nParticl in private repositories to protect its work from copy-cats and scam\nprojects. What this means is that, while all of Particl’s released code is\npublicly available (minus the Particl Desktop client), the unreleased code is\nnow kept private.\n\nUnfortunately, it also means that it’s now almost impossible to track the\ndevelopment progress by yourself. Whereas Particl’s Github used to be buzzing\nwith activity, it is now pretty quiet…publicly quiet at least (remember, it’s\nthe calm before the storm!).\n\nFor this reason, and to strive for as much transparency as possible, Particl is\nnow going to start making more regular development updates. That’ll allow you to\ntrack the development progress more pro-actively and understand more precisely\nthe status of the project at any given time.\n\nThe new development updates will be published both here on Particl.news\n[http://Particl.news] and on the #Progress-updates channel of Particl’s Discord\n[https://discord.me/particl] server.\n\nParticl Academy\nLaunching during the Particl Desktop 2.4.0 testnet phase and prior to the\nmainnet release, the Particl Academy is a new documentation hub containing all\nthe information you’ll ever need on Particl from both a vendor’s and a user’s\nperspective.\n\nIt includes step-by-step user guides for everything, in-depth guides about some\nParticl’s core components, FAQs, troubleshooting, documentation, and all the \nbasic instructions to get anyone started with Particl in no time.\n\nMaybe more importantly, the Particl Academy is written in human language. Forget\nall the crypto technical mumbo jumbo, all that stuff is moving to Particl’s Wiki\npage. The Particl Academy is an easy to follow interactive user manual meant to\nexplain what is Particl and how to use it in a way that anyone can understand,\nregardless of their “technical level”.\n\n> Pro-tip: When it goes live, it would be well advised to always link to the\nParticl Academy whenever trying to get someone new to try or look into Particl.\nThat’ll allow them to quickly put the pieces together and get started in just a\nfew minutes!\nNew Official Website and Messaging Strategy\nParticl is refining its message using a three-pronged approach, and with that\ncomes a few changes to where new users usually get their first point-of-contact.\n\nThe Official Website\nIn the first place, Particl’s website is getting a significant overhaul both in\nterms of content, look, and purpose. More than just a simple refresh, the new\nwebsite will look and feel completely different and will now focus on the\nmarketplace.\n\nIn fact, the website is usually what people usually first come across when\nsearching for Particl. For this reason, it needs to quickly explain what Particl\nis and how it can make that person’s life better. This needs to be made as clear\nand straightforward as possible. The official website is all about what’s\nParticl and how it’ll make your life better.\n\nParticl Wiki\nIn the second place, all the technical and crypto-focused information will be\nmoved to the Particl Wiki to make room for a simpler and more effective message\non the website. That means Particl’s Wiki page now becomes the main place to get\nall the deeper technical information that crypto fans might usually be\ninterested in. The Particl Wiki is all about how Particl works and its\nunderlying technologies (blockchain, P2P, etc).\n\nParticl Academy\nAnd finally, the Particl Academy comes in as the third and final piece to the\npuzzle. It’s the informative hub, the interactive user manual. It contains all\nthe basic information and instructions required to use Particl to its full\nextent. It’s also written in a way that anyone can understand and is meant to\nmake onboarding new users a much easier task. The Particl Academy is all about\nhow to use Particl in a way anyone can understand.\n\nWith that strategy, it now becomes easy to redirect new people to the right\nplace depending on a few factors such as their technical level or what they want\nto do/know about Particl.\n\nThe bottom line is…this methodical separation of the messaging into three main\nplatforms will allow anyone in the community to spread the Particl word as\nefficiently as ever and see better results with fewer efforts!\n\nVendor Onboarding Program\nThe Vendor Onboarding Program (VOP) is a program designed to help make the\nprocess of onboarding new sellers easier and help them make their first steps in\nthe world of decentralized eCommerce. It also provides all the tools required\nfor anyone to actively participate in reaching out and getting new sellers to\njoin Particl.\n\nThe “VOP” has two main objectives.\n\n * To help and support new sellers getting started on Particl\n * To make it easier and more efficient for anyone to reach out to online\n   sellers\n\nTo help and support new sellers, the VOP will provide added benefits and perks\nto sellers who opt to register to the program. These include the funding of\nlisting fees, the promotion of markets and storefronts, access to VIP channels,\npersonalized support, more exposure within Particl’s community, and many more\nbenefits that will be revealed at a later time.\n\nAll of these benefits are pre-packaged into an easy-to-join program that can be\nlinked by anyone in the community. Combined with the Particl Academy, it\ncompletely takes away the burden of walking a new seller through the whole\nprocess of explaining what’s Particl, how it can benefit them, how to use it,\nwhere to seek for help, and etc. All that’s left for you to do is to find online\nsellers you think would be a good fit on Particl and point them in the right\ndirection (the Particl Academy and the VOP).\n\nUltimately, a better and more structured onboarding process only leads to more\nsellers joining the platform, which inevitably means more products and diversity\nof choice on the marketplace.\n\nMore details about the VOP and how it will all work will be shared shortly with\nthe community in a blog post of its own.\n\nNew Coins and Exchanges Accepted on Particl ?\nThe mainnet release of Particl Desktop 2.4.0 is an important milestone for the\nproject. It is the completion of a multi-year long vision that initially aimed\nat providing a decentralized, trustless, and private eCommerce protocol that\nallows anyone to create its own market. And with the new shiny Particl Desktop\ngoing live on mainnet, now will be the time to finally show off Particl to the\nrest of the world!\n\nAs such, after Particl Desktop 2.4.0’s mainnet release, Particl will start\nadding new coins and exchanges to its swap engine, opening the marketplace to an\nunlimited number of cryptocurrency users and communities. In fact, it will now\nbe possible to add or remove coins and exchange on the fly without requiring any\nParticl Desktop update.\n\nAre there specific coins that you would like to use on Particl? Or maybe you\nthink a specific cryptocurrency community might benefit greatly from\ndecentralized eCommerce? Now’s the time to start thinking and talking about it!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinally, we would like to thank the entire Particl community for all the recent\nefforts put into the many community-led initiatives and in spreading the word\nabout Particl. Let’s just say this, getting more people to try Particl is about\nto get a whole lot easier for everyone with everything that’s coming up,\nincluding Particl Desktop 2.4.0, the Particl Academy, the VOP, the new website,\nand etc. All of your efforts are about to reap more results! ?","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Project-Update--22-04-2020-/1-lUw_dvIR7xVR-IcTt2IZSw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"dev-updates-new-website-particl-academy-new-coins-and-more-\">Dev Updates, New Website, Particl Academy, New Coins, and More! ?</h3><p>In the past few weeks, Particl has been going through what can only be described as the “calm before the storm”.

Well, a LOT has happened since then and there’s a lot to say about it, so without further ado, let’s dive right into it.</p><h3 id=\"marketplace\">Marketplace</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Project-Update--22-04-2020-/1-eSMJ4GdGZvdIQnzPgCbNIg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>New Marketplace Overview Page (WIP)</figcaption></figure><p>As you already know, the market codebase has been going through a <strong>major refactoring process </strong>since the last Particl Desktop update. And while the integration tests have been generally positive, they have highlighted a few <strong>key opportunities to add more components and improve</strong> on the new ones before going live.</p><p>The team has immediately started working on these items which are resulting in more changes being made to the codebase. The end result will be a much more <strong>efficient</strong> and <strong>future-proof</strong> foundation that will <strong>make features better and easier/faster to integrate</strong>.</p><p>It will also translate in a <strong>much bigger update than initially anticipated</strong>.</p><p>These new changes are necessary for Particl to move forward and quickly tackle its roadmap. Case in point, <strong>it’s already enabling a few surprise features</strong> that were initially planned for much later during Beta.</p><p>It’s unclear yet exactly how many of these surprise features will be ready in time for Particl Desktop 2.4.0, but stay alert because you might be impressed at how fast they’ll end up going live.</p><p>For now, what they are will remain a mystery, but watch out as they might be revealed very soon in one of the now <strong>regular development updates</strong> (keep reading for more info on this).</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop\">Particl Desktop</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Project-Update--22-04-2020-/1-pHLB-RaXJ3c5SYFInHVx7w.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Market Browser — Empty (WIP)</figcaption></figure><p>As mentioned in the previous Development Update, Particl Desktop is also being <strong>completely re-written from scratch</strong>. That means all of its back-end code is now different and, quite frankly, much more modern than any previous Particl Desktop version. That means it will now <strong>look slightly different</strong>, be <strong>more responsive</strong>, <strong>faster</strong>, <strong>lighter</strong>, and just overall <strong>better</strong>!</p><p>The progress made on the development of the new Particl Desktop client is actually quite far ahead. The codebase has been complete for a while now and the “wiring” of the front-end client to the back-end (the market codebase) is progressing smoothly.</p><p>Tweaks and minor improvements to the user interface are still being made at this time and will be ongoing up until the mainnet release of Particl Desktop 2.4.0.</p><h3 id=\"in-app-swap-engine\">In-App Swap Engine</h3><p>Changes have also been made to the in-app “exchange module” to easily <strong>allow new coins and exchanges to be added or removed on the fly without requiring any Particl Desktop update</strong>. The update is currently being tested and the team is putting the final fixes to the engine.</p><p>These changes are mandatory for what comes next for Particl. Keep reading this Project Update to learn more about when new coins and exchanges will be added to Particl.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> For simplicity, Particl’s in-app “exchange module” is now going to be referred to as the swap engine, or in-app swap engine.</blockquote><h3 id=\"eta-for-testnet-release\">ETA for Testnet Release</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Project-Update--22-04-2020-/1-_4dOslujM4x53mDhARV_QA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Wallet Overview Page (WIP)</figcaption></figure><p>Since the last <a href=\"https://particl.news/development-update-02-03-2020-c907679ded8f\">development update</a>, a significant amount of additional work has been accomplished by Particl’s developers and there’s more left to be completed. That only means Particl Desktop 2.4.0 will be a much bigger update than initially anticipated. It will be <strong>faster</strong>, <strong>lighter</strong>, and <strong>pack many, many more features and functionalities</strong>.</p><p>For all these reasons, it’s difficult to estimate exactly how long it will still take for the testnet build to be ready. As it stands today, internal builds of the new Particl Desktop client, with the marketplace, are working well for the most part. However, <strong>it may still take a few weeks</strong> before the testnet build is ready for community-wide testing. This, of course, ultimately depends on how the various code testing rounds go.</p><p>But don’t worry, it only means good things. While it may take longer than expected to see the release of this update, the many changes currently being made to Particl will allow some of the roadmap items that were planned for later during Beta to be integrated much faster. That means it will significantly reduce the time between the release of future feature updates and make the overall user experience of the marketplace better, something that definitely helps with user adoption.</p><p>So hang tight! Every day brings us closer to the testnet release. This will be a moment that will profoundly change the game for Particl, and one that might have just as much impact, if not more, as the first-ever mainnet release of the marketplace.</p><h2 id=\"more-frequent-updates\">More Frequent Updates</h2><p>In recent months, the Particl team has made the decision to start developing Particl in <strong>private repositories</strong> to protect its work from copy-cats and scam projects.

What this means is that you can\nnow store, send, receive, and swap PART for any of the other available assets\nwithin Flare Wallet’s ecosystem. Flare Wallet is a non-custodial wallet, meaning\nthat their team doesn’t have access to your private keys at all, and is\navailable on both mobile and desktop platforms.\n\nFlare Wallet | Privacy Focused Cryptocurrency Wallet [https://flarewallet.io/]\nSecure privacy focused cryptocurrency wallet for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin\nand\nmany more.flarewallet.io [https://flarewallet.io/]\n\nTeamwork Within Privacy & Security Focused Projects\nThe addition of PART into Flare Wallet is an encouraging story amidst an\nindustry that has unfortunately turned increasingly “pay-to-play”. When one\nstand up Particl community member (thanks to CaptainSkywalker) reached out to\nthe Flare Wallet team, their team took the time to dive into Particl to see what\nit was all about. They then reached out to the Particl team with an interest in\nlisting the coin solely based on the nature (especially its focus on privacy and\nsecurity), vision, and constant development of the project.\n\nThe Flare Wallet team never asked for a listing fee or a portion of the supply.\nThey instead reached out simply to ask whether the Particl team would be okay\nwith getting PART added to their ecosystem and inquired about a few technical\nquestions.\n\nFor this reason, Cryptoguard opened up a donation bounty for any Particl\ncommunity member to show their appreciation to Flare Wallet’s approach to\nworking with other privacy and security projects, as opposed to straight up\nasking for a listing fee payment regardless of the nature of the project. At the\ntime of this writing, the donation address has accumulated a total of ~2,745\nPART and will be transferred, today, to the Flare Wallet team.\n\nThis also highlights how effective a community can be.

We’re all in\nthis together as a big family! ?\n\nFlare Wallet — One Solution for Atomic Swaps on Particl’s Marketplace?\nWhile Flare Wallet’s swap services currently work by leveraging third-party\npartners’ services (i.e. StealthEx), their team is actively working towards\nimplementing atomic swaps into their engine so that swaps conducted on their\nwallet would be entirely trustless (as in, no middleman required to execute a\nswap). This was a development both the Flare Wallet and Particl teams found very\ninteresting as it relates to Particl’s marketplace.\n\nAs it currently stands, Particl’s marketplace only accepts BTC (and of course,\nPART) through SimpleSwap [https://simpleswap.io], but it is entirely possible to\nadd more coins using many different swap services. That means that, once Flare\nWallet successfully pushes atomic swap style swaps in production, it could\neasily be integrated into Particl’s marketplace and Particl Desktop client.\n\nOf course, Particl’s Lead Core Developer and Cryptographer, Tecnovert, has been\nworking on his own implementation of atomic swaps, but as you already know,\nParticl has an agnostic approach to such services on its platform. An additional\natomic swap solution is very much appreciated as it would increase\ndecentralization ever more (in that case, by adding more options, thus making\nthe overall platform more resilient) and by bringing more volume and liquidity\nthrough Flare Wallet’s reach within their own community as well as the greater\ncryptocurrency community. After all, Flare Wallet is a relatively well-known\nwallet within the industry and has a good level of brand recognition.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore About Flare Wallet\nFlare is a multi-asset privacy focused cryptocurrency light wallet. All keys are\nmanaged locally and completely secured and encrypted by the end-user with a\nsimple 12 seed mnemonic phrase backup. There are no servers that manage your\nwallets for you — you control everything. We believe it is important to create a\nwallet interface that is both fashionable and simple to use while giving it as\nmuch power as possible. Being a multi-currency privacy focused wallet, it will\nalso include and focus on several privacy/security features:\n\n * Networking privacy: Flare will have the option of being routed through Tor\n   networking to give users the best possible network privacy when\n   sending/receiving/swapping.\n * Coin-Control support (after beta): Flare will give users the ability to\n   control their inputs for each transaction for coins that utilize UTXO sets.\n   Benefits of this will be outlined below.\n * Decentralized privacy swaps (after beta): Flare will allow users to swap\n   their coins within the wallet using decentralized methods while using the \n   NIX\n   protocol [https://nixplatform.io]to break the linkage between swaps.\n * Hardware wallet support (after beta): Being able to use your Ledger/Trezor\n   for supported coins within the wallet to ensure the highest possible asset\n   security.\n\nFor users who value their privacy, Flare will give the best support possible in\nany multi-currency wallet available. For users who are just looking for a secure\nwallet that supports/will support many popular coins for them to store their\nholdings, Flare will do just the job.

There is no third-party or\nintermediary operating it, running servers, or having any sort of special\ncontrol over its network. Instead, it uses a mix of P2P and blockchain\ntechnologies, meaning that it is exclusively run by its global community of\nusers that are running nodes. It is, in most ways, pretty similar to how P2P\ntorrent networks operate and is the reason why they can’t be censored.\n\nThe Open Marketplace is an equally decentralized application that’s built on top\nof the Particl network. It allows anyone in the world to securely buy and sell\ngoods and services, physical or digital, regardless of where they are located in\nthe world. The marketplace requires no sign-up, no personal information, no\nsubscription, and is free of use. And because it is entirely decentralized,\nthere’s no staff or support team to manage disputes between a buyer and a\nseller. But that doesn’t mean there is no system to keep both parties honest in\nplace.\n\nFurthermore, the Open Marketplace is completely private by default, meaning no\nidentifiable data can be linked to any of its users. Transactions are hidden on\nthe blockchain, images are stripped of their metadata, data exchange and\ncommunications are encrypted, and you can even connect the marketplace through\nthe Tor network. In other words, users of the marketplace are as anonymous as\nthe current privacy technologies of today allow you to be.\n\nTrusting the Other Party\nHowever, the combination of all the marketplace’s characteristics mentioned\nabove introduces a bit of an issue when it comes to trusting the other party\n(whether that be the buyer or the seller) when making a transaction on the\nmarketplace.\n\nOn traditional, centralized marketplaces, this isn’t the biggest of deals, at\nleast from the customer point of view. In fact, these platforms either have a\n“resolution center” in place or an escrow system where users can be assured that\nthe other party will behave honestly. And it works…in most cases\n[https://www.thestreet.com/personal-finance/education/top-ebay-scams-14781610].\n\nParticl, however, is entirely decentralized and private. That means there’s no\nstaff around to arbitrate issues and make sure all transacting parties are\nhonest between each other.\n\nSo then, how can you prevent the other party from not respecting their end of\nthe deal when their identity is private and when there is no central party that\ncan punish bad actors? Does the buyer send the payment first, and then hope his\nproduct arrives in a good shape, if at all? Or does the seller take the risk to\nship the item before receiving the payment? This all boils down to trust, and\ntrusting strangers on the web, especially when they use bleeding-edge privacy\ntechnologies\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd], has\nalways proven to be risky and, frankly, ill-advised.\n\nThat’s where Particl’s innovative dual deposit MAD escrow system comes into\nplay.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDual Deposit MAD Escrow System\nLike most marketplaces, Particl uses an escrow system to keep transacting\nparties honest. The major difference between Particl’s escrow system and the\nsystem used in traditional marketplaces, however, is the fact that it’s \ncompletely trustless, meaning you do not need to trust any party or intermediary\nto have the assurance that a marketplace transaction won’t turn sour. It’s also \nfree of use, private-by-default, and fully autonomous between the buyer and the\nseller.\n\nAn escrow that doesn’t require any staff to operate is groundbreaking. For one,\nit dramatically increases the privacy of all participants by ensuring that all\ntransaction details, account information, tracking numbers, conversations, and\nany other kind of exchanged data, stay private and only known by the two\ntransacting parties (the buyer and the seller). It also means there’s no outside\nparty looking to charge you fees for their services because there are no\nservices being offered to you by any intermediary (which would usually be the\nescrow agent or user support staff). Additionally, it heavily reduces friction\nand makes the escrow as scalable as the network itself can be. No need to keep\nhiring more staff as the platform grows, and no need to worry about moderators’\nschedules and availabilities unlike other decentralized marketplaces (i.e.\nOpenBazaar’s 3-of-2 escrow system, for example).\n\nSo how exactly is this even possible? How can two parties be honest with one\nanother without any third-party enforcing honesty?\n\nDual Deposits\nIn order to prevent any of the two transacting parties from behaving\ndishonestly, there usually needs to be a punishment or disincentive in place.\nTypically, on traditional marketplaces, this punishment will usually be the\nmoderator ruling against the faulty party, although that, too, can be skewed and\nscrew one of the parties unfairly (hint: eCommerce platforms will almost always\nrule in the favor of the buyer, not the seller\n[https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/dec/09/seller-beware-listing-ebay]).\n\nOn Particl’s Open Marketplace, that punishment/disincentive comes in the forms\nof dual deposits and game-theory.\n\nThe way Particl’s escrow system functions are simple, but it’s also pretty\neffective. In a nutshell, when making a marketplace transaction, both parties\n(the buyer and the seller) need to match, as a security deposit into an escrow\nsmart-contract, the value of the item being purchased by the buyer plus the\nshipping costs. This ensures both the buyer and the seller have equal skin in\nthe game. Then, once both parties confirm that the transaction has been\ncompleted satisfactorily, the security deposits are refunded back to each party,\nat no fee other than the regular cryptocurrency transaction fee.\n\nTo visualize this, let’s take the example of a customer purchasing an item worth\n$100 with $10 shipping costs. That buyer is going to put $220 in escrow — $110\nwhich is the payment of the item being purchased, including shipping costs, and\nanother $110 which is the security deposit that’s going to be refunded, in full\nand without any fee, at the end of the transaction. The seller, on the other\nhand, has to also match the security deposit of the buyer, meaning he will be\nfunding the escrow smart-contract with $110. And since the seller will be\nshipping an item worth $110 through the mail, shipping fee included, it means\nboth parties now have $220 on the line.\n\nWhile the funds of both parties are locked up in escrow, the seller is going to\npackage and ship the order. Then, once the buyer receives the package, he’s\ngoing to assess that no foul play has been involved, and then mark the\ntransaction as complete once satisfied about the transaction. Marking the\ntransaction as complete will refund the two security deposits, in full, to both\nparties.\n\nMutually Assured Destruction (MAD) Game-Theory\nThe reason why this works is simple, if either one of the two parties misbehaves\nor tries to screw the other party over, the other party isn’t going to mark the\ntransaction as complete, which essentially makes the other party’s security\ndeposit inaccessible. The only way for the other party to get his security\ndeposit back is to reach an agreement in such a way that both users will be\nsatisfied. Only then, will the unsatisfied party, now satisfied due to the\nagreed-upon resolution, mark the transaction as complete.\n\nThis dynamic is often referred to as Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction]. It is a well-known\nwar doctrine\n[https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2016/09/09/mutually-assured-destruction-game-theory-and-the-cold-war/] \nbased on game-theory. The theory stipulates that if two countries are in\npossession of nuclear weapons, they won’t use them against each other. The\nreason for that is pretty simple — if one country launches a nuke towards the\nother party, it is almost guaranteed that the other country will retaliate and\nlaunch a nuke as well. The end scenario is that both countries will essentially\nannihilate each other with highly damaging weapons. In other words, both\ncountries lose and get turned into dust, hence why this game-theory is called \nMutually Assured Destruction.\n\nThe effectiveness of that game-theory was on full display, in a real-world\nscenario, during the Cold War when both the US and Russia heavily threatened\neach other with nuclear warheads. Missiles were very visibly targeted at each\nrival country, but never was a nuclear attack initiated due to the fear of\nretaliation from the other country.\n\nHow Does That Theory Tie In With Particl’s Escrow System?\nParticl’s escrow is more of the same, only the game-theory doesn’t revolve\naround the use of nukes, but around financial losses. The important point to\nunderstand here is that the entire MAD game-theory revolves around the fact that\nif one party misbehaves, it has to be punishing for both parties involved, hence\nthe “Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)” part of the game-theory. With Particl,\nthat negative incentive is a net financial loss.\n\nIn fact, if both parties cannot agree on an outcome, they both won’t receive\ntheir security deposits back, incurring a net loss for everyone involved. That’s\nprecisely the reason why this game-theory forces parties to actively work\ntowards reaching an agreement on their own, without requiring any sort of\nintermediary to arbitrate the situation. If they don’t, they both lose funds,\nand no one wants that to happen. If they do reach an agreement, then they can\nsuccessfully complete a marketplace transaction without paying fees (except for\nthe usual cryptocurrency transaction fee) and without forfeiting any personal or\nbusiness-related data to any outside party or intermediary.\n\nThis model of escrow is not only empowering, but it’s also a safe bet that no\noutside party will have access to any of the information being exchanged between\nthe two transacting parties. This is a game-changer, especially for supply\nchains and sensitive business to business deals where none of the party involved\nwants a third-party to snoop in. There’s no account details being revealed to an\nescrow agent, no transaction history being looked at, no tracking number or\nshipping address being looked at, no conversation being logged, and so on.\nEqually as important, there’s also nothing traceable or identifiable being\npublicly written on the blockchain.\n\nPrivacy\nProbably the most powerful feature of this entire escrow mechanism is the fact\nthat all currency transactions are initiated using the powerful RingCT privacy\nprotocol. The escrow smart-contract itself works using the Confidential\nTransactions (CT) privacy protocol, but any incoming and outgoing transactions\nto it are done with RingCT. Check out this Particl Explained — Private\nTransactions\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd#52ef] \narticle for more details about how CT and RingCT transactions can be linked\ntogether.\n\nParticl Explained - Private Transactions\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd#52ef]\nAnonymous transactions, or Anon transactions, as referred to in Particl\nDesktop,\ntake privacy to the next level by not…particl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd#52ef]\n\nAnd because all transactions that occur on the marketplace have to go through\nthe escrow system, it means they’re all untraceable by design.\n\nThis ensures all marketplace transactions are fungible and as private as the\nnext one. It’s also a great way to grow the pool of private transactions (the\nnumber of RingCT outputs) that occur on the network, something that greatly\nenhances the quality of the privacy of the whole platform.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInterested in learning more about Particl, its platform, and its marketplace?\nMake sure to keep an eye close to Particl.news [http://Particl.news] for regular\nnews, updates, and similar educational material.

The important point to understand here is that the entire MAD game-theory revolves around the fact that if one party misbehaves, it has to be punishing for both parties involved, hence the “Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)” part of the game-theory. With Particl, that negative incentive is a net financial loss.</p><p>In fact, if both parties cannot agree on an outcome, they both won’t receive their security deposits back, incurring a net loss for everyone involved. That’s precisely the reason why this game-theory forces parties to actively work towards reaching an agreement on their own, without requiring any sort of intermediary to arbitrate the situation. If they don’t, they both lose funds, and no one wants that to happen. If they do reach an agreement, then they can successfully complete a marketplace transaction without paying fees (except for the usual cryptocurrency transaction fee) and without forfeiting any personal or business-related data to any outside party or intermediary.</p><p>This model of escrow is not only empowering, but it’s also a safe bet that no outside party will have access to any of the information being exchanged between the two transacting parties. This is a game-changer, especially for supply chains and sensitive business to business deals where none of the party involved wants a third-party to snoop in. There’s no account details being revealed to an escrow agent, no transaction history being looked at, no tracking number or shipping address being looked at, no conversation being logged, and so on.

The major difference between Particl’s escrow system and the system used in traditional marketplaces, however, is the fact that it’s <strong>completely trustless</strong>, meaning you do not need to trust any party or intermediary to have the assurance that a marketplace transaction won’t turn sour. It’s also <strong>free of use</strong>,<strong> private-by-default</strong>, and <strong>fully autonomous</strong> between the buyer and the seller.</p><p>An escrow that doesn’t require any staff to operate is groundbreaking. For one, it dramatically increases the privacy of all participants by ensuring that all transaction details, account information, tracking numbers, conversations, and any other kind of exchanged data, stay private and only known by the two transacting parties (the buyer and the seller). It also means there’s no outside party looking to charge you fees for their services because there are no services being offered to you by any intermediary (which would usually be the escrow agent or user support staff). Additionally, it heavily reduces friction and makes the escrow as scalable as the network itself can be. No need to keep hiring more staff as the platform grows, and no need to worry about moderators’ schedules and availabilities unlike other decentralized marketplaces (i.e. OpenBazaar’s 3-of-2 escrow system, for example).</p><p>So how exactly is this even possible? How can two parties be honest with one another without any third-party enforcing honesty?</p><h3 id=\"dual-deposits\">Dual Deposits</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained--Two-Party-Escrow-System/1-83zap8l7onknenEufi6rAg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>In order to prevent any of the two transacting parties from behaving dishonestly, there usually needs to be a punishment or disincentive in place. Typically, on traditional marketplaces, this punishment will usually be the moderator ruling against the faulty party, although that, too, can be skewed and screw one of the parties unfairly (hint: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/dec/09/seller-beware-listing-ebay\"><strong>eCommerce platforms will almost always rule in the favor of the buyer, not the seller</strong></a>).</p><p>On Particl’s Open Marketplace, that punishment/disincentive comes in the forms of <strong>dual deposits</strong> and <strong>game-theory</strong>.</p><p>The way Particl’s escrow system functions are simple, but it’s also pretty effective. In a nutshell, <strong>when making a marketplace transaction, both parties (the buyer and the seller) need to match, as a security deposit into an escrow smart-contract, the value of the item being purchased by the buyer plus the shipping costs</strong>. This ensures both the buyer and the seller have equal skin in the game. Then, once both parties confirm that the transaction has been completed satisfactorily, the security deposits are refunded back to each party, at no fee other than the regular cryptocurrency transaction fee.</p><p>To visualize this, let’s take the example of a customer purchasing an item worth $100 with $10 shipping costs. That buyer is going to put $220 in escrow — $110 which is the payment of the item being purchased, including shipping costs, and another $110 which is the security deposit that’s going to be refunded, in full and without any fee, at the end of the transaction. The seller, on the other hand, has to also match the security deposit of the buyer, meaning he will be funding the escrow smart-contract with $110. And since the seller will be shipping an item worth $110 through the mail, shipping fee included, it means both parties now have $220 on the line.</p><p>While the funds of both parties are locked up in escrow, the seller is going to package and ship the order. Then, once the buyer receives the package, he’s going to assess that no foul play has been involved, and then mark the transaction as complete once satisfied about the transaction. Marking the transaction as complete will refund the two security deposits, in full, to both parties.</p><h3 id=\"mutually-assured-destruction-mad-game-theory\">Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) Game-Theory</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Explained--Two-Party-Escrow-System/1-tTl1ler-His0SYeRgDSWCQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>The reason why this works is simple, if either one of the two parties misbehaves or tries to screw the other party over, the other party isn’t going to mark the transaction as complete, which essentially makes the other party’s security deposit inaccessible. The only way for the other party to get his security deposit back is to reach an agreement in such a way that both users will be satisfied. Only then, will the unsatisfied party, now satisfied due to the agreed-upon resolution, mark the transaction as complete.</p><p>This dynamic is often referred to as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction\"><em><strong>Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)</strong></em></a>. It is a <a href=\"https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2016/09/09/mutually-assured-destruction-game-theory-and-the-cold-war/\">well-known war doctrine</a> based on game-theory.

Then just CLICK HERE and\njump\nstraight to it! [https://particl.io/roadmap/]\nIn the past two weeks, we’ve taken a deep dive into Particl’s current status.\nWe’ve reviewed all of last year’s accomplishments for the project\n[https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819] and how its\nOpen Marketplace has evolved since being released\n[https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02] on\nmainnet in August 2019. If there’s one thing that’s for sure, it’s that Particl\nis moving full steam ahead!\n\nHowever, the marketplace’s level of adoption, compared to the overwhelming\namount of development the team puts into it, also highlights a very important\nfact — the cryptocurrency industry has matured to the point where getting\nblockchain products into people’s hands is now what matters, not just delivering\nnew and exotic code alone. Yes, your product is perhaps groundbreaking, but it\nneeds to be used by “real” people for it to be worth anything in the “real\nworld”.\n\nLuckily, that’s always been the vision behind Particl, so this shift in\nmentality from hype to real-world use-cases is precisely where the blockchain\nindustry needs to move towards for Particl to become successful.\n\nIndeed, the project’s current team [https://particl.io/team] and advisory board\n[https://particl.io/team] are composed of old-school crypto developers,\nlong-time online sellers, and veterans within the payment industry who see, in\nblockchain and distributed technologies, the opportunity to completely disrupt\nglobal eCommerce and dramatically improve it for all involved parties by taking\nout the need to do business through middlemen — something simply not possible\nwhen relying on traditional, web 2.0 technologies.\n\nIn other words, Particl was not formed and isn’t being developed because\nblockchain is the new cool kid in town. No, it’s because its novel technology is\nbound to have a profound impact on an industry (eCommerce) in dire need of\nimprovements.\n\nThe Path Towards a Greater Adoption of Particl’s Marketplace\nParticl’s Open Marketplace may be live on mainnet, but it’s still Beta software.\nFor that reason, it may still be rough around the edges, lacking a few features,\nor seem more complicated to use than your typical online marketplace. And that’s\nall normal — it’s nowhere near its intended first version (that comes after\nBeta).\n\nTo that end, four main reasons why people may not want to use the marketplace in\nits current form have been identified in a previous blog post\n[https://particl.news/the-way-forward-1fa903fff430].\n\n * Missing features\n * Required improvements on some features/functions\n * Required improvements on the marketplace’s performance and stability\n * Required improvements to the user interface (UI) and experience (UX)\n\nThe good news is…the marketplace’s adoption is not on the slow-side of things\nbecause it doesn’t provide any benefit over traditional online marketplaces, \nquite to the contrary\n[https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02#767d]\n. No, it’s rather simply because Particl isn’t “adoption-ready” yet.\n\nThat’s precisely with “making Particl adoption-ready” in mind that the Particl\nteam is proud to release, today, its new development roadmap for 2020 and\nbeyond! What’s scheduled to be improved? What features are planned to be\nintegrated? Just keep reading and that’ll be no mystery to you by the end of\nthis article!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe New Roadmap is Here!\nParticl’s new roadmap is designed with one goal in mind: eliminate the barriers\nto entry and make Particl’s Open Marketplace “adoption-ready”. In other words, \neach roadmap item is there for a very specific reason, which is explained in\ndetail in the Why? section of the roadmap.\n\nTo better plan ahead, it has also been separated into three different\ncategories, each representing a different “phase” of adoption: Core Features,\nInnovators and Early Adopters. Each phase targets different types of users and\nhas its own development requirements. To understand the categorization of items,\nit is important to first understand the “product adoption curve”. It represents,\nby user volume, the adoption curve of product throughout its lifespan.\n\nThe more roadmap items within a certain “phase category” are completed, the more\nlikely it is that its targeted users will start using the marketplace. It also\nmakes the onboarding process increasingly easier.\n\nBefore getting down to the roadmap itself, let’s highlight a few important\npoints:\n\n * The roadmap is not binding, meaning that items could be added, taken out, or\n   see their scope change at any time.\n * There is no timeline associated with the roadmap. It shows what the team\n   plans on working on in 2020 and beyond, but no deadline or ETA is provided,\n   at least for the moment.\n * The items, although separated in adoption phases, are not ordered in any\n   particular way. That means items near the top of the roadmap won’t\n   necessarily be delivered before items near the end of it.\n * The roadmap doesn’t include ALL of the items that have been discussed by the\n   Particl team due to the fact that some of them are more minor in scope. These\n   will be integrated on Particl Desktop from time to time in various releases.\n * While not specifically mentioned in the roadmap, general performance and\n   UI/UX improvements are expected to be included with most releases. This is an\n   ongoing process that will go on all throughout Beta and even after it.\n\nWithout further ado, let’s jump right into the new development roadmap for 2020\nand beyond!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCore Marketplace Layer / Key Features\nThis stage of adoption has been limited mostly to the core Particl community due\nto the product itself (the marketplace) being so early in development and\navailable features. It’s been a phase where the marketplace became reality, but\nstill lacked a lot of very basic features and required improvements to attract\nnew users. At that stage, the entire project is still considered experimental\nand probably even closer to an Alpha software rather than a Beta. Even though\nthe marketplace is live on mainnet, it is still very much a testing phase (and\nthanks to YOU for being part of this very early but immensely important phase ? \n).\n\nMore information about this phase can be found in previous articles that have\nrecently been posted on Particl.news (1\n[https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819], 2\n[https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02], 3\n[https://particl.news/the-way-forward-1fa903fff430]).\n\nThe key features here are the ability to create and join an infinite number of\nmarkets, the customization of your identities on those markets, and do all of\nthat for next to no fee.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInnovators Stage of Adoption\nIf you’re reading this, you’re part of the innovators. This adoption stage is\nwhen it starts getting interesting and when we see the first few blips of\norganic adoption. It is at this moment that new features and improvements will\nslowly start making the marketplace “adoption-ready” for the innovator type of\npeople.\n\n“Innovators” are people that want to keep up with cutting edge technology and\nhave generally strong aptitudes for technical processes. They are passionate\nabout new technology and want to be the first to try it. At this stage, users\nthat start using Particl are still considered “pioneers” as they are willing to\nignore some missing elements, contribute towards improving the project (i.e.\ngiving valuable feedback), and deal with more complicated flows that they know\nwill improve over time, but they are also the people that will kickstart\nParticl’s “closed-loop” economy by making real online commerce.\n\nIn the specific case of Particl’s Open Marketplace, this stage of adoption is\nlikely to attract cryptocurrency enthusiasts, privacy advocates, and\nparticipants of various niche industries in need of what Particl offers (because\nthey can’t find it elsewhere).\n\nThis phase is PACKED with deliverables, but here are some particularly\ninteresting ones:\n\n * The fine-tuning of the Escrow (rate, optionality, …)\n * The possibility to run decentralized private auctions\n * A messaging system between buyers and sellers\n * The development SDK (for developers)\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEarly Adopters Phase of Adoption\nAfter the innovators come the early adopters. As its name implies, early\nadopters are still early into the game but their numbers are considerably higher\nthan innovators.\n\nInstead of coming around due to the novelty of a platform or because they have a\nvery urgent need for it, they start using the platform because they see it as\nproviding them with a dramatic strategic advantage not possible to have on other\nplatforms and not yet leveraged by their competitors. These people have all\nsorts of strategic applications and are creative in how they will use new\ntechnologies to their end. They’re also somewhat tolerant ofrisks as they know\nthe rewards can potentially be a game-changer for them. Whereas innovators tend\nto be fine rushing in, testing out the platform, and help find its pain points,\nearly adopters expect a much more “adoption-ready” platform with as little\nproblems as possible (although they do expect the platform to not be 100%\nready).\n\nIn the specific case of Particl, this stage will likely attract the more\naggressive and opportunistic types of sellers and enterprises. This phase is\nmuch closer to being mainstream-ready, although it is not quite there yet.\n\n> Note: This section of the roadmap is preliminary. More items will be added to it\nas we inch closer to this phase of adoption.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinal Note\nIf you would like to help with Particl’s development and contribute to one of\nthe items within the roadmap, feel free to contact the team on any of the\nchannels available (Telegram, Discord, Riot, Reddit, etc) or by email\n[http://particl.io/team/].\n\nIf you would instead like to help out on getting new users onboard, then feel\nfree to contact Cryptoguard on any of the channels available (Telegram, Discord,\nRiot, Reddit, etc).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/New-Development-Roadmap-Released-/1-zT-RLkPxcPnGTA0LSE5X8A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"new-decade-new-way-to-do-ecommerce-\">New Decade, New Way to do eCommerce! ?</h3><blockquote><a href=\"https://particl.io/roadmap/\"><strong>Want to see the new development roadmap right now?

For that reason, it may still be rough around the edges, lacking a few features, or seem more complicated to use than your typical online marketplace. And that’s all normal — it’s nowhere near its intended first version (that comes after Beta).</p><p>To that end, four main reasons why people may not want to use the marketplace in its current form have been identified in a <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-way-forward-1fa903fff430\"><strong>previous blog post</strong></a>.</p><ul><li><strong>Missing features</strong></li><li><strong>Required improvements on some features/functions</strong></li><li><strong>Required improvements on the marketplace’s performance and stability</strong></li><li><strong>Required improvements to the user interface (UI) and experience (UX)</strong></li></ul><p>The good news is…the marketplace’s adoption is not on the slow-side of things because it doesn’t provide any benefit over traditional online marketplaces, <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02#767d\"><strong>quite to the contrary</strong></a>. No, it’s rather simply because Particl isn’t “adoption-ready” yet.</p><p>That’s precisely with “<strong>making Particl adoption-ready</strong>” in mind that the Particl team is proud to release, today, its new development roadmap for 2020 and beyond! What’s scheduled to be improved? What features are planned to be integrated? Just keep reading and that’ll be no mystery to you by the end of this article!</p><hr><h2 id=\"the-new-roadmap-is-here-\">The New Roadmap is Here!</h2><p>Particl’s new roadmap is designed with one goal in mind: eliminate the barriers to entry and make Particl’s Open Marketplace “adoption-ready”. In other words, <strong>each roadmap item is there for a very specific reason, which is explained in detail in the Why? section </strong>of<strong> </strong>the roadmap.</p><p>To better plan ahead, <strong>it has also been separated into three different categories, each representing a different “phase” of adoption: Core Features, Innovators and Early Adopters</strong>. Each phase targets different types of users and has its own development requirements. To understand the categorization of items, it is important to first understand the “product adoption curve”. It represents, by user volume, the adoption curve of product throughout its lifespan.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/New-Development-Roadmap-Released-/1-uesNdJ26A9l2Ee2aPJ8duA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>The more roadmap items within a certain “phase category” are completed, the more likely it is that its targeted users will start using the marketplace. It also makes the onboarding process increasingly easier.</p><p><strong>Before getting down to the roadmap itself, let’s highlight a few important points:</strong></p><ul><li>The roadmap is not binding, meaning that items could be added, taken out, or see their scope change at any time.</li><li>There is no timeline associated with the roadmap. It shows what the team plans on working on in 2020 and beyond, but no deadline or ETA is provided, at least for the moment.</li><li>The items, although separated in adoption phases, are not ordered in any particular way. That means items near the top of the roadmap won’t necessarily be delivered before items near the end of it.</li><li>The roadmap doesn’t include ALL of the items that have been discussed by the Particl team due to the fact that some of them are more minor in scope. These will be integrated on Particl Desktop from time to time in various releases.</li><li>While not specifically mentioned in the roadmap, general performance and UI/UX improvements are expected to be included with most releases. This is an ongoing process that will go on all throughout Beta and even after it.</li></ul><p><strong>Without further ado, let’s jump right into the new development roadmap for 2020 and beyond!</strong></p><hr><h2 id=\"core-marketplace-layer-key-features\">Core Marketplace Layer / Key Features</h2><p>This stage of adoption has been limited mostly to the core Particl community due to the product itself (the marketplace) being so early in development and available features. It’s been a phase where the marketplace became reality, but still lacked a lot of very basic features and required improvements to attract new users. At that stage, the entire project is <strong>still considered experimental and probably even closer to an Alpha software rather than a Beta.</strong> Even though the marketplace is live on mainnet, it is still very much a testing phase (<strong>and thanks to YOU for being part of this very early but immensely important phase ?</strong> ).</p><p>More information about this phase can be found in previous articles that have recently been posted on Particl.news (<a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819\"><strong>1</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02\"><strong>2</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-way-forward-1fa903fff430\"><strong>3</strong></a>).</p><p>The key features here are the ability to create and join an infinite number of markets, the customization of your identities on those markets, and do all of that for next to no fee.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/New-Development-Roadmap-Released-/1-G3wprVFhOP5UnX4RmcpZYQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><hr><h2 id=\"innovators-stage-of-adoption\">Innovators Stage of Adoption</h2><p>If you’re reading this, you’re part of the innovators. This adoption stage is when it starts getting interesting and when we see the first few blips of organic adoption. It is at this moment that new features and improvements will slowly start making the marketplace “adoption-ready” for the innovator type of people.</p><p>“Innovators” are people that want to keep up with cutting edge technology and have generally strong aptitudes for technical processes. They are passionate about new technology and want to be the first to try it. At this stage, users that start using Particl are still considered “pioneers” as they are willing to ignore some missing elements, contribute towards improving the project (i.e. giving valuable feedback), and deal with more complicated flows that they know will improve over time, but they are also the people that will kickstart Particl’s “closed-loop” economy by making real online commerce.</p><p>In the specific case of Particl’s Open Marketplace, this stage of adoption is likely to attract cryptocurrency enthusiasts, privacy advocates, and participants of various niche industries in need of what Particl offers (because they can’t find it elsewhere).</p><p>This phase is PACKED with deliverables, but here are some particularly interesting ones:</p><ul><li>The <strong>fine-tuning of the Escrow</strong> (rate, optionality, …)</li><li>The possibility to run <strong>decentralized private auctions</strong></li><li>A <strong>messaging system</strong> between buyers and sellers</li><li>The <strong>development SDK </strong>(for developers)</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/New-Development-Roadmap-Released-/1-wA-g5N96NVKj6gbEZ-DjYw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><hr><h2 id=\"early-adopters-phase-of-adoption\">Early Adopters Phase of Adoption</h2><p>After the innovators come the early adopters. As its name implies, early adopters are still early into the game but their numbers are considerably higher than innovators.</p><p>Instead of coming around due to the novelty of a platform or because they have a very urgent need for it, they start using the platform because they see it as providing them with a dramatic strategic advantage not possible to have on other platforms and not yet leveraged by their competitors. These people have all sorts of strategic applications and are creative in how they will use new technologies to their end. They’re also somewhat tolerant ofrisks as they know the rewards can potentially be a game-changer for them. Whereas innovators tend to be fine rushing in, testing out the platform, and help find its pain points, early adopters expect a much more “adoption-ready” platform with as little problems as possible (although they do expect the platform to not be 100% ready).</p><p>In the specific case of Particl, this stage will likely attract the more aggressive and opportunistic types of sellers and enterprises. This phase is much closer to being mainstream-ready, although it is not quite there yet.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> This section of the roadmap is preliminary.

✅\nOver the last few days, we’ve reviewed Particl’s past development\naccomplishments with a full 2019 development review\n[https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819] as well as a \nsummary of all the progress made on the Open Marketplace since its mainnet\nrelease\n[https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02].\n\nAs is pretty evident, the development of Particl’s Open Marketplace has been\npretty strong and consistent throughout 2019, but that’s really been the\nproject’s greatest strength ever since its launch in mid-2017.\n\nParticl’s 2019 Year in Review\n[https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819]\nThe Year the Dream Came Trueparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819]\n\nHowever, there’s one very important fact to consider — great development only\ntakes you so far. This isn’t early crypto anymore when innovative projects were\nrewarded with exposure and growth simply based on development accomplishments.\nIn reality, what the blockchain community is still looking for, even after all\nthese years, is the metaphorical “killer app”, that first blockchain product\nthat will significantly improve on something concrete and bring the masses on\nboard. In other words, it is looking for blockchain to cause a paradigm shift.\n\nIn fact, the crypto community has more or less “seen it all”, especially\nconsidering the large number of projects that have fundraised millions of\ndollars based on bold promises but haven’t delivered a single thing yet. And\neven those projects that have delivered live blockchain products have seen very\nlittle adoption from anyone outside the few crypto hobbyists. The reason for\nthat is actually pretty simple — crypto’s “killer app” is still missing and\nnowhere to be found.\n\n“Isn’t Particl THE Killer App”?\nWith that in mind, many within Particl’s community would be fast to point out\nthat Particl’s Open Marketplace is just that — crypto’s killer app. After all,\nit offers a LOT of benefits that simply cannot, by design, be offered by the\nmore traditional online marketplaces currently in existence…and that’s all\nthanks to blockchain and distributed technologies. It charges no commission and \nbarely any fee at all, is inherently private by default, provably secures your\ndata by completely getting rid of third-parties, requires no sign-up, no login, \nno personal or business information, is censorship-proof, free to use, and works\nfrom anywhere in the world as long as you can connect to the internet. In fewer\nwords, it completely redefines the very nature of eCommerce by taking it through\nthe evolutionary path and making it much better. And that simply wouldn’t be\npossible without blockchain and the other novel distributed technologies\nemployed by the Particl platform.\n\nSo why isn’t Particl getting more adoption? Why isn’t Particl the new hot\nmarketplace on the web? To understand why that is, it is important to look at it\nfrom a different perspective, one that’s not coming from a hardcore\ncryptocurrency enthusiast.\n\nThis is precisely what this article is going to breakdown. What are the\nmarketplace’s current pain points? What are some of its obstacles to adoption\nstill standing to this day? How can these be fixed or eliminated so that any\neffort towards user adoption starts yielding positive results? Get prepared,\nbecause this is the last blog post before Particl’s reveal of the new\ndevelopment roadmap. This article is intended to give the precise reasoning\nbehind the roadmap’s visions and will explain the team’s strategy moving\nforward, WITH adoption in mind. Now let’s get to it!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s the Marketplace’s Current Stage of Development?\nWarning Banner Header on Particl DesktopBefore getting into the finer details,\nwe first need to understand a very important fact — Particl’s Open Marketplace\nis still in its Beta phase, meaning it is still early software that’s in its\ntesting/development phase. It is not a final product, far from that, and that’s\ntrue even though it is currently running on mainnet.\n\nWhile Particl Desktop is certainly one of the most appealing crypto wallets out\nthere, and while the Open Marketplace itself is pretty impressive for a live\nblockchain product, it is still missing key features intended for its final\nversion. It is also relatively complex to use for most people (in this case,\nthink in terms of “non-crypto users”), both of which make adoption a real\nchallenge.\n\nThat, alone, explains the marketplace’s relatively low level of adoption\ncompared to traditional online marketplaces. Particl’s current users can still\ndefinitely be considered as pioneers, and perhaps still at this point, testers.\nOnly once Particl gets “adoption-ready” will it start seeing any significant\nincrease in the levels of adoption.\n\nBut the same key question remains — how do we make that marketplace\nadoption-ready? The answer is more obvious than it may seem — you just gotta fix\nwhat makes people NOT want to use it, and then, once that’s done, you can start\nreaching out to people and actually expect a decent “lead conversion rate”, aka\nthe number of people you reach out to that convert into marketplace users.\n\nWhat are the Marketplace’s Current Pain Points?\nThe first step to increase the marketplace’s adoption is to first understand\nwhat’s preventing it from getting said adoption. What could be better? What’s\nmissing? To that end, the Particl team has recently received a feedback report\nfrom a very prominent crypto company\n[https://particl.news/bounding-forward-quality-feedback-from-a-private-peer-review-51e2e9c72fb7] \nwhich ended up being directly in line with what had been observed by the Particl\nteam itself.\n\nAs it currently stands, the reasons can mostly be separated into 4 different\ncategories:\n\n * Missing features\n\nBecause Particl is not a final product yet and still in Beta, it is in no way \nfeature complete [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_complete]. That means a\nlot of features simply aren’t ready or even started yet. These features could be\ntools that make sellers’ life easier, indicators that help buyers make\nbetter-informed purchasing decisions, etc.\n\nAnd while the release of Market Management will mark the end of an important\ndevelopment phase for the marketplace, one that was mostly focused on developing\nthe base layer of what the marketplace was always intended to be when Particl\nwas first launched, the next phase that will then begin will also have its load\nof very important features, although they might not impact the overall structure\nof the marketplace the same way Market Management will.\n\nAnd even then, once Market Management and other features will release, they\nprobably will have to be improved further moving ahead in time. Which brings us\nto the second category…\n\n * Required improvements on some features/functions\n\nReleasing a feature is something. Making sure it’s as efficient and smooth as it\nneeds to be is another. That much is made pretty evident with the major\nrefactoring of the marketplace that is currently underway and will hit mainnet\non the same release as the Market Management. Indeed, it is expected to\nsignificantly improve the marketplace’s performance, make it much lighter, and\nwill also noticeably change the look and feel of it. Not surprising when you\nlearn the update introducing Market Management touches around 80% or more of\nParticl’s marketplace components…\n\nAs time goes by, developers figure out more efficient ways to implement features\nand functions. The process of making those changes, after a feature is released,\nis called “refactoring [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring]”. Code\nrefactoring is also important when introducing new, major features that touch\ncomponents also touched by other previously released features. That’s to make\nsure the code’s health remains good and that the network doesn’t end up being a\nbig pile of spaghetti code [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code].\n\nBut more specifically in the context of user adoption, features that are already\nout or about to be released may need improvements moving forward before they\nbecome user-friendly. Additionally, features may be released in many different\nphases, first bringing the base layer for it, and then improving on it by adding\nmore functionalities and efficiency in following updates.\n\n * Required improvements on the marketplace’s performance and stability\n\nSometimes, the required improvements can be harder to pinpoint because they are\nnot directly related to specific features or functions. That’s because it may be\nthe whole back-end that requires some refactoring and improvements. While these\nchanges are more difficult to track and, at times, to even feel their impact, it\ndefinitely shows over multiple releases, each containing its own set of general\nimprovements.\n\nThose improvements are what make the marketplace generally faster. They are what\nmakes listings sync up more quickly, what makes listing fees smaller, what makes\nloading times shorter, etc.\n\nIt’s easy to overlook this particular category. After all, it’s a normal reflex\nto be thinking that once all the key features are in place, the product is ready\nto market. But there is much more than that, and each feature needs to be\nappropriately integrated and feel right before it can be considered as ready.\n\nConsidering that today’s traditional online marketplaces are built on the web,\nand also because most people access those with pretty decent internet\nconnections, speed and “hassle-free” user experience is expected from both\nsellers and buyers now more than ever. Even more so, users will generally be\nwilling to spend a little more if it means simpler and more pleasant user\nexperience. Which leads us to the fourth and final category…\n\n * Required improvements to the user interface (UI) and experience (UX)\n\n“UI/UX is everything”, or so… Referring to the previous statement, “users will\ngenerally be willing to spend a little more if it means a simpler and more\npleasant user experience”.\n\nOf course, UI/UX is not the only thing that matters, but it is what glues\neverything together so that it makes sense and just feels right. You can have\nall the features in the world, but if they are displayed confusingly or\nunpleasantly, people will generally not even bother. That becomes even truer as\na product’s learning curve gets steeper.\n\nThe reason behind this is mostly due to time constraints and the over-saturation\nof options available to users. Especially in the case of marketplaces — there\nare hundreds, if not thousands of them. Even if a marketplace’s value\nproposition is significant, it’s pretty hard to change people’s habits and get\nthem to move from a marketplace they know and feel comfortable using to one that\nis complicated to understand and doesn’t look as good (it’s pretty fair to\nsay…looks do matter).\n\nSo, is Particl’s Open Marketplace complicated to use? The answer might be “no”\nto you, but be assured it’s probably a resounding “YES” for most people you\nknow. So how do you make these people leap forward and into this new age for\nonline marketplaces? You gotta make sure that each of these 4 categories is\nbeing taken care of by the development team and bring the marketplace to a point\nthat it may finally be considered “adoption-ready”.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2020, Let’s Tackle Those Issues!\nNow that we know where lies the adoption hurdles for Particl’s Open Marketplace,\nit’s now time to strategize and plan around those. As such, the Particl team has\ncrafted a brand new development roadmap for 2020 and beyond. With adoption in\nmind, each of the roadmap items has been carefully selected to eliminate what\nwould make people not want to use the marketplace. There is one specific reason\nbehind each of these items.\n\nIt’s important to understand, though, that the 4 categories mentioned above are\ntightly intertwined. For example, you can’t spend too much time on UI/UX when\nthe marketplace may still significantly change structure as it will with the\nintegration of Market Management. But you should still do a little, as long as\nyou keep development hours wastes at a minimum. This is why Particl’s\ndevelopment team is focusing on these 4 categories as the underlying line of\nthinking behind the new roadmap’s content.\n\nThe Time to Reveal the New Roadmap is NOW ?\nYes indeed, the time to reveal the new roadmap has arrived! We now know just \nhow\nmuch has been done in 2019\n[https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819], how far has\nthe marketplace has progressed since releasing on mainnet\n[https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02],\nand what are the reasons it’s not been getting more adoption up until now. We\nare now equipped with all the tools to fully understand the reasoning behind the\nitems included in the new roadmap.\n\nWith that being said, you can safely expect the new roadmap to be revealed next\nweek, with its full and detailed breakdown being published on Particl.news\n[http://Particl.news].\n\nAs Market Management comes out in the next few weeks and with the new roadmap\ngiving a clear indication of the way forward for the project, the entire Particl\nteam is more than excited for what lies ahead of us all.

Now let’s get to it!</p><hr><h2 id=\"what-s-the-marketplace-s-current-stage-of-development\">What’s the Marketplace’s Current Stage of Development?</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/The-Way-Forward/1-1pWgQdPqD1Tgk3FBk2oKQw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Warning Banner Header on Particl Desktop</figcaption></figure><p>Before getting into the finer details, we first need to understand a very important fact — Particl’s Open Marketplace is still in its Beta phase, meaning it is still early software that’s in its testing/development phase. It is not a final product, far from that, and that’s true even though it is currently running on mainnet.</p><p>While Particl Desktop is certainly one of the most appealing crypto wallets out there, and while the Open Marketplace itself is pretty impressive for a live blockchain product, it is still missing key features intended for its final version. It is also relatively complex to use for most people (in this case, think in terms of “non-crypto users”), both of which make adoption a real challenge.</p><p>That, alone, explains the marketplace’s relatively low level of adoption compared to traditional online marketplaces. Particl’s current users can still definitely be considered as pioneers, and perhaps still at this point, testers. Only once Particl gets “adoption-ready” will it start seeing any significant increase in the levels of adoption.</p><p>But the same key question remains — how do we make that marketplace adoption-ready? The answer is more obvious than it may seem — you just gotta fix what makes people NOT want to use it, and then, once that’s done, you can start reaching out to people and actually expect a decent “lead conversion rate”, aka the number of people you reach out to that convert into marketplace users.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-marketplace-s-current-pain-points\">What are the Marketplace’s Current Pain Points?</h2><p>The first step to increase the marketplace’s adoption is to first understand what’s preventing it from getting said adoption. What could be better? What’s missing? To that end, <a href=\"https://particl.news/bounding-forward-quality-feedback-from-a-private-peer-review-51e2e9c72fb7\"><strong>the Particl team has recently received a feedback report from a very prominent crypto company</strong></a> which ended up being directly in line with what had been observed by the Particl team itself.</p><p>As it currently stands, the reasons can mostly be separated into 4 different categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Missing features</strong></li></ul><p>Because Particl is not a final product yet and still in Beta, it is in no way <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_complete\"><strong>feature complete</strong></a>. That means a lot of features simply aren’t ready or even started yet. These features could be tools that make sellers’ life easier, indicators that help buyers make better-informed purchasing decisions, etc.</p><p>And while the release of Market Management will mark the end of an important development phase for the marketplace, one that was mostly focused on developing the base layer of what the marketplace was always intended to be when Particl was first launched, the next phase that will then begin will also have its load of very important features, although they might not impact the overall structure of the marketplace the same way Market Management will.</p><p>And even then, once Market Management and other features will release, they probably will have to be improved further moving ahead in time. Which brings us to the second category…</p><ul><li><strong>Required improvements on some features/functions</strong></li></ul><p>Releasing a feature is something. Making sure it’s as efficient and smooth as it needs to be is another. That much is made pretty evident with the major refactoring of the marketplace that is currently underway and will hit mainnet on the same release as the Market Management. Indeed, it is expected to significantly improve the marketplace’s performance, make it much lighter, and will also noticeably change the look and feel of it. Not surprising when you learn the update introducing Market Management touches around 80% or more of Particl’s marketplace components…</p><p>As time goes by, developers figure out more efficient ways to implement features and functions. The process of making those changes, after a feature is released, is called “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring\"><strong>refactoring</strong></a>”. Code refactoring is also important when introducing new, major features that touch components also touched by other previously released features. That’s to make sure the code’s health remains good and that the network doesn’t end up being a big pile of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code\"><strong>spaghetti code</strong></a>.</p><p>But more specifically in the context of user adoption, features that are already out or about to be released may need improvements moving forward before they become user-friendly. Additionally, features may be released in many different phases, first bringing the base layer for it, and then improving on it by adding more functionalities and efficiency in following updates.</p><ul><li><strong>Required improvements on the marketplace’s performance and stability</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, the required improvements can be harder to pinpoint because they are not directly related to specific features or functions. That’s because it may be the whole back-end that requires some refactoring and improvements. While these changes are more difficult to track and, at times, to even feel their impact, it definitely shows over multiple releases, each containing its own set of general improvements.</p><p>Those improvements are what make the marketplace generally faster. They are what makes listings sync up more quickly, what makes listing fees smaller, what makes loading times shorter, etc.</p><p>It’s easy to overlook this particular category. After all, it’s a normal reflex to be thinking that once all the key features are in place, the product is ready to market. But there is much more than that, and each feature needs to be appropriately integrated and <em>feel right</em> before it can be considered as ready.</p><p>Considering that today’s traditional online marketplaces are built on the web, and also because most people access those with pretty decent internet connections, speed and “hassle-free” user experience is expected from both sellers and buyers now more than ever. Even more so, users will generally be willing to spend a little more if it means simpler and more pleasant user experience. Which leads us to the fourth and final category…</p><ul><li><strong>Required improvements to the user interface (UI) and experience (UX)</strong></li></ul><p>“UI/UX is everything”, or so… Referring to the previous statement, “users will generally be willing to spend a little more if it means a simpler and more pleasant user experience”.</p><p>Of course, UI/UX is not the only thing that matters, but it is what glues everything together so that it makes sense and just feels right. You can have all the features in the world, but if they are displayed confusingly or unpleasantly, people will generally not even bother. That becomes even truer as a product’s learning curve gets steeper.</p><p>The reason behind this is mostly due to time constraints and the over-saturation of options available to users. Especially in the case of marketplaces — there are hundreds, if not thousands of them. Even if a marketplace’s value proposition is significant, it’s pretty hard to change people’s habits and get them to move from a marketplace they know and feel comfortable using to one that is complicated to understand and doesn’t look as good (it’s pretty fair to say…looks do matter).</p><p>So, is Particl’s Open Marketplace complicated to use? The answer might be “no” to you, but be assured it’s probably a resounding “YES” for most people you know. So how do you make these people leap forward and into this new age for online marketplaces? You gotta make sure that each of these 4 categories is being taken care of by the development team and bring the marketplace to a point that it may finally be considered “adoption-ready”.</p><hr><h2 id=\"in-2020-let-s-tackle-those-issues-\">In 2020, Let’s Tackle Those Issues!</h2><p>Now that we know where lies the adoption hurdles for Particl’s Open Marketplace, it’s now time to strategize and plan around those.

For example, you can’t spend too much time on UI/UX when the marketplace may still significantly change structure as it will with the integration of Market Management.

There are many challenging yet\nachievable goals proposed by this company that validate the contributions\neveryone has made to Particl so far. They also give positive reinforcement to\nour short and long-term direction of building better tech and attracting more\ndaily users; aka adoption.\n\nThe “who” isn’t as important as is the fact that this is more an intriguing\nsampling of many peer reviews our products are receiving from potential\npartners, investors, services looking to join us on this ride. However — of\ncourse — it does matter “who” is really, truly looking at what is going on in\nthe De-Commerce (has a nice ring to it ?) space so I can divulge that it’s a\nlarge crypto company that touches nearly all the top projects and products in\nour space. This is a group we first reached out to about integrations for\nbroader adoption and the relationship has been nurtured for over a\nyear-and-a-half.\n\nSo what do they have to say? My first thought when I read their feedback and\nrecommendations was, “We need to share this with the community!” I’ve said it\nmany times, in the early stages our voice needs to get louder and louder for\nreal adoption to happen. That means all of us.\n\nIt got me excited about 2020 and beyond — I hope it does you as well.\n> “We can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we\ncreated them.” – Albert Einstein, Thinker\nI’ll start at the bottom and work up. First, we have things they identified as\nunsatisfactory or in need of improvements.\n\nAs a trained architect, critique like this is like gold. It’s enlightening to\nread through honest observations, and when we’re enlightened we change.\n\nReducing barriers for adoption\nPrivacy-focused products are niche, underground and nerdy. That’s cool, but\ncan’t be “good enough” and can’t be a crutch to expanding outside of the crypto\necosystem. To this end, Particl is falling into the same trap as Tor, Tails and\neven DuckDuckGo — building better alternatives that add more steps to ensure\nprivacy.\n\n * What are ways we are reducing barriers to see significant marketplace\n   adoption of the Particl Open Marketplace?\n * Is our product available where the target users will find it?\n * Mobile app vs downloadable client\n\nLow transactions using privacy features\nParticl base transactions are private by user choice. Open Marketplace\ntransactions are private by default. Privacy for senders and receivers only\nimproves as the anonymity set increases on chain. Marketplace transactions\nutilize the full suite of privacy features on Particl.\n\n * What are measurable methods to increasing the amount of transactions using\n   privacy features?\n * Are there incentives that can be built in to increase transactions using\n   privacy features?\n * Can services and exchanges be receptive to enabling private transactions with\n   PART?\n\nQuality and depth of product inventory\nCurrently we have around 500 items listed daily on the Open Marketplace. There\nis a lot of variety from games to electronics to health products. However, I\nthink this is one of the most insightful points within the review. Quantity vs\nquality can be the difference between 1,000 daily users and 10,000 daily users.\n\n * What tools to vendors need to move their inventories onto Particl Open\n   Marketplace?\n * Customers use their phone to shop while Particl only offers a downloadable\n   client, when and how does a mobile version of Open Marketplace improve the\n   quality of products available?\n * Who is the target audience?\n\nNext are three areas we actually are focused on at the moment and internally see\nas crucial to improve on. There is no question the Open Marketplace is an\nattractive product — especially compared to traditionally clunky privacy-focused\napplications and cryptocurrency clients. What can we improve upon to\nmetaphorically put some meat on the strong bones in place to take things to the\nnext level?\n\nMore awareness of the growth on the marketplace\nOur Open Marketplace has been live on the main chain for close to 6 months and\nthe small amount of measurable metrics track-able show that it has been\nrelatively successful and is growing. Being private-by-default doesn’t give\ncompanies reviewing our products much to work with to show either profitability\nor growth. It is really just 2 things, volume and transactions. A third metric\nwe can track is MAD contracts. Not the content but just the amount of them that\nget completed. Keeping things private, but finding better ways to bring\nawareness to the popularity of the Open Marketplace will take an army —who’s in?\n\n * Will private markets and private sales featured in the upcoming Market\n   Management module improve secondary/private marketplace awareness?\n * Does pegging prices to a volatile coin like PART hurt growth possibilities\n   versus introducing a stable coin/fiat pairing?\n * How do vendors promote their products?\n\nAdditional dapps featuring PART\nI think growing our development community outside the primary team is a big\nhurdle we haven’t figured out yet. All our repos are open source and there for\nimprovements by anyone at anytime.\n\n * What type of incentive structure can be established to spur on new developers\n   joining the mission of Particl?\n * Can community funding (kickstarter-like) campaigns usher in more ideas,\n   initiatives, opportunities that the team frankly hasn’t even considered or\n   thought of yet?\n * What is the timeline on a simple SDK toolset with documentation so\n   development teams looking for a solution like Particl has already built can\n   jump-start their big business idea?\n\nIncreasing the anonymity set\nPrivacy projects are always fighting among themselves as to who is the best (of\ncourse except us — of course ?). There’s pros and cons on each out there. The\nreal winners are projects that actually code, the real losers are projects that\njust copy other work and turn around an claim to be somehow better.

As we are jumping into\nthis new decade with both feet\n[https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819], it’s time to\nget serious about the adoption of the marketplace. As such, the Particl team has\ncrafted a new and pretty extensive development roadmap that specifically focuses\non bringing what needs to be brought for Particl’s marketplace to be considered\n“adoption-ready”.\n\nBut before getting into it, let’s make sure we understand where the Particl\nmarketplace currently stands — what are its strengths and unique offerings, how\nfar has it come since being released, and what prevents it from getting adopted\nby more users. Once that is understood, it then becomes easier to wrap our heads\naround what needs to be done moving forward to make sure the marketplace gets\nthe success it quite frankly deserves.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat Makes Particl’s Marketplace Unique?\nParticl’s Open Marketplace is most definitely a unique offering in the eCommerce\nindustry, even still to this day. It allows online sellers and buyers to connect\ndirectly with each other, without requiring any sort of middleman assistance\n(i.e. a company operating an online marketplace), and conduct business without\nthe usual costs associated with selling and buying online such as transaction\nfees, sales commissions, marketplace subscriptions, currency conversions, and\netc.\n\nAdditionally, the marketplace is also built using various security and\nprivacy-enhancing technologies so that no data (i.e. sales data) or personal\ninformation can be collected by any outside party, a particularly important perk\nin an age where data mining, monetization, breaches, and leaks have become far\ntoo common. Equally as important, better privacy within the eCommerce industry\nundoubtedly leads to better business and competitive practices as well as a more\nfair environment for sellers.\n\nOn top of that combination of near-zero cost and superior data security, the\nmarketplace requires no sign-up, no login, no personal or business information,\nis censorship-proof, free to use, and works from any country in the world, as\nlong as you can connect to the internet.\n\nQuite simply, there is not a single marketplace on the web offering such an\nambitious and novel combination of features. The reason for it is also quite\nsimple to understand — getting this full set of features packaged into a\nmarketplace requires the use of various novel distributed and privacy-preserving\nprotocols that have only recently been made available to developers across the\nworld.\n\nA Novel, Never-Been-Done-Before Concept\nAs a very obvious example of this, let’s take just one component that makes up\nParticl’s marketplace — its automated double deposit escrow system. Particl’s\nescrow system works on smart-contract functionalities and requires a combination\nof RingCT and CT cryptocurrency transactions so that any transaction information\nbetween a buyer and seller remains only known to these two transacting parties.\nIn other words, it makes escrow transactions completely untraceable and\nunlinkable to any party not associated with a particular marketplace\ntransaction.\n\nAnd while RingCT has been available, on Monero, for a few years now, it never\nwas built in a way that it could be used in smart-contracts. Additionally, most\nof the other currently available privacy protocols simply weren’t programmable\n(can’t be used in smart-contracts) or simply weren’t realistically scalable\nenough to make sense to use as part of a marketplace product. For this reason,\nthe Particl team had to build its own custom implementation of RingCT (and\nbulletproofs) so that it could be used by decentralized applications on the\nParticl network, and that’s only been available for a few months.\n\nThis is just one isolated example of technology that became available just\nrecently. Particl’s entire platform is composed of such novel components, and so\nit’s no wonder that there is still no marketplace in existence currently\noffering the same combination of perks as Particl does.\n\nPioneering Takes Time, Efforts, and a Solid Vision\nBut being at the edge of technology also has its drawbacks. After all, Particl’s\nmarketplace is still early Beta software and isn’t really the simplest\nmarketplace to use out there. It really works, but it simply can’t realistically\nbe expected to be adopted by any sort of “mainstream” type of user.\n\nIt does provide many benefits that are very real, but the technical knowledge\nand the learning curve required to even use it is still relatively steep. That’s\none of the biggest obstacles currently standing in Particl’s way when it comes\nto the adoption of the marketplace.\n\nBut rest assured, that is perfectly normal for any new technology that’s as\ngroundbreaking as Particl’s marketplace and uses technologies that have only\nbeen made available for a short time. It takes time to disrupt an industry\nthat’s as competitive as the eCommerce sector, and it also takes time for brand\nnew types of technologies to mature up to the point where most people feel\ncomfortable using it. Remember the advent of the internet in the early '90s?\n\nThe Particl team is indeed well aware of the marketplace’s current lack of\n“mainstream” appeal. Most of the features, functions, and general user\nexperience that would actually be expected from your typical marketplace user\n(think your parents, significant other, or friends that aren’t as “crypto crazy”\nas we all are) are still being built, and they’ve been nicely incorporated into\nthe new Particl 2020 development roadmap.\n\nSome of the additions required to make the marketplace more\n“mainstream-appealing” have already been deployed since first releasing the\nmarketplace on mainnet and can be used by anyone at this very moment. They are\neither features, improvements, or important functions that help make a buyer or\nseller’s life easier. Let’s review what these improvements and additions are and\nsee how has Particl’s marketplace evolved over the last few months.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow Has the Marketplace Evolved Since Launch?\nNot only has the marketplace consistently been pushing its all-time high number\nof listings higher and higher [https://www.demarkets.io/stats], but the number\nof mainnet transactions on the Particl network has also seen a\ndramatic rise [https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/#!overview], now averaging more\nthan 200 transactions per day. These transactions include listed items, escrow\ntransactions, the flagging of items, created and votes on community proposals,\nbalance transfers, and regular currency transactions.\n\nAdditionally, and perhaps even more importantly, the Particl network has been\ngetting much more private! Indeed, the network’s “anon set”, the number of\nRingCT outputs available to anonymize transactions, has been growing\nexponentially since the launch of the Open Marketplace, averaging a steady 30%\nor more increase per month. The anon set currently stands at 5232, a whopping\n149% increase since August 2019. To observe that value goes up and down by\nyourself, just open up your Particl Desktop wallet and type anonoutput in the\nconsole window. As the Open Marketplace and the Particl network gets more\nadoption, you can expect that number to keep rising, meaning RingCT transactions\nwill keep on getting more private.\n\nMore Tools and Features Made Available\nParticl’s Open Marketplace is still Beta software, meaning it is still very much\na work-in-progress and under heavy development. As such, it is normal that some\nof the intended features for its first “final” version are still missing to this\nday. The good thing, though, is that these features and improvements are coming\nup quite quickly!\n\nEver since the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace on the 12th of August,\n2019, we’ve seen these improvements go live…\n\n * Import products (bulk listing)\n\nThis feature allows sellers to import products from outside sources such as .csv\nfiles and WooCommerce stores. It is particularly useful to manage large\ninventories and list items in bulk. This feature is ultimately designed to reach\nits full potential when used in combination with the upcoming Market Management\n[https://particl.news/market-management-is-next-3e35356d5de0] and Inventory\nManagement tools.\n\n * Public comments (Q&A)\n\nThis feature allows anyone to leave a comment, review, feedback, or question on\nany listing posted on the Open Marketplace. Leaving a post notifies the seller\nof the item which can then respond. Posts made by the seller of an item are\nclearly identified as such. This feature is intended to better help you make\nbetter shopping decisions and know more about the items you’re looking to buy. \nPublic comments will tie in nicely with future reputation models intended to be\nimplemented at a later stage during the Beta stage of development.\n\n * Cancel bids\n\nIt used to be impossible to cancel an order before the seller accepted it,\nmeaning funds could get stuck in limbo when sellers were inactive and not\nprocessing orders. While it was possible to manually unlock these coins, it did\nrequire a fair bit of technical knowledge about the Particl platform itself. Far\nfrom ideal! This is why an update was made to the marketplace to add this\nimportant functionality.\n\n * Settings page\n\nThe first iteration of the Settings page has been added a few weeks after the\nlaunch of the Open Marketplace Beta. While it currently only contains basic\nsettings such as notification management and wallet backup options, the Settings\npage will play a bigger role once Market Management and other future major\nfeatures are integrated.\n\n * In-wallet Bitcoin exchange\n\nThis major and exciting update to Particl Desktop added the ability to swap\nBitcoin for Particl right inside the wallet. This means anyone can now “top up”\ntheir Open Marketplace account using Bitcoin. No need to register on an exchange\nor give away your personal information (i.e. KYC, IP address, etc), and it works\neverywhere, even in the US!\n\nThis exchange module is currently powered by the SMSG network and connects\ndirectly to the SimpleSwap [http://simpleswap.io] exchange, but is built in such\na way that it can integrate almost any exchange or service provider as long as\nthe required APIs are provided by the third-party. This update was very\nimportant as it opens the door for Particl to be adopted outside of its own\ncommunity by accepting a varied list of currencies.\n\n * Bot Management\n\nThe Bot Management feature was introduced at the same time as the Bitcoin\nExchange module was. It is, in fact, what powers it. The Bot Management feature\nallows you to use and list SMSG bots that provide added third-party services to\nParticl Desktop. These added services can be bridges to crypto exchanges or fiat\npayment gateways, as well as many other sorts of services.\n\nHowever, because this is the first iteration of the feature, it is currently not\npossible to manually add your bot to the list of available bots. That’s because\nsecurity measures still need to be put in place to make sure people do not push\nmalicious bots on the network. The Bot Management tool is planned to be an\nintegral part of the upcoming developer SDK.\n\n * SMSG improvements\n\nSMSG is the P2P network that powers the Open Marketplace. It securely and\nprivately hosts data (i.e. listing images and descriptions) and makes several\nprocesses possible such as displaying listings, flagging items, exchanging\nBitcoin for Particl, and etc. It is the backbone of the entire Particl\necosystem.\n\nSince the marketplace’s mainnet launch, the SMSG network has seen its\nperformance vastly improved, notably with how effectively it displays listings\nand communicates between peers. Improving SMSG will be an ongoing process as we\nmove forward through the Beta phase of development.\n\n * Significantly reduced listing fees\n\nOne of the big updates that were made to the SMSG network is the ability for\nstakers to signal lower listing fees to the network. What that means is that\nanyone staking on the Particl network can have a say on how much the network\ncharges users for publishing listings on the Open Marketplace.\n\nAs a result, ever since the launch of the Beta, listing fees have been reduced\nby a big fat 53%! This is already great, making it much cheaper for sellers to\nlist items, but fees are also expected to go down even more, by at least 80%, in\nthe next SMSG update. That’s what near-zero cost eCommerce means!\n\n * Various improvements, tweaks, and fixes based on user suggestions\n\nOn top of everything mentioned above, a LOT of tweaks, fixes, and improvements\nhave been made to both the code and the user experience of Particl Desktop and\nthe Open Marketplace. A lot of these changes have been made based on user\nfeedback, and it is the one reason why the “Report bug” button has been added at\nthe bottom left of the Particl Desktop client. All user feedback is very\nimportant and really makes it easier for Particl developers to see what areas\nneed to be improved or tweaked. The more feedback is received, the faster issues\ncan be addressed. For this reason, it is highly recommended to be pro-active in\nreporting issues and making suggestions on Github.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith all of the above in mind, it is clear that Particl’s marketplace is getting\nbetter and easier to use by the day. Of course, there is still some stuff\nmissing or that could be improved, but that’s more than normal given the Beta\nnature of the product.\n\nSo what’s left to do? What is the marketplace missing? What could be improved to\nbe able to attract a wider range of users and make sure they remain users over a\nlonger period of time?\n\nThat’s what we’ll be exploring later this week in a future article published\nhere at Particl.news [http://Particl.news]. These are all questions that the\nteam has asked itself recently, along with a few community contributors, and\nwhich resulted in a brand new (and dare I say…exciting!) development roadmap. \nWatch out for next week, because that’s when the new development roadmap will be\npublicly revealed!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-Progress-So-Far/1-l9wIwdXxGp6dWHRnhXfqPQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"it-s-almost-time-for-particl-to-shine-\">It’s almost time for Particl to shine! ?</h3><p>The Beta version of Particl’s Open Marketplace has been out for a few months now, and it’s been evolving pretty nicely ever since.

As such, the Particl team has crafted a new and pretty extensive development roadmap that specifically focuses on bringing what needs to be brought for Particl’s marketplace to be considered “adoption-ready”.</p><p>But before getting into it, let’s make sure we understand where the Particl marketplace currently stands — what are its strengths and unique offerings, how far has it come since being released, and what prevents it from getting adopted by more users. Once that is understood, it then becomes easier to wrap our heads around what needs to be done moving forward to make sure the marketplace gets the success it quite frankly deserves.</p><hr><h2 id=\"what-makes-particl-s-marketplace-unique\">What Makes Particl’s Marketplace Unique?</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-Progress-So-Far/1-X5zYJtOFQWkVjnOD6Zr_nA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Particl’s Open Marketplace is most definitely a unique offering in the eCommerce industry, even still to this day. It allows online sellers and buyers to connect directly with each other, without requiring any sort of middleman assistance (i.e. a company operating an online marketplace), and conduct business without the usual costs associated with selling and buying online such as transaction fees, sales commissions, marketplace subscriptions, currency conversions, and etc.</p><p>Additionally, the marketplace is also built using various security and privacy-enhancing technologies so that no data (i.e. sales data) or personal information can be collected by any outside party, a particularly important perk in an age where data mining, monetization, breaches, and leaks have become far too common. Equally as important, better privacy within the eCommerce industry undoubtedly leads to better business and competitive practices as well as a more fair environment for sellers.</p><p>On top of that combination of near-zero cost and superior data security, the marketplace requires no sign-up, no login, no personal or business information, is censorship-proof, free to use, and works from any country in the world, as long as you can connect to the internet.</p><p>Quite simply, there is not a single marketplace on the web offering such an ambitious and novel combination of features. The reason for it is also quite simple to understand — getting this full set of features packaged into a marketplace requires the use of various novel distributed and privacy-preserving protocols that have only recently been made available to developers across the world.</p><h3 id=\"a-novel-never-been-done-before-concept\">A Novel, Never-Been-Done-Before Concept</h3><p>As a very obvious example of this, let’s take just one component that makes up Particl’s marketplace — its automated double deposit escrow system. Particl’s escrow system works on smart-contract functionalities and <strong>requires a combination of RingCT and CT cryptocurrency transactions</strong> so that any transaction information between a buyer and seller remains only known to these two transacting parties. In other words, it makes escrow transactions completely untraceable and unlinkable to any party not associated with a particular marketplace transaction.</p><p>And while RingCT has been available, on Monero, for a few years now, it never was built in a way that it could be used in smart-contracts. Additionally, most of the other currently available privacy protocols simply weren’t programmable (can’t be used in smart-contracts) or simply weren’t realistically scalable enough to make sense to use as part of a marketplace product. For this reason, the Particl team had to build its own custom implementation of RingCT (and bulletproofs) so that it could be used by decentralized applications on the Particl network, and that’s only been available for a few months.</p><p>This is just one isolated example of technology that became available just recently. Particl’s entire platform is composed of such novel components, and so it’s no wonder that there is still no marketplace in existence currently offering the same combination of perks as Particl does.</p><h3 id=\"pioneering-takes-time-efforts-and-a-solid-vision\">Pioneering Takes Time, Efforts, and a Solid Vision</h3><p>But being at the edge of technology also has its drawbacks. After all, Particl’s marketplace is still early Beta software and isn’t really the simplest marketplace to use out there. It really works, but it simply can’t realistically be expected to be adopted by any sort of “mainstream” type of user.</p><p>It does provide many benefits that are very real, but the technical knowledge and the learning curve required to even use it is still relatively steep. That’s one of the biggest obstacles currently standing in Particl’s way when it comes to the adoption of the marketplace.</p><p>But rest assured, that is perfectly normal for any new technology that’s as groundbreaking as Particl’s marketplace and uses technologies that have only been made available for a short time. It takes time to disrupt an industry that’s as competitive as the eCommerce sector, and it also takes time for brand new types of technologies to mature up to the point where most people feel comfortable using it. Remember the advent of the internet in the early '90s?</p><p>The Particl team is indeed well aware of the marketplace’s current lack of “mainstream” appeal. Most of the features, functions, and general user experience that would actually be expected from your typical marketplace user (think your parents, significant other, or friends that aren’t as “crypto crazy” as we all are) are still being built, and they’ve been nicely incorporated into the new Particl 2020 development roadmap.</p><p>Some of the additions required to make the marketplace more “mainstream-appealing” have already been deployed since first releasing the marketplace on mainnet and can be used by anyone at this very moment. They are either features, improvements, or important functions that help make a buyer or seller’s life easier. Let’s review what these improvements and additions are and see how has Particl’s marketplace evolved over the last few months.</p><hr><h2 id=\"how-has-the-marketplace-evolved-since-launch\">How Has the Marketplace Evolved Since Launch?</h2><p>Not only has the marketplace <a href=\"https://www.demarkets.io/stats\">consistently been pushing its <strong>all-time high number of listings</strong> higher and higher</a>, but <a href=\"https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/#!overview\">the <strong>number of mainnet transactions on the Particl network has also seen a dramatic rise</strong></a>, now averaging more than 200 transactions per day. These transactions include listed items, escrow transactions, the flagging of items, created and votes on community proposals, balance transfers, and regular currency transactions.</p><p>Additionally, and perhaps even more importantly, <strong>the Particl network has been getting much more private</strong>! Indeed, the network’s “<strong>anon set</strong>”, the number of RingCT outputs available to anonymize transactions, has been growing exponentially since the launch of the Open Marketplace, averaging a <strong>steady 30% or more increase per month</strong>. The anon set currently stands at 5232, a whopping 149% increase since August 2019. To observe that value goes up and down by yourself, just open up your Particl Desktop wallet and type anonoutput in the console window. As the Open Marketplace and the Particl network gets more adoption, you can expect that number to keep rising, meaning RingCT transactions will keep on getting more private.</p><h2 id=\"more-tools-and-features-made-available\">More Tools and Features Made Available</h2><p>Particl’s Open Marketplace is still Beta software, meaning it is still very much a work-in-progress and under heavy development. As such, it is normal that some of the intended features for its first “final” version are still missing to this day. The good thing, though, is that these features and improvements are coming up quite quickly!</p><p>Ever since the mainnet release of the Open Marketplace on the 12th of August, 2019, we’ve seen these improvements go live…</p><ul><li><strong>Import products (bulk listing)</strong></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-Progress-So-Far/1-6OzrmrlZyD70STSd3qalJQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>This feature allows sellers to <strong>import products from outside sources</strong> such as .csv files and WooCommerce stores. It is particularly useful to <strong>manage large inventories</strong> and <strong>list items in bulk</strong>. This feature is ultimately designed to reach its full potential when used in combination with the upcoming <a href=\"https://particl.news/market-management-is-next-3e35356d5de0\"><strong>Market Management</strong></a> and <strong>Inventory Management</strong> tools.</p><ul><li><strong>Public comments (Q&amp;A)</strong></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-Progress-So-Far/1-B_MoI8All6pasNe7Bht7CA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>This feature allows anyone to <strong>leave a comment, review, feedback, or question on any listing</strong> posted on the Open Marketplace. Leaving a post notifies the seller of the item which can then respond. Posts made by the seller of an item are clearly identified as such. This feature is intended to better help you make better shopping decisions and know more about the items you’re looking to buy. <strong>Public comments will tie in nicely with future reputation models</strong> intended to be implemented at a later stage during the Beta stage of development.</p><ul><li><strong>Cancel bids</strong></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-Progress-So-Far/1-PPj8p8kjjfVsguxanMHIJA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>It used to be impossible to cancel an order before the seller accepted it, meaning funds could get stuck in limbo when sellers were inactive and not processing orders. While it was possible to manually unlock these coins, it did require a fair bit of technical knowledge about the Particl platform itself. Far from ideal! This is why an update was made to the marketplace to add this important functionality.</p><ul><li><strong>Settings page</strong></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-Progress-So-Far/1-V2s_ynpbpUpMDqb5VTfYkw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>The first iteration of the Settings page has been added a few weeks after the launch of the Open Marketplace Beta. While it currently only contains basic settings such as notification management and wallet backup options, the Settings page will play a bigger role once Market Management and other future major features are integrated.</p><ul><li><strong>In-wallet Bitcoin exchange</strong></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-Progress-So-Far/1-DUg2gAjvJRbh6T2T0c7n9Q.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>This major and exciting update to Particl Desktop added the ability to <strong>swap Bitcoin for Particl</strong> right inside the wallet. This means anyone can now “top up” their Open Marketplace account using Bitcoin. <strong>No need to register on an exchange or give away your personal information</strong> (i.e. KYC, IP address, etc), and it works everywhere, even in the US!</p><p>This exchange module is currently powered by the SMSG network and connects directly to the <a href=\"http://simpleswap.io\"><strong>SimpleSwap</strong></a> exchange, but is built in such a way that it can integrate almost any exchange or service provider as long as the required APIs are provided by the third-party. This update was very important as it opens the door for Particl to be adopted outside of its own community by accepting a varied list of currencies.</p><ul><li><strong>Bot Management</strong></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-Progress-So-Far/1-jw4vyiR1I99aRdq_J6zaiQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>The Bot Management feature was introduced at the same time as the Bitcoin Exchange module was. It is, in fact, what powers it. The Bot Management feature allows you to<strong> use and list SMSG bots that provide added third-party services</strong> to Particl Desktop. These added services can be <strong>bridges to crypto exchanges</strong> or <strong>fiat payment gateways</strong>, as well as many other sorts of services.</p><p>However, because this is the first iteration of the feature, it is currently not possible to manually add your bot to the list of available bots. That’s because security measures still need to be put in place to make sure people do not push malicious bots on the network. The Bot Management tool is planned to be an integral part of the upcoming developer SDK.</p><ul><li><strong>SMSG improvements</strong></li></ul><p>SMSG is the P2P network that powers the Open Marketplace. It securely and privately hosts data (i.e. listing images and descriptions) and makes several processes possible such as displaying listings, flagging items, exchanging Bitcoin for Particl, and etc. It is the backbone of the entire Particl ecosystem.</p><p>Since the marketplace’s mainnet launch, the SMSG network has seen its performance vastly improved, notably with how effectively it displays listings and communicates between peers. Improving SMSG will be an ongoing process as we move forward through the Beta phase of development.</p><ul><li><strong>Significantly reduced listing fees</strong></li></ul><p>One of the big updates that were made to the SMSG network is the ability for stakers to signal lower listing fees to the network. What that means is that anyone staking on the Particl network can have a say on how much the network charges users for publishing listings on the Open Marketplace.</p><p>As a result, ever since the launch of the Beta, <strong>listing fees have been reduced by a big fat 53%</strong>! This is already great, making it much cheaper for sellers to list items, but fees are also expected to<strong> go down even more, by at least 80%</strong>, in the next SMSG update. That’s what <strong>near-zero cost eCommerce</strong> means!</p><ul><li><strong>Various improvements, tweaks, and fixes based on user suggestions</strong></li></ul><p>On top of everything mentioned above, a LOT of tweaks, fixes, and improvements have been made to both the code and the user experience of Particl Desktop and the Open Marketplace. A lot of these changes have been made based on user feedback, and it is the one reason why the “Report bug” button has been added at the bottom left of the Particl Desktop client. All user feedback is very important and really makes it easier for Particl developers to see what areas need to be improved or tweaked. The more feedback is received, the faster issues can be addressed. For this reason, it is highly recommended to be pro-active in reporting issues and making suggestions on Github.</p><hr><p>With all of the above in mind, it is clear that Particl’s marketplace is getting better and easier to use by the day. Of course, there is still some stuff missing or that could be improved, but that’s more than normal given the Beta nature of the product.</p><p>So what’s left to do? What is the marketplace missing? What could be improved to be able to attract a wider range of users and make sure they remain users over a longer period of time?</p><p><strong>That’s what we’ll be exploring later this week in a future article published here at </strong><a href=\"http://Particl.news\"><strong>Particl.news</strong></a><strong>.</strong> These are all questions that the team has asked itself recently, along with a few community contributors, and which resulted in a brand new (and dare I say…exciting!) development roadmap. <strong>Watch out for next week, because that’s when the new development roadmap will be publicly revealed!</strong></p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-Progress-So-Far/1-mclmOaKPQAUhM0MVkWrK0A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure>","url":"http://localhost:2368/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"27e7f6c7-ee55-41af-822f-ac7f255949ff","codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5f7e4ca61a93b603e3f7679e","reading_time":10,"send_email_when_published":false,"email_subject":null,"childHtmlRehype":{"html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Open-Marketplace-Progress-So-Far/1-l9wIwdXxGp6dWHRnhXfqPQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><h3 id=\"it-s-almost-time-for-particl-to-shine-\">It’s almost time for Particl to shine! ?</h3><p>The Beta version of Particl’s Open Marketplace has been out for a few months now, and it’s been evolving pretty nicely ever since.

As they say, the cat is out of the bag\nand there ain’t no stopping it!\n\nShortly before that moment, world-renowned security firm Quarkslab\n[https://www.quarkslab.com/en/] released the results of their audit of Particl’s\ncustom-built RingCT (MLSAG, more specifically) and Bulletproofs protocols.

Because of that, Particl was able to\ndeliver on its two biggest promised deliverables for mainnet —the Open\nMarketplace and RingCT (untraceable transactions).\n\nParticl’s Open Marketplace live on mainnet!Yes, 2019 was a development heavy\nyear. That is thanks to a passionate team of developers and contributors who\nsimply won’t give up on the idea of private, free, and borderless eCommerce.\nThey breathe and bleed Particl, and each day they help make that vision a\nreality and make it more and more accessible to everybody.\n\nTogether, let’s go through the 2019 development timeline.

Keep in mind it doesn’t even include Particl\nCore releases! ?\n\nIndeed, one particularly impressive aspect of Particl’s development is how it\nalways keeps its codebase up-to-date with the latest Bitcoin codebase version.\nThat’s to ensure Particl’s base layer benefits from all the latest Bitcoin\nimprovements so that it can remain secure and can easily integrate any\ninnovation happening in Bitcoin’s world. Put simply, an up-to-date codebase\nmeans security, reliability, performance, and compatibility.\n\nAnd while “keeping the codebase up-to-date” may initially sound like a simple\nand almost robotic task, there’s definitely a reason barely any Bitcoin-based\n“altcoin”, if any, properly keeps its codebase up-to-date — it’s a tedious and\nquite complicated task. That’s because the upstream Bitcoin code needs to be\nmade to fit and be compatible with any added component to Particl’s codebase. It\ncouldn’t further from a simple “copy-paste process”…\n\nThis year, this translated into 19 individual core releases, a true testament to\nthe constant hard work put in by Particl’s Core Developer & Cryptographic\nResearcher Tecnovert [https://github.com/tecnovert].\n\nParticl Core Releases (19 total)\n * Jan. 1, 2019 —Particl Core 0.17.1.0\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.0]\n * Feb. 6, 2019 —Particl Core 0.17.1.2\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.2]\n * Feb. 14, 2019 —Particl Core 0.17.1.3\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.3]\n * Mar. 7, 2019 —Particl Core 0.17.1.4\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.4]\n * May 9, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.0.7\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.7]\n * Jun. 4, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.0.8\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.8]\n * Jun. 24, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.0.10\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.10]\n * Jul. 2, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.0.11\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.11]\n * Jul. 18, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.0.12\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.12]\n * Aug. 4, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.0\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.0]\n * Aug. 8, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.1\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.1]\n * Aug. 12, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.2\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.2]\n * Aug. 22, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.3\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.3]\n * Sep. 3, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.4\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.4]\n * Sep. 26, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.5\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.5]\n * Oct. 29, 2019 —Particl Core 0.19.0.1 RC2 (Pre-Release)\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1rc2]\n * Oct. 31, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.6\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.6]\n * Dec. 4, 2019 —Particl Core 0.18.1.7 (Pre-Release)\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.7]\n * Dec. 3, 2019 —Particl Core 0.19.0.1 (Pre-Release)\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Around the World\nAnother great move by Particl in 2019 was to increase its boots-on-the-ground\npresence by attending, sponsoring, and presenting at several blockchain\nconferences, events, and meetups all around the world.\n\nSome of Particl’s team after SFBW’s Epicenter conferenceBlockchain events are\nideal networking opportunities for teams to find each other, build\nrelationships, and start collaborating on multiple fronts. In that sense, they\nare the perfect “matchmakers”.\n\nAs such, the Particl team has made a lot of key connections with individuals and\nteams that will help the project make the jump from an almost exclusively\ndevelopment focused project to one putting much more focus into the user\nadoption of its platform.\n\nIt’s very important to understand one thing, though, is that these relationships\nbuilt at blockchain events can take some time until they start yielding visible\nresults. Most of the time, it takes many dozens of work hours and conference\ncalls before things fall into place and start moving ahead. The best example of\nthis concept is with the addition of Spend.com [https://spend.com]’s President,\nBryan Woods, as new eCommerce strategic advisor for Particl.\n\nParticl Welcomes Spend.com President as New Advisor\n[https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-spend-com-president-as-new-advisor-7afcce8c7d71]\nBryan Woods — eCommerce Strategy and Adoption ?particl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-spend-com-president-as-new-advisor-7afcce8c7d71]\n\nThe Particl team met with Bryan at Consensus 2019, in May, and only started\ntalking about it more publicly when it was announced at SFBW’s Epicenter, in\nNovember, that he would be joining Particl’s advisory board. Still to this day,\nit is too early to reveal any of what’s being worked on with him even though\nit’s been in the works for quite some time now.\n\nDr. Kap Talking at SFBW’s EpicenterThe bottom line is that these blockchain\nevents are great to make valuable connections that, over time, will come back\nhelping the project tremendously. The team is currently in active talks with\nmany people and projects met at conferences and it should yield more visible\nresults later on in 2020.\n\nPut simply, some of the best decisions taken by the Particl team in 2019 was to\nattend Consensus and the San Francisco Blockchain Week (SFBW).\n\n2019 Conferences and Events\n * Feb. 4, 2019 —Particl in Paris — CoinHouse\n   [https://particl.news/particl-in-paris-presentations-at-coinhouse-a38106cdd36a] \n    ??\n * Mar. 13–14, 2019 —Particl in Hong Kong — Token2049\n   [https://particl.news/particl-is-going-to-hong-kongs-token-2049-conference-e1fca540740b] \n    ??\n * May 11–12, 2019 —Particl in NYC — Magical Crypto Conference\n   [https://particl.news/particl-in-nyc-magical-crypto-conference-2019-459c1f868522] \n    ??\n * May 13–15, 2019 —Particl in NYC — Consensus\n   [https://particl.news/particl-in-nyc-consensus-2019-3f6671bd2aa6] ??\n * June 25–26, 2019 —Particl in San Francisco — Bitcoin2019\n   [https://particl.news/particl-in-san-francisco-bitcoin2019-571fe31fe396] ??\n * Oct. 28–29, 2019 —Particl in Vegas — Money2020\n   [https://particl.news/particl-world-tour-2019-f6e3d3c7e09c] ??\n * Oct. 30, 2019 —Particl in Vegas — World Crypto Conference\n   [https://particl.news/particl-world-tour-2019-f6e3d3c7e09c] ??\n * Oct. 28-Nov. 3, 2019 —Particl in San Francisco — SFBW\n   [https://particl.news/particl-in-san-francisco-sfbw-2019-bdaf0426349a] ??\n * Nov. 14, 2019 —Particl in Singapore — Blockshow\n   [https://particl.news/particl-world-tour-2019-f6e3d3c7e09c] ??\n * Nov. 21–22, 2019 —Particl in Finland — Slush Helsinki\n   [https://particl.news/particl-in-finland-slush-helsinki-1383c1d083c3] ??\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat Can We Take Back From 2019?\nLast year was a year of straight-up delivery with both Particl’s long-awaited\nOpen Marketplace and RingCT (with Bulletproofs) going live on mainnet. More\nimportantly, 2019 will forever be the year where private, free, and borderless\neCommerce became a reality for everyone. A very important milestone in human\ncommerce’s history when you think of it…\n\nIt’s also a year where it became obvious that simply pushing innovative and\nunique blockchain code just doesn’t cut it alone for a project to see great\nsuccess and get decent exposure. And that’s okay, even great, because it signals\nthat the industry is becoming more mature and wants to see blockchain products\nfinally get some “real-world adoption”. That’s the metaphorical “blockchain\nkiller product”, and that’s precisely why Particl is bound to shine moving\nforward!\n\nIn fact, the Open Marketplace is a unique offering — it offers unmatched privacy\nin eCommerce and allows sellers and buyers to connect directly and safely\ntransact by paying almost no fee at all. It takes third-parties (marketplace\noperator, payment processor, web host, etc) totally out of the eCommerce process\nand secures the user’s data and personal information at every step of the way, a\nperk that’s definitely becoming more and more valuable in an era of\never-increasing data mining, breaches, and identity thefts\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/08/20/data-breaches-expose-41-billion-records-in-first-six-months-of-2019/#59551d93bd54]\n.\n\nParticl’s Adoption\nYet, the level of adoption of the marketplace is still relatively low at this\nmoment, a surprising fact for some. That’s due to a few reasons both internal\nand external to Particl, and luckily none of these reasons should really sound\nthe alarm bell.\n\nSome of these reasons are directly due to Particl itself. In fact, the Open\nMarketplace is still very much an early Beta software and is simply not ready\nfor mass adoption just yet. After all, it more than clearly says so in the\nmarketplace’s header banner on Particl Desktop.\n\nAs a matter of fact, some of the processes as well as the user interface of the\nmarketplace are still relatively complicated for most people to use. The\nmarketplace also lacks a few important features usually expected by either\nbuyers or sellers on traditional online marketplaces. In reality, any\nsignificant amount of money invested towards aggressive user adoption campaigns\nwould more than likely result in a poor user adoption rates simply due to the\nearliness of Particl’s product. Getting people to peek around is one thing,\ngetting them to become Particl marketplace users is another thing entirely.\n\nSome of the reasons are also external to Particl. For example, the more than\ntwo-year-long cryptocurrency “bear market” surely hasn’t really encouraged\nlong-term cryptocurrency holders to spend their coins the same way a “bull\nmarket” would…\n\nA New Roadmap is on the Way\nThe very good news is that the Particl team is very aware of its marketplace’s\nbottlenecks! With Market Management, a very major marketplace update, coming out\nin a few weeks, it will mark the completion of a very high-level overview of\nwhat the marketplace was initially imagined to be — an open eCommerce network\npopulated by an infinite amount of markets. In other words, the release of\nMarket Management marks the end of a very particular development phase for the\nproject.\n\nThat being said, that also means that it marks the very beginning of a new\ndevelopment phase, one that will be all about building the right features and\ntools for its targeted users. This new phase will also be all about increasing\nthe marketplace’s accessibility, ease of use, and user interface as much as\npossible. In simple terms, this new phase is all about eliminating any reason\nwhy most people would not buy and/or sell on Particl.\n\nBuckle Up!\nIn the next few days, multiple blog posts will be published on Particl.news\n[http://Particl.news]. They will be a deep dive into the marketplace’s current\nstatus, its level of adoption, and current bottlenecks. They will also explain,\nin detail, the reasoning behind the Particl team’s strategy moving forward as it\njumps in this new decade with both feet. This mini blog post series will\nultimately culminate with the exciting reveal of the new Particl roadmap! Get\nready, as the new roadmap is more than likely to blow a few people’s minds! ?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Particl team would love to thank you all for being part of this very special\nproject and wishes you a very fruitful new decade.

Keep in mind it doesn’t even include Particl Core releases! ?</p><p>Indeed, one particularly impressive aspect of Particl’s development is how <strong>it always keeps its codebase up-to-date with the latest Bitcoin codebase version</strong>. That’s to ensure Particl’s base layer benefits from all the latest Bitcoin improvements so that it can remain secure and can easily integrate any innovation happening in Bitcoin’s world. Put simply, an up-to-date codebase means <strong>security</strong>, <strong>reliability</strong>, <strong>performance</strong>, and <strong>compatibility</strong>.</p><p>And while “keeping the codebase up-to-date” may initially sound like a simple and almost robotic task, there’s definitely a reason barely any Bitcoin-based “altcoin”, if any, properly keeps its codebase up-to-date — it’s a tedious and quite complicated task. That’s because the upstream Bitcoin code needs to be made to fit and be compatible with any added component to Particl’s codebase. It couldn’t further from a simple “copy-paste process”…</p><p>This year, this translated into <strong>19 individual core releases</strong>, a true testament to the constant hard work put in by Particl’s Core Developer &amp; Cryptographic Researcher <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert\"><strong>Tecnovert</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"particl-core-releases-19-total-\">Particl Core Releases (19 total)</h3><ul><li>Jan. 1, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.0\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.0</strong></a></li><li>Feb. 6, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.2\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.2</strong></a></li><li>Feb. 14, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.3\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.3</strong></a></li><li>Mar. 7, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.4\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.4</strong></a></li><li>May 9, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.7\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.7</strong></a></li><li>Jun. 4, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.8\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.8</strong></a></li><li>Jun. 24, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.10\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.10</strong></a></li><li>Jul. 2, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.11\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.11</strong></a></li><li>Jul. 18, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.12\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.12</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 4, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.0\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.0</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 8, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.1\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.1</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 12, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.2\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.2</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 22, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.3\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.3</strong></a></li><li>Sep. 3, 2019 —<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.4\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.4</strong></a></li><li>Sep. 26, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.5\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.5</strong></a></li><li>Oct. 29, 2019 —<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1rc2\"> <strong>Particl Core 0.19.0.1 RC2 (Pre-Release)</strong></a></li><li>Oct. 31, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.6\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.6</strong></a></li><li>Dec. 4, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.7\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.7 (Pre-Release)</strong></a></li><li>Dec. 3, 2019 —<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1\"><strong>Particl Core 0.19.0.1 (Pre-Release)</strong></a></li></ul><hr><h2 id=\"particl-around-the-world\">Particl Around the World</h2><p>Another great move by Particl in 2019 was to increase its boots-on-the-ground presence by attending, sponsoring, and presenting at several blockchain conferences, events, and meetups all around the world.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-s-2019-Year-in-Review/1-Gbg9aHfYJ9bhiThjAvvKwQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Some of Particl’s team after SFBW’s Epicenter conference</figcaption></figure><p>Blockchain events are ideal networking opportunities for teams to find each other, build relationships, and start collaborating on multiple fronts.

Most of the time, it takes many dozens of work hours and conference calls before things fall into place and start moving ahead.

More importantly, 2019 will forever be the year where private, free, and borderless eCommerce became a reality for everyone. A very important milestone in human commerce’s history when you think of it…</p><p>It’s also a year where it became obvious that simply pushing innovative and unique blockchain code just doesn’t cut it alone for a project to see great success and get decent exposure. And that’s okay, even great, because it signals that the industry is becoming more mature and wants to see blockchain products finally get some “real-world adoption”. That’s the metaphorical “blockchain killer product”, and <strong>that’s precisely why Particl is bound to shine moving forward!</strong></p><p>In fact, the Open Marketplace is a unique offering — it offers <strong>unmatched privacy in eCommerce</strong> and <strong>allows sellers and buyers to connect directly and safely transact by paying almost no fee at all</strong>. It takes third-parties (marketplace operator, payment processor, web host, etc) totally out of the eCommerce process and secures the user’s data and personal information at every step of the way, a perk that’s definitely becoming more and more valuable in <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/08/20/data-breaches-expose-41-billion-records-in-first-six-months-of-2019/#59551d93bd54\"><strong>an era of ever-increasing data mining, breaches, and identity thefts</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"particl-s-adoption\">Particl’s Adoption</h3><p>Yet, the level of adoption of the marketplace is still relatively low at this moment, a surprising fact for some. That’s due to a few reasons both internal and external to Particl, and luckily none of these reasons should really sound the alarm bell.</p><p><strong>Some of these reasons are directly due to Particl itself</strong>. In fact, the Open Marketplace is still very much an <strong>early Beta software</strong> and is simply not ready for mass adoption just yet. After all, it more than clearly says so in the marketplace’s header banner on Particl Desktop.</p><p>As a matter of fact, some of the processes as well as the user interface of the marketplace are still relatively complicated for most people to use. The marketplace also lacks a few important features usually expected by either buyers or sellers on traditional online marketplaces. In reality, any significant amount of money invested towards aggressive user adoption campaigns would more than likely result in a poor user adoption rates simply due to the earliness of Particl’s product. Getting people to peek around is one thing, getting them to become Particl marketplace users is another thing entirely.</p><p><strong>Some of the reasons are also external to Particl</strong>. For example, the more than two-year-long cryptocurrency “bear market” surely hasn’t really encouraged long-term cryptocurrency holders to spend their coins the same way a “bull market” would…</p><h2 id=\"a-new-roadmap-is-on-the-way\">A New Roadmap is on the Way</h2><p>The very good news is that the Particl team is very aware of its marketplace’s bottlenecks! With Market Management, a very major marketplace update, coming out in a few weeks, it will mark the completion of a very high-level overview of what the marketplace was initially imagined to be — an open eCommerce network populated by an infinite amount of markets. In other words, the release of Market Management marks the end of a very particular development phase for the project.</p><p>That being said, that also means that it marks the very beginning of a new development phase, one that will be all about building the right features and tools for its targeted users. This new phase will also be all about increasing the marketplace’s accessibility, ease of use, and user interface as much as possible. <strong>In simple terms, this new phase is all about eliminating any reason why most people would not buy and/or sell on Particl.</strong></p><h3 id=\"buckle-up-\">Buckle Up!</h3><p>In the next few days, multiple blog posts will be published on <a href=\"http://Particl.news\"><strong>Particl.news</strong></a>. They will be a deep dive into the marketplace’s current status, its level of adoption, and current bottlenecks. They will also explain, in detail, the reasoning behind the Particl team’s strategy moving forward as it jumps in this new decade with both feet. <strong>This mini blog post series will ultimately culminate with the exciting reveal of the new Particl roadmap! </strong>Get ready, as the new roadmap is more than likely to blow a few people’s minds! ?</p><hr><p>The Particl team would love to thank you all for being part of this very special project and wishes you a very fruitful new decade.

Keep in mind it doesn’t even include Particl Core releases! ?</p><p>Indeed, one particularly impressive aspect of Particl’s development is how <strong>it always keeps its codebase up-to-date with the latest Bitcoin codebase version</strong>. That’s to ensure Particl’s base layer benefits from all the latest Bitcoin improvements so that it can remain secure and can easily integrate any innovation happening in Bitcoin’s world. Put simply, an up-to-date codebase means <strong>security</strong>, <strong>reliability</strong>, <strong>performance</strong>, and <strong>compatibility</strong>.</p><p>And while “keeping the codebase up-to-date” may initially sound like a simple and almost robotic task, there’s definitely a reason barely any Bitcoin-based “altcoin”, if any, properly keeps its codebase up-to-date — it’s a tedious and quite complicated task. That’s because the upstream Bitcoin code needs to be made to fit and be compatible with any added component to Particl’s codebase. It couldn’t further from a simple “copy-paste process”…</p><p>This year, this translated into <strong>19 individual core releases</strong>, a true testament to the constant hard work put in by Particl’s Core Developer &#x26; Cryptographic Researcher <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert\"><strong>Tecnovert</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"particl-core-releases-19-total-\">Particl Core Releases (19 total)</h3><ul><li>Jan. 1, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.0\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.0</strong></a></li><li>Feb. 6, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.2\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.2</strong></a></li><li>Feb. 14, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.3\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.3</strong></a></li><li>Mar. 7, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.1.4\"><strong>Particl Core 0.17.1.4</strong></a></li><li>May 9, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.7\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.7</strong></a></li><li>Jun. 4, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.8\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.8</strong></a></li><li>Jun. 24, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.10\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.10</strong></a></li><li>Jul. 2, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.11\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.11</strong></a></li><li>Jul. 18, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.0.12\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.0.12</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 4, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.0\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.0</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 8, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.1\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.1</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 12, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.2\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.2</strong></a></li><li>Aug. 22, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.3\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.3</strong></a></li><li>Sep. 3, 2019 —<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.4\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.4</strong></a></li><li>Sep. 26, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.5\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.5</strong></a></li><li>Oct. 29, 2019 —<a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1rc2\"> <strong>Particl Core 0.19.0.1 RC2 (Pre-Release)</strong></a></li><li>Oct. 31, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.6\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.6</strong></a></li><li>Dec. 4, 2019 — <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.18.1.7\"><strong>Particl Core 0.18.1.7 (Pre-Release)</strong></a></li><li>Dec. 3, 2019 —<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.0.1\"><strong>Particl Core 0.19.0.1 (Pre-Release)</strong></a></li></ul><hr><h2 id=\"particl-around-the-world\">Particl Around the World</h2><p>Another great move by Particl in 2019 was to increase its boots-on-the-ground presence by attending, sponsoring, and presenting at several blockchain conferences, events, and meetups all around the world.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-2019-Year-in-Review/1-Gbg9aHfYJ9bhiThjAvvKwQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Some of Particl’s team after SFBW’s Epicenter conference</figcaption></figure><p>Blockchain events are ideal networking opportunities for teams to find each other, build relationships, and start collaborating on multiple fronts.

More importantly, 2019 will forever be the year where private, free, and borderless eCommerce became a reality for everyone. A very important milestone in human commerce’s history when you think of it…</p><p>It’s also a year where it became obvious that simply pushing innovative and unique blockchain code just doesn’t cut it alone for a project to see great success and get decent exposure. And that’s okay, even great, because it signals that the industry is becoming more mature and wants to see blockchain products finally get some “real-world adoption”. That’s the metaphorical “blockchain killer product”, and <strong>that’s precisely why Particl is bound to shine moving forward!</strong></p><p>In fact, the Open Marketplace is a unique offering — it offers <strong>unmatched privacy in eCommerce</strong> and <strong>allows sellers and buyers to connect directly and safely transact by paying almost no fee at all</strong>. It takes third-parties (marketplace operator, payment processor, web host, etc) totally out of the eCommerce process and secures the user’s data and personal information at every step of the way, a perk that’s definitely becoming more and more valuable in <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/08/20/data-breaches-expose-41-billion-records-in-first-six-months-of-2019/#59551d93bd54\"><strong>an era of ever-increasing data mining, breaches, and identity thefts</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"particl-s-adoption\">Particl’s Adoption</h3><p>Yet, the level of adoption of the marketplace is still relatively low at this moment, a surprising fact for some. That’s due to a few reasons both internal and external to Particl, and luckily none of these reasons should really sound the alarm bell.</p><p><strong>Some of these reasons are directly due to Particl itself</strong>. In fact, the Open Marketplace is still very much an <strong>early Beta software</strong> and is simply not ready for mass adoption just yet. After all, it more than clearly says so in the marketplace’s header banner on Particl Desktop.</p><p>As a matter of fact, some of the processes as well as the user interface of the marketplace are still relatively complicated for most people to use. The marketplace also lacks a few important features usually expected by either buyers or sellers on traditional online marketplaces. In reality, any significant amount of money invested towards aggressive user adoption campaigns would more than likely result in a poor user adoption rates simply due to the earliness of Particl’s product. Getting people to peek around is one thing, getting them to become Particl marketplace users is another thing entirely.</p><p><strong>Some of the reasons are also external to Particl</strong>. For example, the more than two-year-long cryptocurrency “bear market” surely hasn’t really encouraged long-term cryptocurrency holders to spend their coins the same way a “bull market” would…</p><h2 id=\"a-new-roadmap-is-on-the-way\">A New Roadmap is on the Way</h2><p>The very good news is that the Particl team is very aware of its marketplace’s bottlenecks! With Market Management, a very major marketplace update, coming out in a few weeks, it will mark the completion of a very high-level overview of what the marketplace was initially imagined to be — an open eCommerce network populated by an infinite amount of markets. In other words, the release of Market Management marks the end of a very particular development phase for the project.</p><p>That being said, that also means that it marks the very beginning of a new development phase, one that will be all about building the right features and tools for its targeted users. This new phase will also be all about increasing the marketplace’s accessibility, ease of use, and user interface as much as possible. <strong>In simple terms, this new phase is all about eliminating any reason why most people would not buy and/or sell on Particl.</strong></p><h3 id=\"buckle-up-\">Buckle Up!</h3><p>In the next few days, multiple blog posts will be published on <a href=\"http://Particl.news\"><strong>Particl.news</strong></a>. They will be a deep dive into the marketplace’s current status, its level of adoption, and current bottlenecks. They will also explain, in detail, the reasoning behind the Particl team’s strategy moving forward as it jumps in this new decade with both feet. <strong>This mini blog post series will ultimately culminate with the exciting reveal of the new Particl roadmap! </strong>Get ready, as the new roadmap is more than likely to blow a few people’s minds! ?</p><hr><p>The Particl team would love to thank you all for being part of this very special project and wishes you a very fruitful new decade.

To eliminate the obstacles\nstanding in the way of Particl’s marketplace adoption, the team has been on a\nvery focused path to deliver a whole range of key features that would make the\nOpen Marketplace user-friendly enough to be considered “adoption-ready” by, in\nthe first place, the crypto community, and then by wider audiences not\nnecessarily in crypto.\n\nChoose a Market While Browsing Listings (WIP, Subject to Change)The Particl team\nis excited to announce that the Market Management functionality will be the next\nbig marketplace feature and is likely to be part of Particl Desktop 2.4.0.\n\n> Note: The information and graphic designs shown in this blog post are still in\nprogress and subject to change.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Content (Market Management Section)\n * What’s “Market Management”?\n * Seller Profile and Identities\n * Market Browser\n * Create a New Market or Storefront\n * Promote a Market\n * Market Governance\n * Market Management Development Status\n * What’s Next After Market Management?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Road Towards a Better Marketplace Adoption\nParticl has been onto a journey to eliminate the obstacles in the way of\nParticl’s adoption. With this very focused objective in mind, developers have\nbeen hard at work to bring forward the key features required before the Open\nMarketplace becomes “adoption-ready”. And things have been moving pretty fast!\n\nBitcoin to be Accepted on Particl\nIn-wallet Bitcoin Exchange (Mainnet Screenshot)On November 1st, Particl announced the upcoming integration of an in-wallet\nexchange module [https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190359593550901248] \nto make it super easy for shoppers to buy anything on the marketplace using\nBitcoin. In fact, this new feature is so close to being released that the\nParticl team members flying out to the Slush Helsinki conference have brought\nwith them private builds of the Open Marketplace, on mainnet, WITH the Bitcoin\nexchange module included\n[https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1197137822261665792]. Additionally,\nsince earlier today, the build that they have brought with them is also\navailable on testnet\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.0] for everyone to\nplay with.\n\nThis new exchange module, made possible thanks to a brand new SMSG-powered bot\nintegrated right into Particl Desktop, also marks the first step towards\nincluding many more currencies on Particl’s Open Marketplace. This is a critical\nfeature that will allow almost any cryptocurrency user to be able to shop\nonline, on Particl, without fees and without putting any of their personal\ninformation or data at risk. Just swap your coins for Particl right from Particl\nDesktop!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMarket Management is Next!\nThe Particl team is taking no time in between major feature releases and is now\nworking on the final integration tweaks required for the Market Management\nfeature to be ready. This major Particl feature will drastically change how the\nOpen Marketplace is interacted with and open up a ton of possibilities for\nsellers and buyers both.\n\nWhat’s “Market Management”?\nMarket Management is a new tool that significantly changes how Particl’s\nmarketplace behaves and is interacted with. It is, simply put, an added\nfunctionality that allows anyone to create public or private user markets and\nstorefronts. Whereas Particl’s Open Marketplace used to be the only Particl\nmarketplace available, it will now be one out of an infinite amount of user\nmarkets or storefronts that anyone can create. It will, however, remain as the\ndefault marketplace, meaning anyone installing Particl Desktop will have access\nto and see this giant public marketplace.\n\n> For the purpose of this article, “markets and storefronts” will simply be\nreferred to as “markets”.\nWhile the above section quickly describes the new Market Management capabilities\nof Particl’s marketplace, you probably want to know more about what’s coming up,\nright?. In fact, Market Management required quite a bit of refactoring (updating\nthe code and changing parts of its structure), and so with its introductions\ncomes a vast amount of new features and UI/UX changes.\n\n> Let’s walk through the main components of what makes up Market Management.\nSeller Profiles and Identities\nSeller profiles and identities are one of the most important changes brought\nforth by Market Management and is a completely new concept being introduced.\n\nSeller profiles, identities, and market in short…The seller profile: A seller profile represents one user on the marketplace and\nmany profiles can be set up on the same Particl Desktop client. It can be\nconnected to multiple markets or storefronts at once and be used to create an\ninfinite number of markets. Each time the profile connects to a market or\ncreates one, it associates an identity to it that is then used to transact. A\nseller profile can contain an infinite amount of identities, if desired.\n\nIdentities: Identities are essentially Particl wallets. An identity’s public key\nis used to view markets, purchase products on them, and moderate its content\nwhile the private key is used to list products on them and process orders. A\nprofile can have multiple identities and easily choose which identity is used to\ncreate a market.\n\nIdentities can be used to associate different markets with the same seller. That\ncan either be a good thing for sellers looking to build up a solid reputation or\nexpose their branding to different markets, but for those looking for the\nmaximum level of privacy, it is recommended to use a different identity every\ntime you create a new market. It is not possible to tie different identities\ntogether nor is it possible to associate identities with their seller profile.\n\nTo sum it up, a seller profile represents one “real-world” online seller. This\nseller can connect to and create an infinite amount of markets and storefronts.\nEach market can be independently connected to an infinite amount of identities\nwhich cannot be traced back to the main seller profile.\n\n> Note: Seller profiles will mostly be a back-end function for the first version\nof Market Management, meaning they won’t really be visible from inside the\nwallet.\nMarket Browser\nAnother huge component of the Market Management tool is the Market Browser — a\ncompletely new section of Particl Desktop where you can browse, join, manage,\nflag, and promote markets. This is the central point of command of the Market\nManagement tool and is separated into three distinct categories.\n\nMarket Browser (WIP, subject to change)Available Markets: The Available tab of the Market Browser displays all publicly\navailable markets. In other words, it gives you quick access to all the markets\nthat have been either publicly listed or promoted on the Market Browser. The\nAvailable tab is also the place where you can manually connect to markets and\nstorefronts not publicly listed on the Market Browser by entering their Market\nID. It also gives you the Market ID of all available markets it displays so that\nyou can easily share them with other people.\n\nJoined Markets: The Joined tab is where all markets and storefronts that you\nhave joined can be accessed. Here, you can browse, promote, or report markets\nwith a few simple clicks, and also join any market by entering its access code\n(the “Market ID”).\n\nYour markets: The Your Markets tab is where you can browse, manage, and promote\nmarkets created or administered by you. This section is also where you want to\ngo if you want to create a brand market of your own.\n\nCreate a New Market or Storefront\nCreate a New Market (WIP, Subject to Change)Market Management gives you the\nability to create or join an unlimited number of markets and personalize them by\nchoosing a logo, title, and description so that other people know what they’ll\nfind in it. These markets are pretty flexible and have their own parameters and\npermissions that can be set up by the creator at the moment of creation. Put\nsimply, markets can be either be publicly listed or not, and also either be a\nregular market or storefront with attributable administrator rights.\n\nPublicly listed or not? Markets on Particl can either be publicly listed on the\nMarket Browser or not. By default, new markets aren’t listed on the Market\nBrowser, making them known and accessible only by those who know its access code\n(the “Market ID”) and uses it to connect their Particl Desktop client to it.\nWhen a market isn’t listed on the Market Browser, it is impossible for anyone\nthat doesn’t know the access code to even know it exists in the first place. To\nbe publicly listed on the Market Browser and be accessible to anyone running\nParticl, a market has to be “listed”, for a small market listing/promotion fee\nthat is then redistributed to stakers.\n\nA “public” market refers to a market that has been listed on the Market Browser\nby its creator. That means anyone running Particl Desktop can easily find public\nmarkets just by browsing the list of publicly available markets and without\nhaving to know its access code (“Market ID”).\n\nMarket or Storefront? When creating a market, it is possible to set it up as two\ndifferent types — either a regular, “open” market or a storefront. These two\ntypes of markets are actually very similar, the only difference being that\nanyone who has joined a market can publish listings and and sell products\nwhereas only the creator of a storefront, and its administrators, can do it.\n\nIn fact, storefronts are basically shops that any seller or group of sellers can\nset up. Only the seller that sets up a storefront, and the ones that have been\ngiven the rights to sell by the creator, can list products and process orders.\nFor more precision, while any seller with the rights to sell on a storefront can\npublish listings on it, they will only be able to process orders for items that\nthey have posted themselves. Sellers cannot, at least for the first version of\nMarket Management, process orders on behalf of other sellers of a given\nstorefront.\n\nStorefronts are how businesses and brands can set up their own stores,\npersonalize them, and get vetted sellers to publish listings on them. They are\nalso ideal for seller/buyer communities to form around a specific market.\n\nJust like with markets, storefronts can either be publicly listed on the Market\nBrowser or not.\n\nPromote a Market\nPromoting a market lists it on top of the Market Browser and adds a “promoted”\nicon next to it. Anyone with access to a certain market can promote it by paying\na small promotion fee that is then redistributed, in full, to stakers of the\nParticl network.\n\nMarket Governance\nEvery market or storefront on Particl is subject to the exact same user\ngovernance mechanism as the listings are. That means anyone with access to a\nmarket can report it as inappropriate so that it can get taken off Particl when\ntoo many people report it.\n\nMarket Management Development Status\nThe marketplace development team is just about to wrap up the back-end code of\nthe Market Management as well as the test cases required to make sure everything\nis smooth. These are expected to be completed shortly after the Slush Helsinki\nconference. Then, the team will begin the GUI integration and run that last few\ntests before releasing the feature on testnet. Stay ready!\n\n> Note: Some Market Management functions and UI/UX may change during the GUI\nintegration and end up looking different than what has been displayed in this\nblog post.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Next?\nMarket Management is getting closer to be ready, so it’s normal to wonder what\nare going to be the next major pieces to come on Particl after it. Here are two\nof the most immediate items on the team’s list, but know that more may be added\nsoon and that smaller items may be worked on in parallel.\n\nInventory Management\nPreview of Preliminary Inventory Management Designs (WIP, Subject to Change)The\nInventory Management tool is one of the next big pieces planned to be added to\nthe marketplace after Market Management. This will add quantity and inventory\nmanagement capabilities to Particl Desktop and give sellers the ability to sell\npre-determined amounts of items.\n\nOn the buyer side, it will also allow shoppers to buy the same listing multiple\ntimes without requiring the seller to create new listings.\n\nInventory Management is also expected to bring in a live environment some of the\nfirst OMP Library functions required for listings to have custom fields (i.e.\nchoosing the colour or size of a shirt right from the listing).\n\nAdjustable Escrow\nAnother key feature required to make seller adoption way easier is the ability\nto adjust the escrow rate. Right now, when buying an item, both the seller and\nthe buyer need to temporarily lock in escrow a security deposit equal to 100% of\nthe value of the item being purchased.\n\nWith an adjustable escrow, sellers could require the buyer to only put 10% of\nthe value of the item being purchased, for example. They could also set up the\nescrow with a 0% rate, meaning neither the buyer nor the seller would be\nrequired to temporarily lock any funds in escrow.\n\nA lower escrow rate takes out some of the game-theory involved in the double\ndeposit escrow system. An escrow rate of 0% takes it off entirely. This is far\nfrom ideal when purchasing from a seller that you don’t know, don’t trust, or\nthat has a shaky or disputed reputation.\n\nFor sellers with a solid reputation or customer base though, they might not need\nthe escrow, or even want it, as it requires them to constantly lock up funds for\neach sale. Furthermore, big and trusted brands might be more trusted by their\ncustomers then untrusted, meaning locking up funds in escrow may be something\ncustomers would like to bypass as well.\n\nLet’s take a very simple and obvious example: Apple. If Apple were to sell\nproducts on Particl, they probably wouldn’t want to deal with the escrow. They\nhave a large customer base that trusts them and they would fix any potential\nissue the same way they would usually do it. After all, a big brand like Apple\nselling on Particl would still need to follow the regular seller guidelines and\nconsumer protection policies of their respective jurisdiction, so in that\nspecific case, the escrow only ends up being an obstacle to adoption for Apprle\nand not a real benefit for any of the two transacting parties (Apple and the\ncustomer).\n\nIt is also being discussed that the escrow might be eventually made optional and\nthat you could opt-out of it when creating a listing. Taking the escrow out\nentirely of a transaction, and not just setting it up to 0%, would have the\nadded benefit of taking out a few steps of the buy flow, simplifying the process\nof buying and selling something on Particl and making possible something like\nautomatic processing and delivery of digital items.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is alive and kicking, and there’s no stopping it! As we head into 2020,\nyou’ll start getting used to more constant and faster releases, almost all of\nthem bringing new features and noticeable improvements.\n\nAs always, the team appreciates any help it can get, whether it’s through\ncommunity testing, functionality/feature suggestions, or just general feedback\nof the user experience of the Particl platform. Every single bit helps! It is by\ncollecting as many different perspectives and points of view that the\nmarketplace will get better. If you encounter any issue or have feedback for the\ndevelopers, never hesitate to log an issue on Github by clicking on the “Report\na bug” icon at the bottom left of the Particl Desktop client, or simply by\nfollowing this link: https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues. This is\nthe simplest way to voice your opinion and a sure way for you to make sure the\ndevelopers will see it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Market-Management-is-Next-/1-HD9QKfTUuqqxOx30CYDCBg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"create-and-join-an-unlimited-number-of-markets-\">Create and Join an Unlimited Number of Markets ?</h3><p>The Particl team is moving fast and methodically!

This is a critical feature that will allow almost any cryptocurrency user to be able to shop online, on Particl, without fees and without putting any of their personal information or data at risk. Just swap your coins for Particl right from Particl Desktop!</p><hr><h2 id=\"market-management-is-next-\">Market Management is Next!</h2><p>The Particl team is taking no time in between major feature releases and is now working on the final integration tweaks required for the Market Management feature to be ready. This major Particl feature will drastically change how the Open Marketplace is interacted with and open up a ton of possibilities for sellers and buyers both.</p><h3 id=\"what-s-market-management-\"><strong>What’s “Market Management”?</strong></h3><p>Market Management is a new tool that significantly changes how Particl’s marketplace behaves and is interacted with. It is, simply put, <strong>an added functionality that allows anyone to create public or private user markets and storefronts.</strong> Whereas Particl’s Open Marketplace used to be the only Particl marketplace available,<strong> it will now be one out of an infinite amount of user markets or storefronts that anyone can create</strong>. It will, however, remain as the default marketplace, meaning anyone installing Particl Desktop will have access to and see this giant public marketplace.</p><blockquote>For the purpose of this article, “markets and storefronts” will simply be referred to as “markets”.</blockquote><p>While the above section quickly describes the new Market Management capabilities of Particl’s marketplace, you probably want to know more about what’s coming up, right?. In fact, Market Management required quite a bit of refactoring (updating the code and changing parts of its structure), and so with its introductions comes a vast amount of new features and UI/UX changes.</p><blockquote>Let’s walk through the main components of what makes up Market Management.</blockquote><h3 id=\"seller-profiles-and-identities\">Seller Profiles and Identities</h3><p>Seller profiles and identities are one of the most important changes brought forth by Market Management and is a completely new concept being introduced.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Market-Management-is-Next-/1-C66uBOkpLRs_j0H7ytHaJQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Seller profiles, identities, and market in short…</figcaption></figure><p><strong>The seller profile:</strong> A seller profile represents one user on the marketplace and many profiles can be set up on the same Particl Desktop client. It can be connected to multiple markets or storefronts at once and be used to create an infinite number of markets. Each time the profile connects to a market or creates one, it associates an identity to it that is then used to transact. A seller profile can contain an infinite amount of identities, if desired.</p><p><strong>Identities:</strong> Identities are essentially Particl wallets. An identity’s public key is used to view markets, purchase products on them, and moderate its content while the private key is used to list products on them and process orders. A profile can have multiple identities and easily choose which identity is used to create a market.</p><p>Identities can be used to associate different markets with the same seller. That can either be a good thing for sellers looking to build up a solid reputation or expose their branding to different markets, but for those looking for the maximum level of privacy, it is recommended to use a different identity every time you create a new market. It is not possible to tie different identities together nor is it possible to associate identities with their seller profile.</p><p><strong>To sum it up</strong>, a seller profile represents one “real-world” online seller. This seller can connect to and create an infinite amount of markets and storefronts. Each market can be independently connected to an infinite amount of identities which cannot be traced back to the main seller profile.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Seller profiles will mostly be a back-end function for the first version of Market Management, meaning they won’t really be visible from inside the wallet.</blockquote><h3 id=\"market-browser\">Market Browser</h3><p>Another huge component of the Market Management tool is the Market Browser — a completely new section of Particl Desktop where you can browse, join, manage, flag, and promote markets. This is the central point of command of the Market Management tool and is separated into three distinct categories.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Market-Management-is-Next-/1-K0kMclqwOPZkJo5ffunCGg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Market Browser (WIP, subject to change)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Available Markets:</strong> The Available tab of the Market Browser displays all publicly available markets. In other words, it gives you quick access to all the markets that have been either publicly listed or promoted on the Market Browser. The Available tab is also the place where you can manually connect to markets and storefronts not publicly listed on the Market Browser by entering their Market ID. It also gives you the Market ID of all available markets it displays so that you can easily share them with other people.</p><p><strong>Joined Markets: </strong>The Joined tab is where all markets and storefronts that you have joined can be accessed.

It is, simply put, <strong>an added functionality that allows anyone to create public or private user markets and storefronts.</strong> Whereas Particl’s Open Marketplace used to be the only Particl marketplace available,<strong> it will now be one out of an infinite amount of user markets or storefronts that anyone can create</strong>. It will, however, remain as the default marketplace, meaning anyone installing Particl Desktop will have access to and see this giant public marketplace.</p><blockquote>For the purpose of this article, “markets and storefronts” will simply be referred to as “markets”.</blockquote><p>While the above section quickly describes the new Market Management capabilities of Particl’s marketplace, you probably want to know more about what’s coming up, right?. In fact, Market Management required quite a bit of refactoring (updating the code and changing parts of its structure), and so with its introductions comes a vast amount of new features and UI/UX changes.</p><blockquote>Let’s walk through the main components of what makes up Market Management.</blockquote><h3 id=\"seller-profiles-and-identities\">Seller Profiles and Identities</h3><p>Seller profiles and identities are one of the most important changes brought forth by Market Management and is a completely new concept being introduced.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Market-Management-is-Next-/1-C66uBOkpLRs_j0H7ytHaJQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Seller profiles, identities, and market in short…</figcaption></figure><p><strong>The seller profile:</strong> A seller profile represents one user on the marketplace and many profiles can be set up on the same Particl Desktop client. It can be connected to multiple markets or storefronts at once and be used to create an infinite number of markets.

A seller profile can contain an infinite amount of identities, if desired.</p><p><strong>Identities:</strong> Identities are essentially Particl wallets.

This is the central point of command of the Market Management tool and is separated into three distinct categories.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Market-Management-is-Next-/1-K0kMclqwOPZkJo5ffunCGg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Market Browser (WIP, subject to change)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Available Markets:</strong> The Available tab of the Market Browser displays all publicly available markets. In other words, it gives you quick access to all the markets that have been either publicly listed or promoted on the Market Browser. The Available tab is also the place where you can manually connect to markets and storefronts not publicly listed on the Market Browser by entering their Market ID. It also gives you the Market ID of all available markets it displays so that you can easily share them with other people.</p><p><strong>Joined Markets: </strong>The Joined tab is where all markets and storefronts that you have joined can be accessed. Here, you can browse, promote, or report markets with a few simple clicks, and also join any market by entering its access code (the “Market ID”).</p><p><strong>Your markets:</strong> The Your Markets tab is where you can browse, manage, and promote markets created or administered by you. This section is also where you want to go if you want to create a brand market of your own.</p><h3 id=\"create-a-new-market-or-storefront\">Create a New Market or Storefront</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Market-Management-is-Next-/1-6HRfeYPykMHYnb46Bu_gXQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Create a New Market (WIP, Subject to Change)</figcaption></figure><p>Market Management gives you the ability to create or join an unlimited number of markets and personalize them by choosing a logo, title, and description so that other people know what they’ll find in it. These markets are pretty flexible and have their own parameters and permissions that can be set up by the creator at the moment of creation. Put simply, markets can be either be publicly listed or not, and also either be a regular market or storefront with attributable administrator rights.</p><p><strong>Publicly listed or not? </strong>Markets on Particl can either be publicly listed on the Market Browser or not. By default, new markets aren’t listed on the Market Browser, making them known and accessible only by those who know its access code (the “Market ID”) and uses it to connect their Particl Desktop client to it. When a market isn’t listed on the Market Browser, it is impossible for anyone that doesn’t know the access code to even know it exists in the first place. To be publicly listed on the Market Browser and be accessible to anyone running Particl, a market has to be “listed”, <strong>for a small market listing/promotion fee that is then redistributed to stakers.</strong></p><p>A <strong>“public”</strong> market refers to a market that has been listed on the Market Browser by its creator. That means anyone running Particl Desktop can easily find public markets just by browsing the list of publicly available markets and without having to know its access code (“Market ID”).</p><p><strong>Market or Storefront?</strong> When creating a market, it is possible to set it up as two different types — either a regular, “open” market or a storefront. These two types of markets are actually very similar, the only difference being that anyone who has joined a market can publish listings and and sell products whereas only the creator of a storefront, and its administrators, can do it.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Market-Management-is-Next-/1-bvwUL0TWSKaQ6ba9V7dCNg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>In fact, <strong>storefronts </strong>are basically shops that any seller or group of sellers can set up. Only the seller that sets up a storefront, and the ones that have been given the rights to sell by the creator, can list products and process orders. For more precision, while any seller with the rights to sell on a storefront can publish listings on it, they will only be able to process orders for items that they have posted themselves. Sellers cannot, at least for the first version of Market Management, process orders on behalf of other sellers of a given storefront.</p><p>Storefronts are how businesses and brands can set up their own stores, personalize them, and get vetted sellers to publish listings on them. They are also ideal for seller/buyer communities to form around a specific market.</p><p>Just like with markets, storefronts can either be publicly listed on the Market Browser or not.</p><h3 id=\"promote-a-market\">Promote a Market</h3><p>Promoting a market lists it on top of the Market Browser and adds a “promoted” icon next to it. Anyone with access to a certain market can promote it by paying a small promotion fee that is then redistributed, in full, to stakers of the Particl network.</p><h3 id=\"market-governance\">Market Governance</h3><p>Every market or storefront on Particl is subject to the exact same user governance mechanism as the listings are. That means anyone with access to a market can report it as inappropriate so that it can get taken off Particl when too many people report it.</p><h3 id=\"market-management-development-status\">Market Management Development Status</h3><p>The marketplace development team is just about to wrap up the back-end code of the Market Management as well as the test cases required to make sure everything is smooth. These are expected to be completed shortly after the Slush Helsinki conference. Then, the team will begin the GUI integration and run that last few tests before releasing the feature on testnet. Stay ready!</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Some Market Management functions and UI/UX may change during the GUI integration and end up looking different than what has been displayed in this blog post.</blockquote><hr><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s Next?</h2><p>Market Management is getting closer to be ready, so it’s normal to wonder what are going to be the next major pieces to come on Particl after it. Here are two of the most immediate items on the team’s list, but know that more may be added soon and that smaller items may be worked on in parallel.</p><h3 id=\"inventory-management\">Inventory Management</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Market-Management-is-Next-/1-knGEEEDMYRZ-yVxf3Uf8Ww.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Preview of Preliminary Inventory Management Designs (WIP, Subject to Change)</figcaption></figure><p>The Inventory Management tool is one of the next big pieces planned to be added to the marketplace after Market Management. This will add quantity and inventory management capabilities to Particl Desktop and give sellers the ability to sell pre-determined amounts of items.</p><p>On the buyer side, it will also allow shoppers to buy the same listing multiple times without requiring the seller to create new listings.</p><p>Inventory Management is also expected to bring in a live environment some of the first OMP Library functions required for listings to have custom fields (i.e. choosing the colour or size of a shirt right from the listing).</p><h3 id=\"adjustable-escrow\">Adjustable Escrow</h3><p>Another key feature required to make seller adoption way easier is the ability to adjust the escrow rate. Right now, when buying an item, both the seller and the buyer need to temporarily lock in escrow a security deposit equal to 100% of the value of the item being purchased.</p><p>With an adjustable escrow, sellers could require the buyer to only put 10% of the value of the item being purchased, for example. They could also set up the escrow with a 0% rate, meaning neither the buyer nor the seller would be required to temporarily lock any funds in escrow.</p><p>A lower escrow rate takes out some of the game-theory involved in the double deposit escrow system. An escrow rate of 0% takes it off entirely. This is far from ideal when purchasing from a seller that you don’t know, don’t trust, or that has a shaky or disputed reputation.</p><p>For sellers with a solid reputation or customer base though, they might not need the escrow, or even want it, as it requires them to constantly lock up funds for each sale. Furthermore, big and trusted brands might be more trusted by their customers then untrusted, meaning locking up funds in escrow may be something customers would like to bypass as well.</p><p>Let’s take a very simple and obvious example: Apple. If Apple were to sell products on Particl, they probably wouldn’t want to deal with the escrow. They have a large customer base that trusts them and they would fix any potential issue the same way they would usually do it. After all, a big brand like Apple selling on Particl would still need to follow the regular seller guidelines and consumer protection policies of their respective jurisdiction, so in that specific case, the escrow only ends up being an obstacle to adoption for Apprle and not a real benefit for any of the two transacting parties (Apple and the customer).</p><p>It is also being discussed that the escrow might be eventually made optional and that you could opt-out of it when creating a listing. Taking the escrow out entirely of a transaction, and not just setting it up to 0%, would have the added benefit of taking out a few steps of the buy flow, simplifying the process of buying and selling something on Particl and making possible something like automatic processing and delivery of digital items.</p><hr><p>Particl is alive and kicking, and there’s no stopping it! As we head into 2020, you’ll start getting used to more constant and faster releases, almost all of them bringing new features and noticeable improvements.</p><p>As always, the team appreciates any help it can get, whether it’s through community testing, functionality/feature suggestions, or just general feedback of the user experience of the Particl platform. Every single bit helps! It is by collecting as many different perspectives and points of view that the marketplace will get better.

After all, a big brand like Apple selling on Particl would still need to follow the regular seller guidelines and consumer protection policies of their respective jurisdiction, so in that specific case, the escrow only ends up being an obstacle to adoption for Apprle and not a real benefit for any of the two transacting parties (Apple and the customer)."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"It is also being discussed that the escrow might be eventually made optional and that you could opt-out of it when creating a listing.

Woods is\na veteran with more than 18 years of experience in the technical and payment\nindustries. He brings extensive expertise and reach within the retail and\nconsumer markets and will pro-actively work in bridging the gap between the\ntraditional finance sector and cryptocurrency.\n\nMr. Woods will advise Particl on the opportunities to disrupt the fintech\nindustry that are currently being opened up by distributed technologies and how\nbest to capitalize on them. In addition, Woods will actively work on realizing\nthese opportunities by tapping right into his vast network of merchants and\nbusinesses and connect them with Particl for its world-class technologies and\ndecentralized services.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Case for Connecting Fintech Businesses to Particl\nMany businesses, like tech companies operating outside the cryptocurrency\nindustry but actively looking to modernize and optimize their business flow, can\nbenefit from Particl’s range of decentralized services. For example, a business\nmay simply want to accept cryptocurrency payments, but another may also need to\ntransfer data securely and privately, without third-party custody of the data.\nIn that case, they could use Particl’s peer-to-peer data storage network called\nSMSG and integrate it into their model.\n\nOnline retailers, who constantly need to lower their costs or worry about the\nprivacy and security of their data may want to open shop and sell products on\nParticl’s decentralized and private-by-default marketplace. After all, it\ncharges no commission! Other companies may only have a need for Particl’s double\ndeposit escrow system to keep certain parties in check with each other.\n\n> “Through his many years working right in the heart of the payment industry,\nBryan has developed lasting relationships with many businesses that are\ncurrently looking for ways to implement distributed technologies.Bryan will be\nworking closely with Particl to advise on the exact needs and requirements of\nthese companies and actively help onboarding them with Particl’s wide array of\ndecentralized services.” —Gerlof van Ek, Co-Founder at Particl\n\nIn fact, most businesses have surprisingly high levels of inefficiencies. This\ncosts them profits, time, and opportunities. Some of these hurdles are caused by\nhuman activity, regulations, politics, but some of them are also caused by\ntechnological bottlenecks. Coincidentally, it appears that more and more\nbusinesses realize the potential that distributed technologies present (P2P,\nblockchain). Of course, most of them would never dare, nor need to, go “full\ncrypto”, but just the right amount of distributed technology at the right place\nwithin their operations can make all the difference.\n\nThis shift of mentality within the traditional finance industry is opening up a\nlot of doors, and this is the opportunity that Bryan Woods wants to seize, with\nParticl.\n\n> Note: While Particl has already met and been introduced to some businesses\nwithin Bryan’s network, it may still take some time until the first few\nimplementations are ready and deployed. It is not impossible that the first few\ndeployments will occur in early 2020, as opposed to 2019. As always, follow\nParticl.news to not miss any update!\nLeveraging Spend.com’s Technology\nThe coming of Bryan as an advisor also opens up many interplay opportunities\nbetween both Spend and Particl’s ecosystems.\n\nSpend is a next-generation banking ecosystem with tens of thousands of active\nusers. It acts as a fiat gateway and “banking services 2.0\" provider. Its\nall-in-one mobile application allows you to hold, transfer, deposit, and\nwithdraw multiple cryptocurrencies and fiat (currently only USD and CAD) without\nrequiring a bank. Spend also makes spending very easy through its different\nSpend Visa payment card options that automatically and instantly converts any\ncurrency enabled for card payments into the currency requested by the merchant.\nFurther down the line, it is also intended for Spend App to include many other\nservices, such as loans, interest, and even a full-blown merchant or marketplace\nintegration. The end goal for Spend is to keep all the financial activities of\nits users within the Spend App itself. Think of it as the ultimate banking\napplication.\n\nIn addition to connecting Particl and other businesses together, Bryan and his\nteam at Spend will actively explore, along with the Particl team, how both\nprojects can synergize together to push the adoption of distributed technologies\nand cryptocurrencies to a wider audience.\n\nOn one hand, Spend.com offers a full suite of gateway and payment services that\ncan help onboard people to the Particl platform much more effectively. These\nservices include the near-instant and cost-effective swap of currencies, fiat on\nand off-ramps, Visa payment cards, and etc.\n\nOn the other hand, the multiple decentralized services produced by the Particl\nteam can allow Spend’s ecosystem to blossom into a powerful application that\nseamlessly combines the traditional banking industry and distributed\ntechnologies, making the adoption of new users into alternative banking and\ncryptocurrencies much easier than ever.\n\nA Methodical & Strategic Approach to Increasing Particl’s Stability\nBy integrating Particl’s decentralized services into other businesses, an\nincreased number of transactions is expected to occur on the native Particl\nblockchain and on the markets, providing the entire network and its various\napplications (i.e. Particl’s decentralized marketplace) with more privacy,\nliquidity, and stability.\n\nIt is important to highlight that this new strategic relationship between Bryan\nWoods and the Particl team marks the official beginning of a long-term and very\nstrategic play to take the banking and eCommerce worlds through the next\nevolutionary hop. As a result, to ensure the trading markets can absorb the new\ninflux of activity caused by businesses integrating Particl services,\nintegrations will be deployed methodically, one by one, in a way that ensures\nmarket stability. Over time, each added integration will contribute to\nincreasing the overall liquidity of the markets, making it easier to deploy more\nintegrations and more services at a much faster pace.\n\nParticl’s First Few Steps Towards a Comprehensive SDK\nFor Particl, this phase also marks a very important milestone. These are the\nfirst few steps towards building and packaging a comprehensive developer SDK. \nThe process of building integrations for third-parties will give the team a\nbrand new perspective on what components are the most critical for developers\nlooking forward to using a Particl SDK and will considerably speed up the\nprocess of finalizing and releasing it. In a way, the team will have to go\nthrough some of the same steps developers will go through when using the SDK, so\nhighlighting needs and issues should be much quicker.\n\nSuch integrations will demonstrate that with a bit of creativity, blockchain\ntechnology and cryptocurrencies can offer very practical and disruptive\nsolutions to some of the most pressing issues present within the traditional\nbanking, payment, and eCommerce systems.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout Bryan Woods\n> Bryan has more than 18 years of experience in the technical and payment\nindustries.

As you probably already know, the team initiated its \nParticl World Tour [https://particl.news/particl-world-tour-2019-f6e3d3c7e09c] \nby first going to the United States and attend 3 different conferences —\nMoney2020 [https://us.money2020.com/], WCC [https://worldcryptocon.com/], and \nSFBW’s Epicenter [https://sfblockchainweek.io/].\n\nIt’s safe to say that, throughout this first part of the Particl World Tour, the\nteam has made tremendous progress on all fronts and has been able to collect a\nsignificant amount of feedback, advice, contacts, and most importantly, new\nfriends taking part, just like the team, in this ambitious blockchain journey!\nAlong the way, Particl met with tech evangelists, developers, capital funds,\nbusiness owners, market makers, innovators, and was even able to scoop a new\nadvisor [https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190348538498019329], Bryan\nWoods [https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-woods-3243a1167] (Spend.com\n[https://spend.com]’s President) to assist and support the project in making the\nbest out of the many opportunities currently opening up within the payment and\neCommerce industries. The team had the blessing of being accompanied, for most\nof the trip, by Crypto PR Lab, a San Francisco-based PR firm that has grown\ncloser to the team ever since meeting for the first time at Consensus 2019.\nTheir insight, reach, and contacts within the local SF blockchain community have\nproven to be an invaluable asset for the entire duration of the trip.\n\nFor this first part of the Particl World Tour, the team split into different\ngroups and spread out on the US West Coast (San Francisco & Las Vegas) to cover\nmultiple events and maximize results. This strategy allowed to cover a lot of\nground at once and has brought very valuable connections that could then be best\nleveraged by the fact that the whole team ended up meeting as one for SFBW’s\nEpicenter. It doesn’t happen all the time that so many team members get to meet,\nin-person, and so the strategy was to optimize this precious opportunity and get\nthe most done out of it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSan Francisco\nWhile a portion of the team was in Vegas for Money2020 and WCC, another portion\nwas already in San Francisco for the start of the San Francisco Blockchain Week.\nEpicenter, the week’s main and last event, is where Particl held a booth for two\ndays as well as a 30-minute talk. But in no way was it the only event of\ninterest!\n\nThe city was literally buzzing about blockchain and the many events attracted\nthe entirety of the local, but very front running, San Francisco-based\ncryptocurrency community. It really felt home! Let’s not forget San Francisco\nand the Bay Area, in general, is the homeland of startups and the heart of the\ntech industry. People from all around the world join together with the hopes of\ncreating the next new groundbreaking technology or project. Particl fits very\nmuch within that innovation-focused and very forward-thinking mindset.\n\nSFBW’s particular type of schedule (having the main event at the very end of the\nweek) proved to be an excellent opportunity for the team to initiate the first\npoints of contact with multiple key people by attending many of the side-events\nand evening receptions organized all throughout the week. Then, during the two\ndays of Epicenter, came the opportunities to capitalize on these contacts made\nduring the week by demonstrating the marketplace and have more quality time with\nthese people.\n\nBefore Epicenter, the Particl team attended CESC, the San Francisco Blockchain\nWeek’s kickoff event where it set up a table at the location to improvise a\nquick Particl booth with a couple of computers running the Open Marketplace. As\nis now usual, the marketplace really impressed and gained great reactions and\ninterest which brought new pairs of eyes on Particl and made new friends around,\nlike the stand-up guys over at Cracking Crypto\n[https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto],\n[https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto] for example.\n\nDr. Kap Giving an Interview to the Cracking Crypto ShowThe team also attended\nmore than a dozen side-events (most of the time, many a night…who needs sleep?)\nall throughout the week such as receptions organized by Polychain Capital,\nPantera Capital, Outliers Ventures, Starfish Network, eToro, Huobi, OceanEx, and\nmore. The connections established at all these events really did set the state\nfor when everybody would be crossing paths again later at Epicenter.\n\nLas Vegas\nAnd so while a portion of the team was in San Francisco for the start of SFBW,\nJoe Fisher and Cryptoguard were in Las Vegas, to attend Money2020\n[https://us.money2020.com/] and the World Crypto Conference (WCC)\n[https://worldcryptocon.com/].\n\nParticl Welcomes Bryan Woods, Spend.com’s President, as New AdvisorAt Money2020 [https://us.money2020.com/], a Fintech conference focused on\ninnovations within the payment industry, the focus was entirely on sealing the\ndeal with a new advisor, Bryan Woods, President at Spend.com. Spend.com is a\nteam that has been growing closer to the Particl team ever since meeting at the\nConsensus 2019 booth in New York City.\n\nThe Particl team spent 2 full days working at Spend.com’s booth (one of the big\nsponsors of Money2020) to discuss and work on various strategies moving into\n2020. This is a direct follow-up to another in-person trip the team made earlier\nin October 2019 to meet up with Spend.com. Meeting once again, at Money2020,\nallowed both teams to initiate and walk the first steps of a long-term\nrelationship together. More details will follow this coming Thursday in a blog\npost published on Particl.news. Definitely stay tuned!\n\nSpecial shoutout to Nicholas Merten [https://twitter.com/Nicholas_Merten], aka \nDataDash [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCatR7nWbYrkVXdxXb4cGXw], which the\nteam had the pleasure to cross paths with at Money2020. His focus, dedication,\nand projects to help cryptocurrencies move further along the path to mainstream\nadoption really impressed!\n\nNicholas Merten, aka Datadash, hanging out with ParticlThen, after Money2020,\nCryptoguard flew to join the rest of the team in San Francisco while Joe Fisher\nstayed an additional day in Vegas to take part in the WCC conference\n[https://worldcryptocon.com/].\n\nWCC was the perfect occasion to meet with some of the people the team had been\nlooking forward to meetup with again and yet another quality event to make the\nfirst points of contact with various people. Indeed, just like SFBW, WCC\nattracted a quality crowd as well as many leaders within the blockchain\nindustry, some of which couldn’t make it to SFBW. In that scenario, splitting\nthe team into two different cities really reaped a lot of benefits for Particl.\n\nJoe Fisher and Masha Prusakova at WCC 2019Epicenter — SFBW’s Main Event\nAnd then came Epicenter [https://sfblockchainweek.io/], the main event of the\nSan Francisco Blockchain Week. The Particl team all met as one the day before\nand came to the conference as a gold sponsor, had a booth right next to the main\nentrance, and gave a 30-minute talk on the Industry Stage.\n\nParticl Team Showing Off the Open Marketplace at SFBW’s EpicenterJust like\nthroughout the first part of the week, the reactions at the booth were\noverwhelmingly good and, maybe strangely enough, people still looked surprised\nthat a fully decentralized and no compromise blockchain project is already live\nand looking so good, even to this day. This is the typical feedback Particl has\nbeen receiving ever since it started going to more events this year.\n\nEpicenter’s crowd was definitely smaller than Consensus, but it was much more\nfocused and in “business mode”. The reason for this is actually important to\nunderstand. The people who still remain in blockchain after a more than\ntwo-year-long bear market and keep attending these kinds of events are the true\npioneers that will propel the next blockchain wave. They are the people fighting\nin the trenches, against all odds, to make sure the blockchain revolution will\none day catch up on the mainstream level.\n\nAnd in San Francisco, of all places, a place renowned for how many tech\ninnovations it generates every year. The people attending these conferences\ndon’t look at the industry with a narrow-minded view. No, they instead know the\nlong-term potential of these groundbreaking technologies and are the ones that\nare making it happen.\n\nThis is actually the main reason Particl wanted to attend SFBW. The team knew\nthe potential of this local blockchain community, thanks in part to attending\nthe SF-based Bitcoin2019\n[https://particl.news/particl-in-san-francisco-bitcoin2019-571fe31fe396] \nconference earlier in the year, and knew it would be a perfectly receptive and\nexcited crowd.\n\n, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman at Blockchain Research InstituteAnd the team\nwas right! Particl had the opportunity to spend some high-quality time with\nthought leaders and experts from many different industries and received many\nadvice and resources. For example, the Particl team had the chance to meet with \nDon Tapscott, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman at Blockchain Research Institute\n[https://www.blockchainresearchinstitute.org/], and earn 30 minutes of his time\njust before flying out to Europe.\n\nIndeed, just like with Don Tapscott, many similar breakout meetings, sit-downs,\nand evening-long discussions happened with several key people working on pushing\nblockchain forward. The team met with media, capital firms, lawyers, developers,\nbusiness developers, the inventor of eGift cards, and even a guy that can solve\na Rubics cube blindfolded, but more importantly, made many new friends on the\nway that are as passionate and dedicated to see cryptocurrencies succeed.\n\nThe team also had a 30-minute speaking slot on the Industry Stage and sent Dr.\nKap on stage. Some of the people the team has met throughout the week attended\nthe talk which further helped them understand the project’s vision and\nintentions. The official presentation video will be published within a few days\nby the SFBW organizers. In the meantime, you can check out Dr. Kap’s\npresentation on Particl’s Youtube channel.\n\n> The upload originally is a Periscope\n[https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB] \n[https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB]video\n[https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB] taken by Particl’s Community\nManager, Guillaume Benayoun. You can check out more video of the team in San\nFrancisco by browsing Ben’s Periscope uploads here: \nhttps://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1jMJgwZoNjWJL?t=1s\nThe team used the exposure and momentum provided by a full week of intensive\nnetworking to announce to major pieces of news that will help propel the project\nforward —an in-wallet integration of a Bitcoin exchange module\n[https://particl.news/particl-announces-bitcoin-exchange-integration-into-particl-desktop-e7c0940c0b4d] \nand the official beginning of an intimate and long-term relationship with\nSpend.com [https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190348538498019329]. Bryan\nWoods, Spend.com’s President, was announced at the same time as a new advisor to\nthe project.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTakeaways\nThink of this whole US West Coast trip as a giant, never-ending brainstorming\nsession with not only team members, but advisors, leaders, and experts from many\ndifferent industries hungry to see any solid blockchain tech succeed.\n\nThe Particl Team Debriefing Post-SFBWThe people the team met get it. They get\nthe potential of blockchain and Particl both. They want to see the industry\nsucceed and the products powered by blockchain land in the hands of everyday\npeople.\n\nWhile the team already knew about the quality of the Particl platform, it is now\ncrystal clear from all the feedback received that the Particl ecosystem and its\nOpen Marketplace is very advanced in terms of tech compared to almost any other\nend-user-focused blockchain product. The vision, mission, and disruptive\npotential of such a platform is also a shared feeling within all of the people\nmet during this trip.\n\nBut getting this product into people’s hands is equally important, if not more. \nThe best product in the world serves no purpose if it is not being used by\nanyone. This trip provided the team with a lot of resources, connections, and\noffers that will help Particl jump in with two feet into this new\nadoption-focused phase the project is headed to.\n\nThe team has been able to discuss, in detail and with valuable outside\nperspectives, the next steps moving into 2020. What’s coming next in 2020 will\nbe very methodical and carefully planned, and it’s all about getting that\nadoption going. Thanks to this US West Coast trip, the team is now equipped with\nthe best resources it could have hoped for at the best time imaginable. Let’s do\nthis! ?\n\nWhat’s Next?\nThe development team has been focused on the next few items, as identified a\nwhile ago\n[https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b]\n, required before aggressive adoption strategies can start getting a worthy\nconversion rate. Indeed, the Open Marketplace and Particl Desktop still lack a\nfew features the team would like to have before actively trying to drive users\nto the marketplace.\n\nIn the meantime, the communications and strategy team is now embarking in a new\nphase to start the onboarding of users as soon as the platform is ready for\nadoption. The team will be taking part in various internal workshops in Berlin\nin the coming weeks along with key connections and advisors made throughout the\npast two weeks. That’s to craft strategies related to the user adoption of the\nOpen Marketplace and the Particl network in general and help the project pivot\ntowards a a more “business” focused phase in the most efficient manner possible.\n\nIt is very clear, the team is coming back from this US West Coast trip extremely\nmotivated and hungry for success. A lot of doors are opening up, on all fronts,\ndirectly to Particl and also to the blockchain industry itself. The world is\nreceptive to the idea of blockchain technology but cautious due to this\nnow-very-long bear market. It is why the next steps of the way need to be very\nmethodological to seize the most of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\n\nParticl Team After Epicenter’s ClosureAs you might start to understand simply by\nreading this post, this trip marks the beginning of brand new objectives,\nchallenges, and goals for the project. Think of it as the “war room phase”, the\nmoment where strategies are made and carefully, methodically set in motion.\n\nNext Locations of the Particl World Tour\nWith that in mind, the team is going to be attending, in a smaller capacity, two\nadditional events and then conclude it’s already very worthy Particl World Tour.\n\nIndeed, you’ll be able to find Particl at Blockshow Asia\n[https://blockshow.com/], in Singapore, and Slush Helsinki\n[https://www.slush.org/events/helsinki/], in Finland.\n\nAt Blockshow Asia, the same boots-on-the-grounds approach as used during SFBW’s\nside-events and WCC will be applied. It will be all about establishing the first\npoints of contact and reconvening with key people within the Asian market to get\nas much insight as possible. Don’t forget, as mentioned in a previous blog post\n[https://particl.news/particl-in-singapore-consensus-asia-a3be041d315e] on\nParticl.news, Singapore is a place of interest for Particl because of new tax\nregulations being proposed which would make any sale paid for with\ncryptocurrencies a tax-free event. It is a direct use-case for buying and\nselling using cryptocurrencies and a great opportunity for Particl to shine\nbrightly. This is, quite simply, crypto having a clear shot at going mainstream\nin Singapore…\n\nAt Slush Helsinki, a tech startup/founder focused conference, the team will be\noperating a booth and meeting up with various advisors and mentors specifically\ngoing to the event to help out motivated, young entrepreneurs. The team will\nconsist of Juha Kovanen (Marketplace Lead Developer), Gerlof van Ek (Lead\nDesigner, Developer), Dr. Kapil Amarasinghe (UK Particl Ambassador), and Gloria\n(Particl’s Communications & Strategy Team).\n\nBoth these events will allow Particl to receive even more feedback, advice, and\nresources as it jumps right into its next phase. The timing of it all couldn’t\nbe better!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou, Too, Can Be a Part of it!\nThe best connections happen face-to-face, this is simply how things happen in\nthe space. The people you meet, in-person, by going to conferences and their\nrelated side-events are not the same crypto people you meet online. These are\nthe active and focused people working day and night on the blockchain\nrevolution. They are the ones that make it all happen!\n\nFor this reason, the Particl team very strongly encourages you to go out there\nand attend your local blockchain events. Crypto is not dead, it’s alive and\nkicking in a way that might surprise you! The bear market is making innovators\nmore motivated and hungry for success, a feeling that is not always shared by\nthe “online crypto community”. Go out there, meet people face-to-face, and be\nright in the middle of the biggest revolution of our times (with no hyperbole\nadded here ?).\n\nAfter all, meeting other crypto fans and innovators to change the world is just\none part of why you should attend these events. The other part is…well, it is so\nmuch FUN! Dare try it just once and you’ll be hooked!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStay tuned for more news about Spend.com’s relationship with Particl this coming\nThursday, the 14th of November. Then, on the 21st of November, Particl will be\nhaving another surprise announcement!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-fg-rxBVAgcC3I7WZpZR3dA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"recap-dr-kap-s-own-video-recap-of-the-events-\">Recap + Dr. Kap’s Own Video Recap of the Events ?</h3><p>The Particl team is finally back home from its US West Coast trip and hot damn was it an eventful week! As you probably already know, the team initiated its <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-world-tour-2019-f6e3d3c7e09c\"><strong>Particl World Tour</strong></a> by first going to the United States and attend 3 different conferences —<a href=\"https://us.money2020.com/\"><strong> Money2020</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://worldcryptocon.com/\"><strong>WCC</strong></a>, and<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://sfblockchainweek.io/\"><strong>SFBW’s Epicenter</strong></a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fB1yf5CaXHI\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>It’s safe to say that, throughout this first part of the Particl World Tour, the team has made tremendous progress on all fronts and has been able to collect a significant amount of feedback, advice, contacts, and most importantly, new friends taking part, just like the team, in this ambitious blockchain journey! Along the way, Particl met with tech evangelists, developers, capital funds, business owners, market makers, innovators, and was even able to scoop a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190348538498019329\"><strong>new advisor</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-woods-3243a1167\"><strong>Bryan Woods</strong></a> (<a href=\"https://spend.com\"><strong>Spend.com</strong></a>’s President) to assist and support the project in making the best out of the many opportunities currently opening up within the payment and eCommerce industries. <strong>The team had the blessing of being accompanied, for most of the trip, by Crypto PR Lab, a San Francisco-based PR firm</strong> that has grown closer to the team ever since meeting for the first time at Consensus 2019. Their insight, reach, and contacts within the local SF blockchain community have proven to be an invaluable asset for the entire duration of the trip.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JXnJg_HTXI8?feature=oembed\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>For this first part of the Particl World Tour, <strong>the team split into different groups and spread out on the US West Coast</strong> (San Francisco &amp; Las Vegas) to cover multiple events and maximize results. This strategy allowed to cover a lot of ground at once and has brought very valuable connections that could then be best leveraged by the fact that the whole team ended up meeting as one for SFBW’s Epicenter. It doesn’t happen all the time that so many team members get to meet, in-person, and so the strategy was to optimize this precious opportunity and get the most done out of it.</p><hr><h2 id=\"san-francisco\">San Francisco</h2><p>While a portion of the team was in Vegas for Money2020 and WCC, another portion was already in San Francisco for the start of the San Francisco Blockchain Week. Epicenter, the week’s main and last event, is where Particl held a booth for two days as well as a 30-minute talk. But in no way was it the only event of interest!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-AQI1srPnv0aVadXpHrS-YQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>The city was literally buzzing about blockchain and the many events attracted the entirety of the local, but very front running, San Francisco-based cryptocurrency community. It really felt home! Let’s not forget San Francisco and the Bay Area, in general, is the homeland of startups and the heart of the tech industry. People from all around the world join together with the hopes of creating the next new groundbreaking technology or project. Particl fits very much within that innovation-focused and very forward-thinking mindset.</p><p>SFBW’s particular type of schedule (having the main event at the very end of the week) proved to be an excellent opportunity for the team to initiate the first points of contact with multiple key people by attending many of the side-events and evening receptions organized all throughout the week. Then, during the two days of Epicenter, came the opportunities to capitalize on these contacts made during the week by demonstrating the marketplace and have more quality time with these people.</p><p>Before Epicenter, the Particl team attended CESC, the San Francisco Blockchain Week’s kickoff event where it set up a table at the location to improvise a quick Particl booth with a couple of computers running the Open Marketplace. As is now usual, the marketplace really impressed and gained great reactions and interest which brought new pairs of eyes on Particl and made new friends around, like the stand-up guys over at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto\"><strong>Cracking Crypto</strong></a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto\">,</a> for example.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-1s_bWqb9sJ0nOJzAx_jmyA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Dr. Kap Giving an Interview to the Cracking Crypto Show</figcaption></figure><p>The team also attended more than a dozen side-events (most of the time, many a night…who needs sleep?) all throughout the week such as receptions organized by Polychain Capital, Pantera Capital, Outliers Ventures, Starfish Network, eToro, Huobi, OceanEx, and more. The connections established at all these events really did set the state for when everybody would be crossing paths again later at Epicenter.</p><h2 id=\"las-vegas\">Las Vegas</h2><p>And so while a portion of the team was in San Francisco for the start of SFBW, Joe Fisher and Cryptoguard were in Las Vegas, to attend <a href=\"https://us.money2020.com/\"><strong>Money2020</strong></a> and the <a href=\"https://worldcryptocon.com/\"><strong>World Crypto Conference (WCC)</strong></a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-0D0gVZM4ldY_H1DLZBPlyw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl Welcomes Bryan Woods, Spend.com’s President, as New Advisor</figcaption></figure><p>At <a href=\"https://us.money2020.com/\">Money2020</a>, a Fintech conference focused on innovations within the payment industry, the focus was entirely on <strong>sealing the deal with a new advisor, Bryan Woods, President at Spend.com.</strong> Spend.com is a team that has been growing closer to the Particl team ever since meeting at the Consensus 2019 booth in New York City.</p><p><strong>The Particl team spent 2 full days working at Spend.com’s booth</strong> (one of the big sponsors of Money2020) to discuss and work on various strategies moving into 2020. <strong>This is a direct follow-up to another in-person trip the team made earlier in October 2019 to meet up with Spend.com.</strong> Meeting once again, at Money2020, allowed both teams to initiate and walk the first steps of a long-term relationship together. More details will follow this coming Thursday in a blog post published on Particl.news. Definitely stay tuned!</p><p>Special shoutout to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nicholas_Merten\"><strong>Nicholas Merten</strong></a>, aka <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCatR7nWbYrkVXdxXb4cGXw\"><strong>DataDash</strong></a>, which the team had the pleasure to cross paths with at Money2020. His focus, dedication, and projects to help cryptocurrencies move further along the path to mainstream adoption really impressed!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-nQDXMaDJpFACqsgG28IwAw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Nicholas Merten, aka Datadash, hanging out with Particl</figcaption></figure><p>Then, after Money2020, Cryptoguard flew to join the rest of the team in San Francisco while Joe Fisher stayed an additional day in Vegas to take part in the <a href=\"https://worldcryptocon.com/\">WCC conference</a>.</p><p>WCC was the perfect occasion to meet with some of the people the team had been looking forward to meetup with again and yet another quality event to make the first points of contact with various people. Indeed, just like SFBW, WCC attracted a quality crowd as well as many leaders within the blockchain industry, some of which couldn’t make it to SFBW. In that scenario, splitting the team into two different cities really reaped a lot of benefits for Particl.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-oOCQxSc4XZuiiGtoCW04Iw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Joe Fisher and Masha Prusakova at WCC 2019</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"epicenter-sfbw-s-main-event\">Epicenter — SFBW’s Main Event</h2><p>And then came <a href=\"https://sfblockchainweek.io/\"><strong>Epicenter</strong></a>, the main event of the San Francisco Blockchain Week. The Particl team all met as one the day before and came to the conference as a gold sponsor, had a booth right next to the main entrance, and gave a 30-minute talk on the Industry Stage.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-sh0iU5S6N1qmWjpI_stjWw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl Team Showing Off the Open Marketplace at SFBW’s Epicenter</figcaption></figure><p>Just like throughout the first part of the week, the reactions at the booth were overwhelmingly good and, maybe strangely enough, people still looked surprised that a fully decentralized and no compromise blockchain project is already live and looking so good, even to this day. This is the typical feedback Particl has been receiving ever since it started going to more events this year.</p><p>Epicenter’s crowd was definitely smaller than Consensus, but it was much more focused and in “business mode”. The reason for this is actually important to understand. <strong>The people who still remain in blockchain after a more than two-year-long bear market and keep attending these kinds of events are the true pioneers that will propel the next blockchain wave.</strong> They are the people fighting in the trenches, against all odds, to make sure the blockchain revolution will one day catch up on the mainstream level.</p><p>And in San Francisco, of all places, a place renowned for how many tech innovations it generates every year. The people attending these conferences don’t look at the industry with a narrow-minded view. No, they instead know the long-term potential of these groundbreaking technologies and are the ones that are making it happen.</p><p>This is actually the main reason Particl wanted to attend SFBW. The team knew the potential of this local blockchain community, <strong>thanks in part to attending the SF-based </strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-in-san-francisco-bitcoin2019-571fe31fe396\"><strong>Bitcoin2019</strong></a><strong> conference earlier in the year</strong>, and knew it would be a perfectly receptive and excited crowd.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-y1kyfpZ9pREc31ZUZG5RuA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman at Blockchain Research Institute</figcaption></figure><p>And the team was right! Particl had the opportunity to spend some high-quality time with thought leaders and experts from many different industries and received many advice and resources. For example, the Particl team had the chance to meet with <strong>Don Tapscott, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman at </strong><a href=\"https://www.blockchainresearchinstitute.org/\"><strong>Blockchain Research Institute</strong></a>, and earn 30 minutes of his time just before flying out to Europe.</p><p>Indeed, just like with Don Tapscott, many similar breakout meetings, sit-downs, and evening-long discussions happened with several key people working on pushing blockchain forward. The team met with media, capital firms, lawyers, developers, business developers, the inventor of eGift cards, and even a guy that can solve a Rubics cube blindfolded, but more importantly, made many new friends on the way that are as passionate and dedicated to see cryptocurrencies succeed.</p><p>The team also had a 30-minute speaking slot on the Industry Stage and sent Dr. Kap on stage. Some of the people the team has met throughout the week attended the talk which further helped them understand the project’s vision and intentions. The official presentation video will be published within a few days by the SFBW organizers.

As you probably already know, the team initiated its <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-world-tour-2019-f6e3d3c7e09c\"><strong>Particl World Tour</strong></a> by first going to the United States and attend 3 different conferences —<a href=\"https://us.money2020.com/\"><strong> Money2020</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://worldcryptocon.com/\"><strong>WCC</strong></a>, and<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://sfblockchainweek.io/\"><strong>SFBW’s Epicenter</strong></a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fB1yf5CaXHI\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>It’s safe to say that, throughout this first part of the Particl World Tour, the team has made tremendous progress on all fronts and has been able to collect a significant amount of feedback, advice, contacts, and most importantly, new friends taking part, just like the team, in this ambitious blockchain journey! Along the way, Particl met with tech evangelists, developers, capital funds, business owners, market makers, innovators, and was even able to scoop a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190348538498019329\"><strong>new advisor</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-woods-3243a1167\"><strong>Bryan Woods</strong></a> (<a href=\"https://spend.com\"><strong>Spend.com</strong></a>’s President) to assist and support the project in making the best out of the many opportunities currently opening up within the payment and eCommerce industries. <strong>The team had the blessing of being accompanied, for most of the trip, by Crypto PR Lab, a San Francisco-based PR firm</strong> that has grown closer to the team ever since meeting for the first time at Consensus 2019. Their insight, reach, and contacts within the local SF blockchain community have proven to be an invaluable asset for the entire duration of the trip.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JXnJg_HTXI8?feature=oembed\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>For this first part of the Particl World Tour, <strong>the team split into different groups and spread out on the US West Coast</strong> (San Francisco &#x26; Las Vegas) to cover multiple events and maximize results. This strategy allowed to cover a lot of ground at once and has brought very valuable connections that could then be best leveraged by the fact that the whole team ended up meeting as one for SFBW’s Epicenter. It doesn’t happen all the time that so many team members get to meet, in-person, and so the strategy was to optimize this precious opportunity and get the most done out of it.</p><hr><h2 id=\"san-francisco\">San Francisco</h2><p>While a portion of the team was in Vegas for Money2020 and WCC, another portion was already in San Francisco for the start of the San Francisco Blockchain Week. Epicenter, the week’s main and last event, is where Particl held a booth for two days as well as a 30-minute talk. But in no way was it the only event of interest!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-AQI1srPnv0aVadXpHrS-YQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>The city was literally buzzing about blockchain and the many events attracted the entirety of the local, but very front running, San Francisco-based cryptocurrency community. It really felt home! Let’s not forget San Francisco and the Bay Area, in general, is the homeland of startups and the heart of the tech industry. People from all around the world join together with the hopes of creating the next new groundbreaking technology or project. Particl fits very much within that innovation-focused and very forward-thinking mindset.</p><p>SFBW’s particular type of schedule (having the main event at the very end of the week) proved to be an excellent opportunity for the team to initiate the first points of contact with multiple key people by attending many of the side-events and evening receptions organized all throughout the week. Then, during the two days of Epicenter, came the opportunities to capitalize on these contacts made during the week by demonstrating the marketplace and have more quality time with these people.</p><p>Before Epicenter, the Particl team attended CESC, the San Francisco Blockchain Week’s kickoff event where it set up a table at the location to improvise a quick Particl booth with a couple of computers running the Open Marketplace. As is now usual, the marketplace really impressed and gained great reactions and interest which brought new pairs of eyes on Particl and made new friends around, like the stand-up guys over at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto\"><strong>Cracking Crypto</strong></a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/CrackingCrypto\">,</a> for example.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-1s_bWqb9sJ0nOJzAx_jmyA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Dr. Kap Giving an Interview to the Cracking Crypto Show</figcaption></figure><p>The team also attended more than a dozen side-events (most of the time, many a night…who needs sleep?) all throughout the week such as receptions organized by Polychain Capital, Pantera Capital, Outliers Ventures, Starfish Network, eToro, Huobi, OceanEx, and more. The connections established at all these events really did set the state for when everybody would be crossing paths again later at Epicenter.</p><h2 id=\"las-vegas\">Las Vegas</h2><p>And so while a portion of the team was in San Francisco for the start of SFBW, Joe Fisher and Cryptoguard were in Las Vegas, to attend <a href=\"https://us.money2020.com/\"><strong>Money2020</strong></a> and the <a href=\"https://worldcryptocon.com/\"><strong>World Crypto Conference (WCC)</strong></a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-0D0gVZM4ldY_H1DLZBPlyw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl Welcomes Bryan Woods, Spend.com’s President, as New Advisor</figcaption></figure><p>At <a href=\"https://us.money2020.com/\">Money2020</a>, a Fintech conference focused on innovations within the payment industry, the focus was entirely on <strong>sealing the deal with a new advisor, Bryan Woods, President at Spend.com.</strong> Spend.com is a team that has been growing closer to the Particl team ever since meeting at the Consensus 2019 booth in New York City.</p><p><strong>The Particl team spent 2 full days working at Spend.com’s booth</strong> (one of the big sponsors of Money2020) to discuss and work on various strategies moving into 2020. <strong>This is a direct follow-up to another in-person trip the team made earlier in October 2019 to meet up with Spend.com.</strong> Meeting once again, at Money2020, allowed both teams to initiate and walk the first steps of a long-term relationship together. More details will follow this coming Thursday in a blog post published on Particl.news. Definitely stay tuned!</p><p>Special shoutout to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nicholas_Merten\"><strong>Nicholas Merten</strong></a>, aka <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCatR7nWbYrkVXdxXb4cGXw\"><strong>DataDash</strong></a>, which the team had the pleasure to cross paths with at Money2020. His focus, dedication, and projects to help cryptocurrencies move further along the path to mainstream adoption really impressed!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-nQDXMaDJpFACqsgG28IwAw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Nicholas Merten, aka Datadash, hanging out with Particl</figcaption></figure><p>Then, after Money2020, Cryptoguard flew to join the rest of the team in San Francisco while Joe Fisher stayed an additional day in Vegas to take part in the <a href=\"https://worldcryptocon.com/\">WCC conference</a>.</p><p>WCC was the perfect occasion to meet with some of the people the team had been looking forward to meetup with again and yet another quality event to make the first points of contact with various people. Indeed, just like SFBW, WCC attracted a quality crowd as well as many leaders within the blockchain industry, some of which couldn’t make it to SFBW. In that scenario, splitting the team into two different cities really reaped a lot of benefits for Particl.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-oOCQxSc4XZuiiGtoCW04Iw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Joe Fisher and Masha Prusakova at WCC 2019</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"epicenter-sfbw-s-main-event\">Epicenter — SFBW’s Main Event</h2><p>And then came <a href=\"https://sfblockchainweek.io/\"><strong>Epicenter</strong></a>, the main event of the San Francisco Blockchain Week. The Particl team all met as one the day before and came to the conference as a gold sponsor, had a booth right next to the main entrance, and gave a 30-minute talk on the Industry Stage.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-sh0iU5S6N1qmWjpI_stjWw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl Team Showing Off the Open Marketplace at SFBW’s Epicenter</figcaption></figure><p>Just like throughout the first part of the week, the reactions at the booth were overwhelmingly good and, maybe strangely enough, people still looked surprised that a fully decentralized and no compromise blockchain project is already live and looking so good, even to this day. This is the typical feedback Particl has been receiving ever since it started going to more events this year.</p><p>Epicenter’s crowd was definitely smaller than Consensus, but it was much more focused and in “business mode”. The reason for this is actually important to understand. <strong>The people who still remain in blockchain after a more than two-year-long bear market and keep attending these kinds of events are the true pioneers that will propel the next blockchain wave.</strong> They are the people fighting in the trenches, against all odds, to make sure the blockchain revolution will one day catch up on the mainstream level.</p><p>And in San Francisco, of all places, a place renowned for how many tech innovations it generates every year. The people attending these conferences don’t look at the industry with a narrow-minded view. No, they instead know the long-term potential of these groundbreaking technologies and are the ones that are making it happen.</p><p>This is actually the main reason Particl wanted to attend SFBW. The team knew the potential of this local blockchain community, <strong>thanks in part to attending the SF-based </strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-in-san-francisco-bitcoin2019-571fe31fe396\"><strong>Bitcoin2019</strong></a><strong> conference earlier in the year</strong>, and knew it would be a perfectly receptive and excited crowd.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-y1kyfpZ9pREc31ZUZG5RuA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman at Blockchain Research Institute</figcaption></figure><p>And the team was right! Particl had the opportunity to spend some high-quality time with thought leaders and experts from many different industries and received many advice and resources. For example, the Particl team had the chance to meet with <strong>Don Tapscott, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman at </strong><a href=\"https://www.blockchainresearchinstitute.org/\"><strong>Blockchain Research Institute</strong></a>, and earn 30 minutes of his time just before flying out to Europe.</p><p>Indeed, just like with Don Tapscott, many similar breakout meetings, sit-downs, and evening-long discussions happened with several key people working on pushing blockchain forward. The team met with media, capital firms, lawyers, developers, business developers, the inventor of eGift cards, and even a guy that can solve a Rubics cube blindfolded, but more importantly, made many new friends on the way that are as passionate and dedicated to see cryptocurrencies succeed.</p><p>The team also had a 30-minute speaking slot on the Industry Stage and sent Dr. Kap on stage. Some of the people the team has met throughout the week attended the talk which further helped them understand the project’s vision and intentions. The official presentation video will be published within a few days by the SFBW organizers. In the meantime, you can check out Dr. Kap’s presentation on Particl’s Youtube channel.</p><blockquote>The upload originally is a <a href=\"https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB\"><strong>Periscope</strong></a><a href=\"https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.pscp.tv/PART_BEN/1vOxwaggAXWGB\"><strong>video</strong></a><strong> </strong>taken by Particl’s Community Manager, Guillaume Benayoun.

They get the potential of blockchain and Particl both. <strong>They want to see the industry succeed and the products powered by blockchain land in the hands of everyday people.</strong></p><p>While the team already knew about the quality of the Particl platform, it is now crystal clear from all the feedback received that the Particl ecosystem and its Open Marketplace is very advanced in terms of tech compared to almost any other end-user-focused blockchain product. The vision, mission, and disruptive potential of such a platform is also a shared feeling within all of the people met during this trip.</p><p><strong>But getting this product into people’s hands is equally important, if not more.</strong> The best product in the world serves no purpose if it is not being used by anyone. This trip provided the team with a lot of resources, connections, and offers that will help Particl jump in with two feet into this new adoption-focused phase the project is headed to.</p><p>The team has been able to discuss, in detail and with valuable outside perspectives, the next steps moving into 2020. What’s coming next in 2020 will be very methodical and carefully planned, and it’s all about getting that adoption going. Thanks to this US West Coast trip, the team is now equipped with the best resources it could have hoped for at the best time imaginable. Let’s do this! ?</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s Next?</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-SB2ytltBLugFKL1rJVhF_Q.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>The development team has been focused on the next few items, <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-open-marketplace-and-the-road-to-mainstream-adoption-870ced49677b\">as identified a while ago</a>, required before aggressive adoption strategies can start getting a worthy conversion rate. Indeed, the Open Marketplace and Particl Desktop still lack a few features the team would like to have before actively trying to drive users to the marketplace.</p><p>In the meantime, <strong>the communications and strategy team is now embarking in a new phase</strong> to start the onboarding of users as soon as the platform is ready for adoption. The team will be taking part in various internal workshops in Berlin in the coming weeks along with key connections and advisors made throughout the past two weeks. That’s to craft strategies related to the user adoption of the Open Marketplace and the Particl network in general and help the project pivot towards a a more “business” focused phase in the most efficient manner possible.</p><p>It is very clear, <strong>the team is coming back from this US West Coast trip extremely motivated and hungry for success</strong>. A lot of doors are opening up, on all fronts, directly to Particl and also to the blockchain industry itself. The world is receptive to the idea of blockchain technology but cautious due to this now-very-long bear market. It is why the next steps of the way need to be very methodological to seize the most of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-Gbg9aHfYJ9bhiThjAvvKwQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl Team After Epicenter’s Closure</figcaption></figure><p>As you might start to understand simply by reading this post, <strong>this trip marks the beginning of brand new objectives, challenges, and goals for the project.</strong> Think of it as the “war room phase”, the moment where strategies are made and carefully, methodically set in motion.</p><h3 id=\"next-locations-of-the-particl-world-tour\">Next Locations of the Particl World Tour</h3><p>With that in mind, the team is going to be attending, in a smaller capacity, two additional events and then conclude it’s already very worthy Particl World Tour.</p><p>Indeed, you’ll be able to find Particl at <a href=\"https://blockshow.com/\"><strong>Blockshow Asia</strong></a>, in Singapore, and <a href=\"https://www.slush.org/events/helsinki/\"><strong>Slush Helsinki</strong></a>, in Finland.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Travels-to-the-US-West-Coast/1-cWDe1_sIGidEmR1cFeidDw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>At Blockshow Asia, the same boots-on-the-grounds approach as used during SFBW’s side-events and WCC will be applied. It will be all about establishing the first points of contact and reconvening with key people within the Asian market to get as much insight as possible. Don’t forget, as mentioned in a <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-in-singapore-consensus-asia-a3be041d315e\"><strong>previous blog post</strong></a> on Particl.news, <strong>Singapore is a place of interest for Particl because of new tax regulations being proposed which would make any sale paid for with cryptocurrencies a tax-free event.</strong> It is a direct use-case for buying and selling using cryptocurrencies and a great opportunity for Particl to shine brightly. This is, quite simply, crypto having a clear shot at going mainstream in Singapore…</p><p>At Slush Helsinki, a tech startup/founder focused conference, the team will be operating a booth and meeting up with various advisors and mentors specifically going to the event to help out motivated, young entrepreneurs. The team will consist of Juha Kovanen (Marketplace Lead Developer), Gerlof van Ek (Lead Designer, Developer), Dr. Kapil Amarasinghe (UK Particl Ambassador), and Gloria (Particl’s Communications &#x26; Strategy Team).</p><p>Both these events will allow Particl to receive even more feedback, advice, and resources as it jumps right into its next phase. The timing of it all couldn’t be better!</p><hr><h2 id=\"you-too-can-be-a-part-of-it-\">You, Too, Can Be a Part of it!</h2><p>The best connections happen face-to-face, this is simply how things happen in the space. The people you meet, in-person, by going to conferences and their related side-events are not the same crypto people you meet online. These are the active and focused people working day and night on the blockchain revolution. They are the ones that make it all happen!</p><p><strong>For this reason, the Particl team very strongly encourages you to go out there and attend your local blockchain events.</strong> Crypto is not dead, it’s alive and kicking in a way that might surprise you! The bear market is making innovators more motivated and hungry for success, a feeling that is not always shared by the “online crypto community”. Go out there, meet people face-to-face, and be right in the middle of the biggest revolution of our times (with no hyperbole added here ?).</p><p>After all, meeting other crypto fans and innovators to change the world is just one part of why you should attend these events. The other part is…well, it is so much FUN! Dare try it just once and you’ll be hooked!</p><hr><p>Stay tuned for <strong>more news about Spend.com’s relationship with Particl this coming Thursday, the 14th of November</strong>.

Initially mentioned\n[https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1190359593550901248] last Friday by\nDr. Kapil Amarasinghe during his 30-minute talk at SFBW’s Epicenter\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZAmMXEvkPc], this new payment option will\nallow users to easily use Bitcoin as a form of payment on the Open Marketplace.\nThis news is directly in line with Particl’s current focus on adoption (in this\nparticular case, focused on the cryptocurrency crowd) and makes the Open\nMarketplace more accessible than ever, especially to people not currently part\nof the Particl community.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBitcoin Payment Integration\nHow the integration of this new feature will look like is as a separate,\nstandalone BTC-PART exchange module within Particl Desktop. The module will\ninteract with the checkout process but will not be directly integrated as part\nof the full buy flow. It will instead be displayed as a separate page within\nParticl Desktop.\n\nThe reason for this is simple — once BTC is transferred for PART, the received\nPART is always, at least initially, received on a public balance. As you\nprobably already know, the Open Marketplace funds stored on anon balances to be\nable to purchase products and services. And because converting funds from a\npublic balance to an anon one takes 12 confirmations, on top of which more\nconfirmations are added as a result of the exchange’s own confirmations\n(incoming Bitcoin confirmations, for example), the integration, as it currently\nstands, cannot be integrated as a core component of the buy flow in a\nuser-friendly and practical way.\n\nExchange Module…as a Separate Page\nWIP, Interface Subject to Change (Testnet Only Shows PART to PART Exchange, BTC\non Mainnet Only)How the integration of this BTC-PART module will look like is a\nsimple and convenient Exchange accessible right from the left sidebar of Particl\nDesktop! If you recall, on Particl Desktop, the Wallet section of the menu\ncurrently has these four pages: Send/Convert, Receive, History, and Address\nBook. This update will introduce fifth section, Exchange, to the Wallet section\nof the sidebar. This page will also be accessible from any regular wallet,\nmeaning the exchange feature won’t need to be manually activated by the user.\n\nPutting the Exchange page as a standalone page on any type of wallet means\nBitcoin users will be able to fund their wallets with PART using Bitcoin,\nallowing them to use any of the Particl Desktop features that requires a fee to\nbe paid (privacy transaction, community proposals, flagging items, etc).\n\nExchange Module…as Part of the Checkout Process\nWhile the exchange module will be a standalone application, at least for the\nforeseeable future, it will still be integrated into the checkout process and\ninteract with it. The process is simple — simply go through the same process of\npurchasing an item to your cart as you always do. Add an item to your cart,\nconfirm the cart’s content, enter your shipping information, and then land on\nthe order confirmation page. Right at that moment, you will be met with two\nbuttons — one to confirm your order, and the other to be redirected to the\nexchange module. If you do not have enough funds to place your order, then the\n“Confirm Order” button will be greyed out while the Exchange button will\nredirect you to the exchange module.\n\nOnce there, the module will automatically fill up the number of PART necessary\nto pay for your order and tell you exactly how many BTC are required to acquire\nthat many PART coins. You will then be able to send Bitcoin to the exchange\nmodule and receive PART in exchange. Once the exchange is completed, you’ll be\nable to easily come back to the confirmation section of the checkout process and\nsuccessfully place your order.\n\nSo while Bitcoin won’t directly be a “payment option” per se, the exchange\nmodule will still interact with your cart in a way that makes it easier and\nuser-friendly for everyone to get the right amount of PART using BTC.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThis BTC-PART exchange module will not be using atomic swaps of any sort of\ndecentralized exchange method, at least not for its initial integration.\nInstead, it will be plugged into a non-custodial exchange that doesn’t require\nKYC or personal information —SimpleSwap [https://simpleswap.io/].\n\nWIP, Interface Subject to Change (Testnet Only Shows PART to PART Exchange, BTC\non Mainnet Only)The module uses SMSG to relay messages between Particl and the\nSimpleSwap engine. The key part to understand is that this exchange module has\nbeen built using SMSG in a very generic matter, and it could eventually be used\nas the base layers to deploy all sorts of services on Particl (i.e. price\npegging, chat module, etc). This module is likely to be included in the incoming\nParticl SDK which is probably going to see the day somewhere in 2020.\n\nA “per transaction” limit function has also been integrated into the module as\nwell, making sure users exchange a number of coins that’s in between the minimum\nand maximum range allowed by the exchange. Most of the information that is\nusually displayed when making a transaction on [https://simpleswap.io/]\nSimpleSwap [https://simpleswap.io/] will also all be displayed right from\nParticl Desktop.\n\nAdditionally, the exchange module will also include an “auto-anonymizer” feature\nwhich will allow you to automatically receive your PART on anon balances. This\nadditional privacy feature included in Particl Desktop’s exchange module isn’t\navailable when simply going on [https://simpleswap.io/]SimpleSwap\n[https://simpleswap.io/]’s website. That RingCT exchange perk feature may, or\nmay not, be part of the first iteration of the exchange module, but it is\nalready in development and should follow very shortly after the first release if\nnot immediately ready. Fingers crossed!\n\nFinally, the exchange module is not designed or hardcoded to work only using \n[https://simpleswap.io/]SimpleSwap [https://simpleswap.io/]. That particualr\nexchange was chosen as the initial service provider because of the lack of KYC\nrequirements and the relatively low friction involved in trades. Should new\nexchanges that provide similar benefits list PART, they could be added to the\nmodule, giving users even more options.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll About Adoption and Speed\nThis integration of a BTC-PART payment module is directly in line with the\nteam’s current focus on eliminating the barriers to entry and kickstarting the\nadoption of the Particl network. It significantly increases the potential amount\nof users that can use the Particl ecosystem and makes getting PART as easy as it\nhas ever been.\n\nWIP, Interface Subject to Change (Testnet Only Shows PART to PART Exchange, BTC\non Mainnet Only)While the feature itself is not entirely ready as of the time of\nthis writing, the team has completed the back-end code as well as the testing\nand is currently finalizing the GUI integration. That should be completed within\na few days, and then more testing will be required to make sure its integration\ninto Particl Desktop hasn’t highlighted any new issue. While a definitive\nrelease date cannot be committed to at this moment, we are getting pretty close\nfor the feature to be fully ready. The exchange module will be released as part\nof Particl Desktop 2.3.0.\n\nNote: Particl Desktop 2.2.0 is currently being tested on testnet and should be\nreleased within just a few days. Aside from the new Global Settings feature, it\nwill mostly include bug fixes, flow optimizations, and UI/UX improvements.\nParticl Desktop 2.2.0 and Particl Desktop 2.3.0 are estimated to be released in\nvery close proximity.\n\nThe Pieces are Falling Into Place\nThe Particl team is full steam ahead and working tirelessly on kickstarting the\nadoption of the Particl platform. Stay alert as you can expect some exciting\nnews to be published soon on Particl.news. Suffice to say, the future of Particl\nis looking brighter every day as the pieces of the puzzle are starting to fall\ninto place at a very interesting pace.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Announces-Bitcoin-Exchange-Integration-Into-Particl-Desktop/1-kqXnceUmmgRlUGrFYGulPw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-Announces-Bitcoin-Exchange-Integration-Into-Particl-Desktop/1-SvvDdJMh8rUGGY0sr516iQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>WIP, Interface Subject to Change (Testnet Only Shows PART to PART Exchange, BTC on Mainnet Only)</figcaption></figure><p>Today we’re excited to officially announce more details about Particl’s integration of a Bitcoin exchange module into the Particl Desktop client.

And if a lesson can be learned from previous conferences\nwhere Particl had a booth, there will be little to no rest time for any of these\nteam members. It’s no secret, San Francisco is the world’s biggest incubator of\ntech companies, and so this Blockchain Week is going to be attracting an\nimpressive number of people and companies looking for new and innovative\nblockchain opportunities to leverage.\n\nFor this year’s edition of SFBW’s Epicenter, Particl is going to be having a\nlarge booth for a duration of two days.

This, combined with the Open Marketplace’s near-zero costs,\nwill create a huge opportunity for businesses, allowing them to dramatically\nreduce their costs in a way that simply wouldn’t be possible if using\ntraditional payment methods (as in…not using cryptocurrencies).\n\nOn top of that, Singaporeans and Singaporean businesses are known for being\nparticularly tech-savvy and at the forefront of innovations. The strong benefits\nof the Open Marketplace, combined with the new crypto-friendly tax regulations\nthat are being proposed within the country, make a very strong case for using\nParticl.\n\nFor this reason, the team is going to send Particl’s advisor Miguel Cuneta to\ntouch base with various Singapore-based businesses and demonstrate how they\ncould dramatically optimize their entire business models. While individuals\nstand to save a lot of money per sale selling on Particl, Miguel’s presence at\nthis conference will mostly be focused on reaching out to businesses.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> BlockShow Asia 2019 is one of the major international platforms for showcasing\ninnovative Blockchain solutions revealing hottest industry trends & sensations\nand bringing together Blockchain enthusiasts and experts from all over the world\n(powered by Cointelegraph).The conference will take place on November, 14–15 in\nSingapore, Marina Bay Sands Expo — the city that has earned the distinction as\none of the world’s top destinations for blockchain meetings.\n\nSlush Helsinki — Finland [https://www.slush.org/events/helsinki/] (November\n21–22)\nSlush is a world-renowned startup focused conference.

To maximize its\npresence at the event, Particl will be able to pre-schedule meetings with\nvarious businesses, advisors, investors, and more.
