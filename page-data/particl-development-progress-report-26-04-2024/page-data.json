However, we expect desktop development pace\nto start picking up starting today.\n\n * Update Particl Desktop-related dependencies and modules. (partly completed,\n   focus shifted to items listed below)\n * Diagnose and fix a problem with how market identities behave. (priority)\n * Diagnose and fix an issue with the editing of Seller Templates. (priority)\n * Tie marketplace content moderation voting threshold to circulating supply.\n * Improve proxy connections (better Tor functionality, add i2p, etc).\n * Allow for transactions to be abandoned on PD before they are confirmed.\n * Default display of chat messages to newest message receive.\n\nRemember that, in the interest of pushing updates more quickly and as the array\nof dependency updates are rather time-consuming due to the accrued development\ndebts of the past few months, we may opt to push out Particl Desktop 3.3.3 with\nmost of the updates and fixes mentioned above included, and push a subsequent\nupdate (i.e., 3.3.4) addressing the remaining larger dependency updates.\n\n> Note: Particl Desktop development is currently being worked on on a part-time\nbasis, which is expected to result in slower development pace compared to Core\nor BasicSwap DEX. However, we expect to resume development of this department on\na full-time capacity in the near future.\nParticl Marketplace Moderation ?️\nIn our commitment to maintaining the safety and integrity of Particl\nMarketplace, we've resumed our research into a better, more efficient content\nmoderation system. Those familiar with the project know about the\nalready-existing crowdsourced moderation system which, while functional, is\nstill in its early stages and needs further refinement to effectively minimize\nexposure to undesirable content for the end-user while improving it's\npro-activity.\n\nModerating a decentralized marketplace without introducing central points of\nfailure is a real challenge. On one hand, it cannot put too much responsibility\non end-users, as that means they have to be constantly exposed to undesirable\ncontent so that they can vote it out. But on the other hand, it also cannot put\nthat responsibility into specific users, moderation staff, groups of people, or\norganizations, as that defeats the very purpose of a decentralized system and\nintroduces central points of failure and liability.\n\nOur proposed solution would leverage Particl's staking pools, voting delegation,\nand the potential of LLM (large language models) to more proactively moderate\ncontent. This innovative approach would allow for pre-screening based on\ncommunity-driven policies, removing inappropriate listings before they even\nreach users. The end result is a painless user experience that is free from\nundesirable content and doesn't require the end-user to act as a moderator and\nbe exposed to undesirable content.\n\nKeep in mind that this system is still theoretical, with ongoing research\nfocused on integrating LLM capabilities and refining the implementation strategy\nwithout any sacrifice to the level of decentralization or privacy. Once fully\ndeployed, this model could lead the way in terms of decentralized moderation\nwithout central points of failure or undue burden on users.\n\nWe will continue our research and provide a detailed update on Particl News once\nwe finalize the design. This approach, if successful, could set a precedent for\naddressing moderation challenges in decentralized environments without\nsacrifices to decentralization.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core.

anonymity in\ncryptocurrencies and decentralized systems, we share our thoughts on the purpose\nof privacy in decentralized eCommerce platforms, specifically with regards to\nprotecting user safety and data sovereignty.\n\nA Brief Reminder of Bitcoin’s History\nNearly two decades ago, Bitcoin was introduced as a digital currency aiming to\nprovide financial freedom and personal sovereignty globally, irrespective of\none's background or circumstances.\n\nAnd while it spawned an incredible revolution, both in technological progress\nand online discourse, the proposed solution unfortunately fell short of\naccomplishing its stated mission.\n\nAn Unfortunate Reality\nContrary to early assumptions, Bitcoin transactions are far from private. In\nfact, they often fare worse than traditional fiat currencies in preserving\nfinancial confidentiality. Indeed, fiat systems typically handle fund transfers\nthrough secured channels designed to safeguard users' financial data from\nunauthorized public exposure.\n\nIn stark contrast, all Bitcoin transactions are permanently recorded on a public\nledger, openly exposing the entirety of one's financial details to any curious\nobserver. While Bitcoin's pseudonymous nature may foster a sense of anonymity in\nlimited contexts, this perception is increasingly recognized as a dangerous\nillusion.\n\nIn fact, transaction tracing capabilities have advanced significantly in the\npast few years, driven in part by regulatory requirements like\nKnow-Your-Customer (KYC) compliance that have necessitated increased transaction\nmonitoring by financial services.\n\nHistorically, only regulatory bodies and financial institutions had access to\ndetailed reports of users' on-chain financial histories through partnerships\nwith blockchain analytics firms however, the ability to effectively deanonymize\ntransactions and map them to real-world identities is rapidly proliferating to\nnew actors — most concerningly, criminals, hackers, and other malicious entities\nintent on exploiting this data for financial gain at the expense of unsuspecting\nvictims — thanks to the rapid evolution of large language models and artificial\nintelligence that have spawned widely accessible tracing protocols.\n\nThese escalating privacy vulnerabilities underscore the paramount importance of\ndeveloping robust privacy-preserving solutions for cryptocurrencies across the\nglobe, such as, among others, ”privacy coins”. Maintaining financial\nconfidentiality is not merely a luxury but an essential capability to safeguard\nusers operating in these systems.\n\nBitcoin and eCommerce\nHowever, when it comes to decentralized commerce – the logical evolution beyond\ndecentralized currencies – merely utilizing privacy coins is not sufficient.\nWhile on-chain transactions may be inherently private, the platforms\nfacilitating purchases and sales represent another significant attack vector\nthat must be addressed.\n\nAs regulatory obligations evolve, businesses operating centralized\ncryptocurrency platforms may be compelled to collect extensive user information,\nincluding transaction histories, associated identities, IP addresses, shipping\ndetails from buyers, sales data from sellers, and more. While one could\nreasonably expect regulatory bodies to handle such information responsibly, the\nsame assurances cannot be extended to the platforms themselves, as highlighted\nin our previous articles on the imperatives of privacy here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/] \nand here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-the-need-to-own-your-data-19bc31b0ec74/]\n.\n\nBut even if all platforms always acted in good faith, this centralized\naggregation of sensitive data becomes an enticing target for hackers and other\nmalicious actors seeking to exploit personal and financial information for\nillicit gains.\n\nThe Inherent Safety Risks of DeCommerce\nThe logical solution, therefore, is to develop an eCommerce platform that is as\ndecentralized as cryptocurrencies themselves. Such a platform would operate in a\npurely peer-to-peer manner, built upon a truly decentralized architecture devoid\nof single points of failure or centralized components. The objective is to offer\nservices akin to centralized eCommerce giants like eBay or Amazon, but without\nany central entity, thus eliminating the associated costs, fees, and frictions\ninherent to intermediaries. A \"decentralized online marketplace\", embodying\nBitcoin's ethos, and providing a clear user experience improvement over\ncentralized counterparts without data collection.\n\nHowever, while recent advancements in blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies\nenable such decentralized eCommerce platforms, they also introduce new\nchallenges in preserving users' financial data privacy and safety.\n\nPicture this scenario: You open a decentralized marketplace, hoping to purchase\na new computer online. You browse available listings from sellers worldwide and\nfind a suitable item. You proceed to add it to your cart and checkout, providing\nthe seller with your shipping address. Herein lies a significant safety concern;\nif you've paid using pseudonymous cryptocurrencies, you've likely revealed your\nphysical location alongside your entire financial history, including balances\nand past transactions.\n\nIn most cases, such disclosures may be innocuous, however, over an extended\nperiod, you or someone else may inadvertently expose critical details to\nmalicious actors, which could be used to identify and target the potential\nvictim. This risk vector is particularly concerning for high net-worth\nindividuals, as every purchase they make could effectively paint a target on\ntheir backs, making this situation simply unsustainable.\n\nCentralized platforms like eBay or Amazon typically circumvent this issue, as\npayments are facilitated through highly regulated centralized providers like\nPayPal, among others. While these entities face valid criticisms, they at least\navoid exposing users' complete financial histories on pseudonymous ledgers.\n\nHowever, a decentralized platform, by its very nature, does not rely on payment\nprocessors. Instead, it enables direct peer-to-peer trade between buyers and\nsellers. Consequently, an alternative solution must be implemented to preserve\nusers' financial privacy and security.\n\nThe Need for Privacy in DeCommerce\nParticl Marketplace addresses these concerns with its decentralized and secure\nonline marketplace, often touted as a privacy-first eCommerce solution. It\nensures user safety by providing robust privacy safeguards in two critical\nareas.\n\nTransactional Privacy\nFirst, it facilitates complete transactional privacy for counterparties through\nthe use of PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, which integrates advanced\non-chain privacy protocols. Two specific protocols are instrumental in\npreserving financial confidentiality: Confidential Transactions (\"CT\") and ring\nsignatures (\"RingCT\").\n\nCT transactions conceal the transfer amounts between parties, while RingCT\nobfuscates both transaction amounts and participant identities. However, RingCT\ntransactions lack programmable outputs, rendering them incompatible with\ndecentralized applications like Particl Marketplace. To address this limitation,\nRingCT inputs can be mapped to CT outputs, which possess programmable\ncapabilities. By chaining these protocols, Particl Marketplace effectively\nharnesses RingCT's enhanced privacy while facilitating seamless integration,\nproviding users with safety — which is otherwise entirely absent without\ntransactional privacy — and the assurance that their financial data remains\nconfidential during transactions.\n\nData-free Marketplace Activity\nSecondly, Particl Marketplace addresses the concerns surrounding excessive data\ncollection practices by centralized eCommerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, and\nEtsy, which have faced criticism for undermining user privacy. Some platforms\nhave even exploited user data to directly compete with their own sellers, as\nexemplified by AmazonBasics products and other Amazon sub-brands – an issue we\nhave previously explored in depth here\n[https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/].\n\nMoreover, while platforms claim to harvest data to enhance user experiences,\ntracking shopping habits can inadvertently expose sensitive information without\nconsent. A notable example is the Target pregnancy prediction case, in which an\nunsuspecting father learned of his daughter's pregnancy due to ad targeting – a\nscenario we’ve also previously discussed here\n[https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/].\n\nTo safeguard against such privacy infringements and data misuse, Particl\nMarketplace is designed to eliminate data generation, collection, storage, or\ndistribution entirely – encompassing both financial and non-financial metadata.\nAll marketplace activity data is stored locally, and all data transmitted (such\nas buyer-seller communications or shipping details) is conveyed through\nend-to-end encrypted messages via SMSG, a peer-to-peer data and messaging\nplatform (\"mixnet\") operating alongside Particl Core nodes\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/].\n\nThis privacy-first architecture ensures user safety and guarantees complete data\nownership and control, while preventing malicious data extraction through hacks,\nexploits, or the simple act of buying or selling online.\n\nConclusion\nWhile various accessibility, usability, and user-experience improvements are\nstill needed, the end result is a decentralized online marketplace that\neliminates fees and associated frictions inherent to third-party intermediaries\nwithin the eCommerce domain.\n\nHowever, beyond these benefits, it primarily serves as a secure platform for\ncryptocurrency users to engage in direct peer-to-peer trade without compromising\ntheir safety by exposing financial information to potentially malicious\nstrangers.\n\nAs we have aimed to clarify with this blog post, privacy in the context of\ncryptocurrency usage transcends a luxury or edge case. In scenarios such as\neCommerce/deCommerce, it is an absolute necessity to ensure the safety and\nwell-being of users transacting with unknown counterparties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

for seamless and\npractical decentralized commerce solutions remains a driving force. Although\nthis is a self-evident use case for crypto, comprehensive solutions to use\ndecentralized money as money, without relying on heavily centralized\narchitecture, is lacking.\n\nWhile achieving this goal has proven challenging, this article explores how\nintegrating BasicSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) that offers Litecoin\npairs, into Particl Marketplace, a decentralized e-commerce platform, offers a\nsolution to overcome many user experience obstacles that have come to hinder the\nevolution of cryptocurrencies as a medium of payment.\n\nBy providing multi-currency support\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-integration-unlocking-currency-agnostic-commerce-on-particl/] \nto the decentralized e-commerce ecosystem, this upcoming integration offers a\ntangible path forward for many coins, unlocking the potential for widespread\ncryptocurrency usage in everyday retail transactions.\n\nWith this in mind, Litecoin, with its focused push as a payment currency, serves\nas the perfect candidate to illustrate this transformative potential, allowing\nanyone to use Litecoin for shopping.\n\nLitecoin; Faster and Cheaper Transactions\nLitecoin has garnered significant attention for its faster transaction times and\nlower fees compared to Bitcoin – a stark contrast to the latter's reputation for\nsluggish and costly processing. This, from the beginning, has positioned\nLitecoin as an ideal cryptocurrency for payments and commerce. Recognizing its\nstrengths in speed and affordability, the Litecoin community has been actively\npromoting its adoption as a practical and viable payment solution for years now.\n\nLitecoin MWEB and Privacy: Solidifying Litecoin as True Digital Cash\nLitecoin's MWEB (MimbleWimble Extension Blocks) introduces a significant\nimprovement to an already payment-friendly digital currency: transactional\nprivacy. This brings confidential transactions and privacy features to the\nLitecoin network, a pivotal development poised to solidify its positioning as\ntrue digital cash and a viable currency for payments.\n\nPrivacy is, of course, a crucial aspect in the realm of digital payments, as it\nsafeguards users' and businesses' financial information and promotes fungibility\n– a fundamental characteristic of sound money.\n\nParticl Marketplace: Redefining Decentralized E-Commerce\nWhile transactional privacy is paramount, it is also crucial for the platform\nfacilitating such payments to uphold privacy as well.\n\nEnvision this scenario: you send a private payment using Litecoin MWEB or even\nMonero to purchase an item online. However, you later discover that this\nplatform has been collecting user data and subsequently fell victim to a data\nbreach, exposing your shipping information, shopping history, along with\naddresses and payment details to an attacker. An absolute nightmare, even if the\ninitial payment was conducted through a private transaction.\n\nThis underscores the fact that private payments alone are insufficient to\ncompletely safeguard your shopping habits and selling history. This fact stands\nas a premise for the design of Particl Marketplace.\n\nParticl Marketplace is a decentralized, privacy-focused e-commerce platform\nbuilt using blockchain and peer-to-peer technology. Unlike traditional\ne-commerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, Etsy, or Alibaba, Particl Marketplace\noperates without intermediaries, ensuring secure and private transactions\nbetween users, free from fees or restrictions. Buyers and sellers transact\ndirectly, benefiting from a two-party escrow system that protects both parties\nand keeps all trade information private to the involved parties only.\n\nUsing Litecoin for Shopping on Particl Marketplace Soon to be AvailableWhile the\nplatform's unapologetically decentralized nature and privacy features make it an\nattractive alternative to centralized e-commerce platforms (which often face\ncensorship, data breaches, and other vulnerabilities), it is currently limited\nto using PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, as the settlement currency. This\nis due to PART’s unique technology being an integral component in enabling some\nof the marketplace's unique features in the first place.\n\nBasicSwap DEX: Enabling Multi-Currency Payments\nLitecoin MWEB Balances and Conversions Live on BasicSwap DEXLitecoin\nMimbleWimble balances and balance conversions are now live on BasicSwap DEX, a\nfirst step towards full MWEB swaps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/litecoin-mweb-balances-and-conversions-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\nBasicSwap DEX is a decentralized exchange protocol and platform powered by\natomic swaps and SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a distributed data and\nmessaging protocol (often referred to as a “mixnet”). It offers a non-custodial\nand privacy-first trading experience, enabling trustless cross-chain swaps\nbetween different cryptocurrencies across various blockchains. And just like\nParticl Marketplace, it imposes no fees, restrictions, or data collection\npractices.\n\nAnd while it has always included Litecoin since its inception, it recently\nintegrated MWEB balances, paving the way for full MWEB swaps once Litecoin's\nupcoming core update — which will detect incoming Litecoin transactions using\nonly the viewkey without requiring the spendkey — goes live.\n\nTrade Litecoin on BasicSwap DEX (Litecoin DEX)By integrating BasicSwap into\nParticl Marketplace, alternative payment options are introduced at the time of\ncheckout, allowing users to seamlessly pay for items using their preferred\ncryptocurrency, a prime candidate of which being the fast and private Litecoin\nMWEB token.\n\nThis synergy aligns perfectly with Litecoin's vision of becoming a viable and\npractical form of digital cash, providing an additional real-world use case that\nfurther solidifies its position.\n\nBuilding Bridges Between Cryptocurrencies\nThe upcoming integration of BasicSwap and Litecoin MWEB on Particl Marketplace\nexemplifies BasicSwap's broader mission of forging bridges between diverse\ncryptocurrency communities and projects through its cross-chain functionality.\nThis synergy unites our efforts toward a shared vision of building a global\neconomy that prioritizes sovereignty and interoperability - the great promise of\ncrypto.\n\nBy enabling the use of Litecoin on Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap fosters a\nsymbiotic relationship that holds immense promise.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
