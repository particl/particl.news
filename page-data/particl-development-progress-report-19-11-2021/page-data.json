This week, we've got some exciting new feature to announce\nwhich is going to be part of the upcoming Particl Desktop update (3.1). And\nnobody expected it this soon! ?\n\nIndeed, Particl Desktop developer Arnold Bansemer initially started the week\nfocusing on adding alternative delivery methods for digital items. Upon looking\nat the code, he stumbled onto something interesting.\n\nIf you recall correctly, one of the current roadmap items is the ability to\nadjust the value of the escrow security deposit. It is also one of the top\nrequests we've received both from vendors and non-vendors following the release\nof Particl V3 on mainnet. As it turns out, due to the new, improved codebase\nintroduced by Particl V3, adding this feature ended up being a relatively easy\nand quick task to do.\n\nAs a result, we are happy to confirm that the \"adjustable escrow\" roadmap item\nis now complete and merged into the Particl Desktop code, meaning that it'll be\nactivated on the very next update (3.1). \n\nAt this time, custom ratios (0% to 100% of the value of the item being\npurchased) can only be decided by the seller at the time of creating a listing.\nTo ensure unaware users aren't met with bad surprises, any listing containing\ncustom ratios will clearly indicate it, and buyers will be forced to manually\ncheck a box confirming that they are aware of the custom ratios before checking\nout their cart.\n\nAdjustable Escrow Preview (UI WIP)Now let's have a look at the progress made on\nthe other items.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Report\nBecause the majority of the week has been spent on integrating the adjustable\nescrow feature, the previously stated Particl Desktop \"to-do\" list has remained\nmore or less the same, with a few minor exceptions.\n\n * Several features related to better vendor inventory import/update. We can\n   report that the ability to batch update prices to multiple listings at once\n   is now completed. The addition of a product code and the ability to import\n   images directly through the CSV file directly is still in progress, however,\n   we're now moving these two tasks for AFTER the completion of the enabling of\n   digital items. Both of these items are relatively easy to wrap up and we'd\n   rather focus on the more complicated task first.\n * Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address\n   requirement (i.e., download links, NFTs, user codes, etc.). This task has\n   been started this week and will be the primary focus for next week.\n * The usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace for better,\n   more customizable formatting. This task has already been started but has been\n   put on pause until the above items are completed. It is estimated that this\n   item will be completed very quickly once its development resumes.\n\nParticl Core Progress Report\nThis week on Core, work has gone towards keeping Particl Core up-to-date with\nBitcoin's codebase. As always, you can track the progress by looking into the \nlist of commits on the Github repository\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]. It provides valuable\ninsights into what's being done on that side of things. \n\nTo that end, a new Particl Core release (Particl Core 0.19.2.17\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.17]) has been\npublished and is now marked as a full release. You can download it here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.17] and consult\nthe list of changes here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019217]\n.\n\nRelease Particl Core 0.19.2.17 · particl/particl-coreRelease\nNotes:https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.19/doc/release-notes-particl.md#019217Hashes109cc332e88da32d94ca94dfc401568bde323992a29b13a3afc7274d2d7c7422\nparticl-0.19.2.17-aarch...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.17]Additionally,\ndevelopment on BasicSwap has continued as is now usual.

In fact, this week, the guys at\nLocalParticl.com released yet another awesome Particl product; a web browser\nthat lets you explore what's for sale on Particl Marketplace\n[https://particlmarketplace.shop].\n\nUsing your favorite web browser, you can now discover the many items and\nservices currently for sale on the Open Market (Particl Marketplace's default\nmarket). When clicking on an item, you can also find buttons that will allow you\nto share it anywhere online; a feature that's quite useful for sellers to\npromote their items and for Particl fans to show others what kind of stuff can\nbe sold on the marketplace.\n\nThe web browser is currently an early work-in-progress and is expected to evolve\nas we march onwards.\n\nWe'd like to give a big shout-out to the LocalParticl team. With their\never-growing line of products (LocalParticl.com [https://localparticl.com], \nWizardSwap.io [https://WizardSwap.io], web browser\n[https://particlmarketplace.shop/#]), they keep on expanding the ecosystem and\nmaking Particl better by the day. We absolutely love to see community efforts\nlike these and thank them immensely for their contributions! \n\n> Note: At the time this was written, the web browser appears to be out of sync\nwith the marketplace. We expect the LocalParticl team to fix the issue quickly.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe thank you all for your passion and love for the Particl mission; we couldn't\ndo it without your incredible support.\n\nWe wish you all a wonderful weekend, we'll see you back on Monday! ?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

It lets you make or take orders on a distributed\norder book and execute swaps that are safe, trustless, unrestricted, and\nprivate. To find out what makes it a one-of-a-kind DEX, keep on reading this\nblog post!\n\nMockup of BasicSwap's UI | Work-in-progress that is subject to changeParticl’s\nupcoming DEX is powered by the atomic swap technology\n[https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/08/20/a-beginners-guide-to-atomic-swaps/] \nand the SMSG network\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_mp_explained.html#the-securemessaging-smsg-protocol]\n, making it entirely decentralized and devoid of any central operator. No KYC,\nno trickery, no false promises. Just pure decentralization and privacy. And yes,\nin case you were wondering, it is fully compatible with Monero (XMR) and will be\nright from the get-go! ?\n\nIn this blog post, we will take a deep look into this new Particl distributed\napplication. We’ll detail how it’s going to fit in as a critical component of\nthe Particl ecosystem and, perhaps even more importantly, ensure the personal\nfreedom and financial sovereignty of its users.\n\nTable of Contents\n * The Particl Ecosystem Explained\n * The BasicSwap DEX Explained\n * List of Compatible Coins\n * Key Features\n * Monetization\n * How Does it Compare?\n * Why is BasicSwap Sorely Needed?\n * Open Beta Coming Soon\n\nThe Particl Ecosystem Explained\nThe first step to understanding the significance of BasicSwap’s upcoming release\nfor Particl is to get a good grasp of what the Particl ecosystem is.\n\nParticl Marketplace, accessible through Particl DesktopParticl is an ecosystem\nthat gives you the ability to live completely free by cutting off middlemen\nentirely. It’s a platform that hosts different apps that respect your rights,\nfreedoms, and privacy without any compromise. While it’s still under heavy\ndevelopment, Particl aspires to become an all-inclusive and circular economy\nthat people can use to opt-out of the current global financial system. In other\nwords, it’s all about personal freedom and financial sovereignty.\n\nIn many ways, the ultimate vision of the platform can be compared as a sort of\n“decentralized and private WeChat-like ecosystem” where you can get all the key\nservices or products you need right at your fingertips. Alternatively, you can\nalso see it as an OS-like platform for distributed apps. In any case, Particl is\nan ecosystem of distributed apps, or “dapps”, where independence from any\nthird-party or service provider is absolute. And BasicSwap is an incredibly\nimportant step towards that vision.\n\nIn fact, as the Particl ecosystem enables you to become truly financially\nindependent, it’s easy to understand how an equally independent, resilient, and\nunstoppable way to buy and sell the platform’s native currency (PART) is\nrequired. However, at the time of this writing, PART is only available through\ncentralized exchanges or by unprotected OTC deals between two people. While\ncentralized exchanges (i.e., Bittrex\n[https://global.bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-PART], WizardSwap\n[https://wizardswap.io/]) can provide many benefits and unique features, not\nhaving any decentralized option is not an option for a platform that seeks to be\nuncompromisingly independent. But that’s all about to change!\n\nNow let’s dive deeper into BasicSwap and let’s see how it’s going to become a\ncornerstone for the entire Particl ecosystem. We'll also detail how it will\nbecome a competitive and vibrant trading platform for all cryptocurrencies that\nend up on it.\n\nThe BasicSwap DEX Explained\nKeeping in mind that the Particl ecosystem is your gateway into a completely\nindependent and autonomous economy, it’s vital to be able to acquire (and sell\nor trade) the platform’s native currency in an equally independent, safe, fast,\nand decentralized way. That’s precisely what the BasicSwap DEX enables you to\ndo, but it doesn’t stop at just buying and selling PART.\n\nMockup of BasicSwap's UI | Work-in-progress that is subject to changeBasicSwap\nis a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol. It lets you swap one cryptocurrency\nfor another from a different chain (cross-chain). It’s also private by nature. \n\nSwaps are made directly person-to-person, without any intermediary, using a\ndistributed order book. Every single aspect of the BasicSwap protocol is\ndecentralized and open-source, so you don’t have to take our word for it; you\ncan check the code yourself!\n\nList of Compatible Coins\n * Bitcoin\n * Monero\n * Particl\n * Litecoin\n * Namecoin\n\nWe are looking at adding various coins, including ETH and its ERC-20 tokens,\nshortly after the release of the Open Beta. Any Bitcoin-based and Segwit enabled\ncryptocurrency can get integrated with minimal effort. Other token issuing\nblockchains like Fantom, Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, or Binance Smart Chain may\nbecome available on BasicSwap as well, at a later stage of the integration\nroadmap.\n\nKey Features\nBasicSwap is a one-of-its-kind DEX in the blockchain industry. While it offers\nmany benefits against centralized exchanges, it has three main distinguishing\nfeatures that set it apart from other decentralized exchanges.\n\nDistributed Order Books\nBasicSwap’s first version will focus on trading with an order book. Instead of\nswapping your coins into a liquidity pool (like on Uniswap, SushiSwap, or\nPancakeSwap), you can either place an order on the distributed order book\n(maker), at the price that you want, or take an order that has already been\nplaced on there by other swappers (taker). In many ways, this makes BasicSwap\nmore akin to the typical centralized exchanges most people are used to trading\non, but with a totally decentralized and private twist.\n\nNote that, unlike the vast majority of DEXs that offer order books, BasicSwap’s\norder book system is truly distributed and doesn’t introduce any form of\ncentralization. No funny business here; BasicSwap makes it truly impossible, by\ndesign, for any third-party to have uncalled influence on the platform, and\nthat's provably verifiable through code! The order book is powered by Particl’s\nown P2P network, SMSG network\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_mp_explained.html#the-securemessaging-smsg-protocol]\n, which is the same network that powers Particl Marketplace\n[https://particl.io/marketplace].\n\nThe main benefit of having an order book system is that you can swap coins at\nthe exact price that you want to swap them for. It also attracts more\ntraditional market makers who may not want to provide liquidity to\nsmart-contract based liquidity pools due to the risks of rug pulls\n[https://learn.bybit.com/investing/why-crypto-rug-pulls-happen-in-defi/] and\nother theoretical exploits they carry.\n\nBut there’s more coming to BasicSwap! You can expect “quick swaps” to be\ndeployed at some point in the future. As a matter of fact, this is already being\nlooked into at the time of this writing! We will let you know more about it as\nsoon (™) as we can!\n\nTrue Cross-Chain Swaps\nParticl’s upcoming DEXs is a true cross-chain trading exchange. Unlike other\nDEX, BasicSwap does not mimic cross-chain interoperability. You’ll exchange one\nnative coin for another one without any unsafe trickery!\n\nYou can swap one coin (i.e., Bitcoin) for one from another blockchain (i.e.,\nMonero). And no, we’re not just talking about swapping coins between different\nEthereum forks here (i.e., ETH to BSC). Moreover, BasicSwap doesn’t require\ncoins to be wrapped into tokens of another chain (often Ethereum, Binance Smart\nChain, or other similar chains).\n\nThe World’s Most Private Trading Exchange\nTo top it off, BasicSwap is inherently private. But what does that mean?! Well,\nit means a few things. For one, you won’t need to create an account, send\ndocuments, verify yourself, or limit your trading activities to arbitrary\nmaximum daily restrictions. It’s open to all, without any restriction, and\nwithout any care about who you are or where you live.\n\nThat’s already a major improvement over centralized exchanges that have become\nway too curious, but you can take things even further! You can indeed massively\nincrease your level of privacy by swapping any cryptocurrency for privacy coins\nlike Particl or Monero, or by using them as a gateway to add a layer of privacy\nbetween two \"public coins\" (i.e,. Bitcoin and Litecoin). \n\nIndeed, all Monero transactions are inherently private, and BasicSwap lets you\nswap PART using any of its privacy states; public, blind (\nConfidentialTransactions\n[https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation]),\nor anon (RingCT\n[https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf]\n). We’re planning on eventually enabling more private swap options through other\nprivacy coins as well (i.e., Firo, Veil, etc).\n\nBut there is STILL more to come in regards to privacy! As we move forward and\ndeploy the Taproot protocol on Particl, you can expect swaps of Bitcoin-style\ncurrencies to become indistinguishable from regular transactions. In other\nwords, it will be eventually near-impossible to tell that, for example, a\nBitcoin to Particl swap has occurred just by looking at their respective\nblockchains. That’s a major win for your financial privacy!\n\nIndeed, enabling Taproot support is planned for a later stage of the Open Beta.\nThat's one of the reasons why Particl's blockchain is always kept up-to-date\nwith Bitcoin’s latest releases. It brings battle-hardened and reliable\nfunctionalities for your day-to-day financial sovereignty!\n\nThe combination of all these privacy-related features will make BasicSwap the\nworld’s most private and unrestricted trading exchange, and that, in turn, will\nmake you completely financially independent. Claim your sovereignty and live\nfree...because, well, now you can!\n\nOther Interesting Features\nThere are a couple of other features that you may find interesting. As BasicSwap\nwill become an important development focus moving forward, this list is expected\nto grow gradually.\n\n * True Monero support\n * No account, sign up, or KYC\n * Incredibly low and competitive fees\n * User-friendly interface\n * No third-party, intermediary, or middleman at any point\n * Taproot compatible\n * Lightning Network compatible (in later versions)\n\nWhat About Monetization?\nAs BasicSwap is entirely decentralized, no single party can earn profits from\nswaps made on the platform. That’d be very...centralized! But rest assured, we\nabsolutely intend on turning Particl’s upcoming DEX into the spark that will\ncause the Particl project to go viral. Indeed, we are strongly confident that\nthe DEX was the missing piece all along.\n\nIndeed, it’s likely that a very small and competitive fee will be charged for\nusing the DEX. But instead of having a third-party collecting them, it’s the\nentire Particl community who will benefit from them. All fees paid for using the\nDEX will be either converted into PART and burned, redistributed to stakers, or\nused as a liquidity incentive. A combination of these three strategies is likely\nto be what’s going to be deployed, although we haven’t finalized the strategy\njust yet and are still experimenting with different approaches.\n\nIn other words, we are working towards building BasicSwap in such a way that, as\nmore people swap coins on the platform, the more demand there will be for the\nPART coin, the less available supply there will be, and the more valuable your\nstaking rewards will be. And that’s just one application out of many others on\nthe Particl ecosystem (Particl Marketplace has a similar dynamic as well).\n\nKeep in mind that we want BasicSwap to provide an experience that has as little\nfriction as possible. We also want any fee charged to remain very competitive\nwith industry standards and, obviously, legally viable.\n\nHow Does it Compare\nWe know we know, there are many exchanges around, both centralized and\ndecentralized. But we’re very confident that BasicSwap stands on its own and\noffers something quite unique.\n\nIn the interest of making it clear how BasicSwap differentiates itself from\nother trading platforms, here’s a brief breakdown of the differences with some\nof the other solutions around.\n\nBittrex, Binance, Coinbase, etc.  Compared to centralized exchanges... \n\nYou control your keys at any point in time You don't have to create an account\nor submit any document You don't need to verify yourself (KYC) There's no upper\nlimit as to how much you can trade per period of time You remain private every\nstep of the way There's no third-party, middleman, or intermediary involved at\nall \n\nUniswap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, etc.  Compared to “quick swap” exchanges with liquidity pools… \n\nYou can place or take orders on a distributed order book You swap your coins at\nthe exact price that you want Swaps are truly cross-chain; no wrapped token\nrequired (i.e., wBTC) Providing liquidity is done in a more traditional way\nusing order books (as opposed to liquidity pools) There's no rug to pull (read\nmore about the infamous rug pulls here\n[https://learn.bybit.com/investing/why-crypto-rug-pulls-happen-in-defi/]) \n\nBISQ  Compared to the BISQ exchange... \n\nThe process of swapping is entirely decentralized and done between two people No\nsecurity deposit or escrow intermediary required Fees are lower Swaps are atomic\nby nature, you can’t be scammed or tricked by bad actors \n\nCOMIT  Compared to the COMIT network... \n\nYou can place or take orders on a distributed order book You swap your coins at\nthe exact price that you want You can swap a vast selection of cryptocurrencies;\nit’s not exclusively Monero-centric Uses the SMSG network to safely execute\nswaps All options and steps are available from a user interface \n\nWhy is BasicSwap Sorely Needed?\nUtility Impact on Particl\nThe most obvious reason for BasicSwap to be is to provide the Particl ecosystem\nwith an independent, autonomous, and private way to swap, buy, and sell the\nnative currency of the platform (PART) for as many other cryptocurrencies as\npossible.\n\nEarly mockup of a BasicSwap integration into Particl Desktop | Work-in-progress\nthat is subject to changeRelying on centralized exchanges and partners can\nprovide useful solutions and avenues to trade PART, but it makes the entire\necosystem dependent on them which is an unbearable risk. With BasicSwap, Particl\nbecomes resilient against any exchange delisting and ensures the longevity of\nthe project no matter what gets thrown at it. In other words, it makes Particl\npermanently unstoppable!\n\nPromoting and Supporting Financial Sovereignty\nAt this time, with all of the promises and potential that cryptocurrencies\nyield, speculation is still their number one use case. Every day, billions upon\nbillions worth of dollars in cryptocurrencies are traded on exchanges, both\ncentralized and decentralized.\n\nFurthermore, with the looming aggressive regulations that certain countries wish\nto impose on crypto, especially towards coins that protect your private life,\ncentralized exchanges have been more and more restrictive while asking for more\nand more information about you and your funds. This locks several people out of\ntrading cryptocurrencies in a practical matter and this problem is expected to\naccentuate as we move forward. Keep in mind, this is far from being a\nParticl-centric issue, but rather an industry-wide issue that’s impacting\nthousands if not millions of users, daily.\n\nWith this in mind, BasicSwap is a beacon of light in an environment that grows\ndarker by the day for those who care about their financial sovereignty. By\ngiving anyone the ability to easily swap cryptocurrencies from one chain to\nanother, without any sort of restriction or overreaching requirements, it allows\npeople to remain independent and keep their financial details to themselves.\n\nAs a matter of fact, never ever will BasicSwap ask you for any information or\nrestrict you from using its services based on arbitrary rules such as who you\nare, where you live, or what your transaction history may look like; it’s\nentirely decentralized, autonomous, and open to all! This, alone, is bound to\nattract freedom lovers, giving the Particl project much deserved attention from\nthis audience.\n\nExposure for the Project\nBecause of how the Particl ecosystem and its distributed apps are all\ninterconnected, we expect a non-negligible portion of BasicSwap users to start\nusing other Particl apps and become Particl-wide users. That’s likely to\naccentuate much more as soon as the DEX gets integrated into Particl Desktop.\nAfter all, there’s much more to trading crypto, you’ve got to spend your gains\nas well! And, lo and behold, that’s precisely what Particl Marketplace lets you\ndo (and you STILL stay completely private when doing so).\n\nFor this reason, BasicSwap is eventually going to become a major focus in terms\nof communications, marketing, PR, and outreach efforts, on the same level and as\na complement to the marketplace.\n\nThat being said, the upcoming release of BasicSwap is a golden opportunity for\nParticl to become viral and become successful. Remember, billions upon billions\nworth of cryptocurrencies are traded every day, and BasicSwap’s unique set of\nfeatures is bound to capture even just a tiny fraction of that pie.\n\nIndeed, as the main use-case for cryptocurrencies is currently speculation,\nreleasing a highly functional and one-of-a-kind cross-chain and private DEX is a\nmajor bid in that direction. We highly encourage you all to help us spread the\ngood word about it to kick start its adoption. For all of us in the community,\nit’s sure going to bring a breath of fresh air to be able to market a new\nproduct other than the marketplace!\n\nEasier User Onboarding for Particl Marketplace\nAll payments on Particl Marketplace [https://particl.io/marketplace] are\nprivate. That's why you need to hold some PART coins in your \"anon balance\" to\nuse it. The anon balance is where the coins that you own that are in the RingCT\nprivacy state (click here to learn more\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_part_coin.html#privacy-specifications]\n) are located.\n\nAnd because all current PART exchanges (i.e., Bittrex, Probit, WizardSwap, etc.)\nwork using public balances only, getting started with the marketplace requires\nnew users to go through a few additional, manual steps to transfer coins from\ntheir public balance to the anon one. This has often been reported as a\nsignificant challenge to the marketplace's adoption, and BasicSwap provides a\nsimple solution to that problem.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, BasicSwap lets you swap PART using the balance type of\nyour choice. You can swap it against almost any other cryptocurrency, for\nexample, Bitcoin, and use either your public, blind, or anon (marketplace-ready)\nbalances to send or receive the PART. If you choose to swap the Bitcoin for PART\nusing your anon balance, then as soon as the swap completes, you'll be ready to\nuse the marketplace right away!\n\nIncreasing Demand for PART, Decreasing Supply, and Growing Staking Rewards\nAs you now know, we are looking into several monetization mechanisms to benefit\nthe entire Particl ecosystem for the success of BasicSwap. Mind you, nothing is\nset in stone yet, but this includes mechanisms that would increase the demand\nfor PART, reduce its circulating supply (burning coins), and introduce\nincentives for providing liquidity.\n\nOf course, it’s very important to keep the costs of using the DEX as low as\npossible so that it remains competitive with other solutions. It’s also\nimportant to keep it as frictionless as possible because the easier it is to\nuse, the more people will use it. We'll communicate to the community what\nmonetization strategies will be deployed as early as we can!\n\nWhen is the Open Beta Going Live?\nCurrently, BasicSwap is in closed beta and has been in a testing phase for\nseveral months now. An Open Beta, on mainnet and open to the public, is now just\nabout to launch. While we cannot yet give an estimate on its launch date, we\nexpect it to go live before the end of the year 2021 as a nice end-of-year\npresent to the community. Keep in mind, that is not guaranteed and should not be\nconsidered any sort of official estimate; this is however what we’re hoping for.\n\nWhat to Expect From the Open Beta?\nBy any means, the Open Beta is not intended to be a finished product and will\nstill very much be a beta product in beta phase. As such, you can expect a rough\nexperience that isn’t all that much focused on user-friendliness. As its name\nimplies, the “Open Beta” is intended to beta test the core features of the DEX\nand to ensure that the back-end works safely and as expected over a vast\nselection of environments and situations.\n\nHere are a few notes of what you can expect from the upcoming Open Beta phase.\n\n * Full mainnet functionality with swaps working with real coins\n * Compatibility with Bitcoin, Monero, Litecoin, Namecoin, and Particl. More\n   coins will be added incrementally, especially around the time of the full\n   release. We are already in touch with a few projects for integrations; the\n   number of coins available on the DEX may grow rapidly once that becomes a\n   bigger focus.\n * You will need to manually build the client following a set of instructions.\n   There won’t be executables or one-click options to get started just yet, but\n   rest assured that we have great solutions in the pipeline to simplify\n   onboarding as much as possible.\n * A basic, barebone, and temporary user interface. The Open Beta won’t use, at\n   least not to start with, any of the standalone or Particl Desktop mockups\n   that we’ve shared in the past just yet. The Open Beta is for testers to test\n   the back-end and technical features and is generally recommended for the more\n   advanced types of users.\n * You will need to sync the blockchain of most of the coins you want to swap\n   (excluding Monero, which you can simply sync to a public node). We plan on\n   taking that requirement away in future versions of BasicSwap.\n * As with any beta software, you might encounter bugs or weird behaviors. Don’t\n   worry, that’s why we’re doing an extensive Beta phase! So far, we are happy\n   to confirm that, due to the safe and fail-proof nature of atomic swaps, we\n   (including the closed beta group of testers) haven’t encountered any swap\n   that failed and resulted in the loss of coins. Still, do keep in mind that\n   it’s better to be safe than sorry and to ideally trade small amounts rather\n   than large ones. It’s still early technology after all!\n\nOf course, that is not all. We have many surprises in the works which we intend\non revealing soon (™). We are likely to add surprise features throughout the\nlifecycle of this Open Beta phase, so as we often say; stay tuned!\n\nWhat’s Left to do Before the Open Beta Goes Live?\nAs we rapidly near the release of the Open Beta, we’re checking off the last few\nitems that remain on the to-do list. In reality, there isn’t much left to do as\nan insane amount of work has been silently going towards BasicSwap for several\nmonths now. Here are the last items needed to be completed before the Open Beta\nrelease.\n\n * More testing and optimizations, notably related to the building and\n   installation process.\n * Finish up the temporary UI for the Open Beta so that it’s easier to test.\n * Catching and fixing edge-case issues and other minor bugs.\n\nOnce these items are completed, we’ll be ready to release the BasicSwap Open\nBeta to the public. We’ll clearly communicate, as soon as we can, when it will\ngo live.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs we’ve hopefully made clear by now, we have big plans for BasicSwap and\nstrongly believe it can make Particl go viral and speed up the adoption and\nsuccess of the entire Particl platform. Perhaps more importantly, it is a major\nplay towards preserving everyone’s freedom and financial sovereignty. The\nbenefits BasicSwap opens up to the cryptocurrency industry go much, much further\nthan simply being helpful for the Particl community.\n\nAs such, we have a lot more planned than what we’ve mentioned in this blog post,\nbut we obviously don’t want to play all of our cards yet. After all, the\ninfamous “soon (™)” motto has to live on! ?\n\nSo, most definitely keep a keen eye on Particl News and look out for any update\neither in blog posts dedicated to BasicSwap or in our weekly development\nprogress reports. You’re bound to be mesmerized!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

It’s a platform that hosts different apps that respect your rights, freedoms, and privacy without any compromise. While it’s still under heavy development, Particl aspires to become an all-inclusive and circular economy that people can use to opt-out of the current global financial system. In other words, it’s all about personal freedom and financial sovereignty.</p><p>In many ways, the ultimate vision of the platform can be compared as a sort of “decentralized and private WeChat-like ecosystem” where you can get all the key services or products you need right at your fingertips. Alternatively, you can also see it as an OS-like platform for distributed apps. In any case, Particl is an ecosystem of distributed apps, or “dapps”, where independence from any third-party or service provider is absolute. And BasicSwap is an incredibly important step towards that vision.</p><p>In fact, as the Particl ecosystem enables you to become truly financially independent, it’s easy to understand how an equally independent, resilient, and unstoppable way to buy and sell the platform’s native currency (PART) is required. However, at the time of this writing, PART is only available through centralized exchanges or by unprotected OTC deals between two people. While centralized exchanges (i.e., <a href=\"https://global.bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-PART\">Bittrex</a>, <a href=\"https://wizardswap.io/\">WizardSwap</a>) can provide many benefits and unique features, <strong>not having any decentralized option is not an option for a platform that seeks to be uncompromisingly independent</strong>. But that’s all about to change!</p><p>Now let’s dive deeper into BasicSwap and let’s see how it’s going to become a cornerstone for the entire Particl ecosystem. We'll also detail how it will become a competitive and vibrant trading platform for all cryptocurrencies that end up on it.</p><h2 id=\"the-basicswap-dex-explained\">The BasicSwap DEX Explained</h2><p>Keeping in mind that the Particl ecosystem is your gateway into a completely independent and autonomous economy, it’s vital to be able to acquire (and sell or trade) the platform’s native currency in an equally independent, safe, fast, and decentralized way. That’s precisely what the BasicSwap DEX enables you to do, but it doesn’t stop at just buying and selling PART.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 1823w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption>Mockup of BasicSwap's UI | Work-in-progress that is subject to change</figcaption></figure><p>BasicSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol. It lets you swap one cryptocurrency for another from a different chain (cross-chain). It’s also private by nature. </p><p>Swaps are made directly person-to-person, without any intermediary, using a distributed order book. Every single aspect of the BasicSwap protocol is decentralized and open-source, so you don’t have to take our word for it; you can check the code yourself!</p><h2 id=\"list-of-compatible-coins\">List of Compatible Coins</h2><ul><li>Bitcoin</li><li>Monero</li><li>Particl</li><li>Litecoin</li><li>Namecoin</li></ul><p>We are looking at adding various coins, including ETH and its ERC-20 tokens, shortly after the release of the Open Beta. Any Bitcoin-based and Segwit enabled cryptocurrency can get integrated with minimal effort. Other token issuing blockchains like Fantom, Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, or Binance Smart Chain may become available on BasicSwap as well, at a later stage of the integration roadmap.</p><h2 id=\"key-features\">Key Features</h2><p>BasicSwap is a one-of-its-kind DEX in the blockchain industry. While it offers many benefits against centralized exchanges, it has three main distinguishing features that set it apart from other decentralized exchanges.</p><h3 id=\"distributed-order-books\">Distributed Order Books</h3><p>BasicSwap’s first version will focus on trading with an order book. Instead of swapping your coins into a liquidity pool (like on Uniswap, SushiSwap, or PancakeSwap), you can either place an order on the distributed order book (maker), at the price that you want, or take an order that has already been placed on there by other swappers (taker). In many ways, this makes BasicSwap more akin to the typical centralized exchanges most people are used to trading on, but with a totally decentralized and private twist.</p><p>Note that, unlike the vast majority of DEXs that offer order books, BasicSwap’s order book system is truly distributed and doesn’t introduce any form of centralization. No funny business here; BasicSwap makes it truly impossible, by design, for any third-party to have uncalled influence on the platform, and that's provably verifiable through code! The order book is powered by Particl’s own P2P network, <a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_mp_explained.html#the-securemessaging-smsg-protocol\">SMSG network</a>, which is the same network that powers <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\"><strong>Particl Marketplace</strong></a>.</p><p>The main benefit of having an order book system is that you can swap coins at the exact price that you want to swap them for. It also attracts more traditional market makers who may not want to provide liquidity to smart-contract based liquidity pools due to the risks of <a href=\"https://learn.bybit.com/investing/why-crypto-rug-pulls-happen-in-defi/\">rug pulls</a> and other theoretical exploits they carry.</p><p>But there’s more coming to BasicSwap! You can expect “quick swaps” to be deployed at some point in the future. As a matter of fact, this is already being looked into at the time of this writing! We will let you know more about it as soon (™) as we can!</p><h3 id=\"true-cross-chain-swaps\">True Cross-Chain Swaps</h3><p>Particl’s upcoming DEXs is a true cross-chain trading exchange. Unlike other DEX, BasicSwap does not mimic cross-chain interoperability. You’ll exchange one native coin for another one without any unsafe trickery!</p><p>You can swap one coin (i.e., Bitcoin) for one from another blockchain (i.e., Monero). And no, we’re not just talking about swapping coins between different Ethereum forks here (i.e., ETH to BSC). Moreover, BasicSwap doesn’t require coins to be wrapped into tokens of another chain (often Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or other similar chains).</p><h3 id=\"the-world-s-most-private-trading-exchange\">The World’s Most Private Trading Exchange</h3><p>To top it off, BasicSwap is inherently private. But what does that mean?! Well, it means a few things. For one, you won’t need to create an account, send documents, verify yourself, or limit your trading activities to arbitrary maximum daily restrictions. It’s open to all, without any restriction, and without any care about who you are or where you live.</p><p>That’s already a major improvement over centralized exchanges that have become way too curious, but you can take things even further! You can indeed massively increase your level of privacy by swapping any cryptocurrency for privacy coins like Particl or Monero, or by using them as a gateway to add a layer of privacy between two \"public coins\" (i.e,. Bitcoin and Litecoin). </p><p>Indeed, all Monero transactions are inherently private, and BasicSwap lets you swap PART using any of its privacy states; public, blind (<a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\">ConfidentialTransactions</a>), or anon (<a href=\"https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\">RingCT</a>). We’re planning on eventually enabling more private swap options through other privacy coins as well (i.e., Firo, Veil, etc).</p><p>But there is STILL more to come in regards to privacy! As we move forward and deploy the Taproot protocol on Particl, you can expect swaps of Bitcoin-style currencies to become indistinguishable from regular transactions. In other words, it will be eventually near-impossible to tell that, for example, a Bitcoin to Particl swap has occurred just by looking at their respective blockchains. That’s a major win for your financial privacy!</p><p>Indeed, enabling Taproot support is planned for a later stage of the Open Beta. That's one of the reasons why Particl's blockchain is always kept up-to-date with Bitcoin’s latest releases. It brings battle-hardened and reliable functionalities for your day-to-day financial sovereignty!</p><p>The combination of all these privacy-related features will make BasicSwap the world’s most private and unrestricted trading exchange, and that, in turn, will make you completely financially independent. Claim your sovereignty and live free...because, well, now you can!</p><h3 id=\"other-interesting-features\">Other Interesting Features</h3><p>There are a couple of other features that you may find interesting. As BasicSwap will become an important development focus moving forward, this list is expected to grow gradually.</p><ul><li>True Monero support</li><li>No account, sign up, or KYC</li><li>Incredibly low and competitive fees</li><li>User-friendly interface</li><li>No third-party, intermediary, or middleman at any point</li><li>Taproot compatible</li><li>Lightning Network compatible (in later versions)</li></ul><h2 id=\"what-about-monetization\">What About Monetization?</h2><p>As BasicSwap is entirely decentralized, no single party can earn profits from swaps made on the platform. That’d be very...centralized! But rest assured, we absolutely intend on turning Particl’s upcoming DEX into the spark that will cause the Particl project to go viral. Indeed, we are strongly confident that the DEX was the missing piece all along.</p><p>Indeed, it’s likely that a very small and competitive fee will be charged for using the DEX. But instead of having a third-party collecting them, it’s the entire Particl community who will benefit from them. All fees paid for using the DEX will be either converted into PART and burned, redistributed to stakers, or used as a liquidity incentive. A combination of these three strategies is likely to be what’s going to be deployed, although we haven’t finalized the strategy just yet and are still experimenting with different approaches.</p><p>In other words, we are working towards building BasicSwap in such a way that, as more people swap coins on the platform, the more demand there will be for the PART coin, the less available supply there will be, and the more valuable your staking rewards will be. And that’s just one application out of many others on the Particl ecosystem (Particl Marketplace has a similar dynamic as well).</p><p>Keep in mind that we want BasicSwap to provide an experience that has as little friction as possible. We also want any fee charged to remain very competitive with industry standards and, obviously, legally viable.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-it-compare\">How Does it Compare</h2><p>We know we know, there are many exchanges around, both centralized and decentralized. But we’re very confident that BasicSwap stands on its own and offers something quite unique.</p><p>In the interest of making it clear how BasicSwap differentiates itself from other trading platforms, here’s a brief breakdown of the differences with some of the other solutions around.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">Bittrex, Binance, Coinbase, etc.</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p> <strong>Compared to centralized exchanges...</strong>\n                        </br>\n                        </br>\n                            <li>You control your keys at any point in time</li>\n                            <li>You don't have to create an account or submit any document</li>\n                            <li>You don't need to verify yourself (KYC)</li>\n                            <li>There's no upper limit as to how much you can trade per period of time</li>\n                            <li>You remain private every step of the way</li>\n                            <li>There's no third-party, middleman, or intermediary involved at all</li>\n                        </p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck2\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck2\">Uniswap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, etc.</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p> <strong>Compared to “quick swap” exchanges with liquidity pools…</strong>\n                        <br>\n\n                        </br>\n                            <li>You can place or take orders on a distributed order book</li>\n                            <li>You swap your coins at the exact price that you want</li>\n                            <li>Swaps are truly cross-chain;

With BasicSwap, Particl becomes resilient against any exchange delisting and ensures the longevity of the project no matter what gets thrown at it. In other words, it makes Particl permanently unstoppable!</p><h3 id=\"promoting-and-supporting-financial-sovereignty\">Promoting and Supporting Financial Sovereignty</h3><p>At this time, with all of the promises and potential that cryptocurrencies yield, speculation is still their number one use case. Every day, billions upon billions worth of dollars in cryptocurrencies are traded on exchanges, both centralized and decentralized.</p><p>Furthermore, with the looming aggressive regulations that certain countries wish to impose on crypto, especially towards coins that protect your private life, centralized exchanges have been more and more restrictive while asking for more and more information about you and your funds. This locks several people out of trading cryptocurrencies in a practical matter and this problem is expected to accentuate as we move forward. Keep in mind, this is far from being a Particl-centric issue, but rather an industry-wide issue that’s impacting thousands if not millions of users, daily.</p><p>With this in mind, BasicSwap is a beacon of light in an environment that grows darker by the day for those who care about their financial sovereignty. By giving anyone the ability to easily swap cryptocurrencies from one chain to another, without any sort of restriction or overreaching requirements, it allows people to remain independent and keep their financial details to themselves.</p><p>As a matter of fact, never ever will BasicSwap ask you for any information or restrict you from using its services based on arbitrary rules such as who you are, where you live, or what your transaction history may look like; it’s entirely decentralized, autonomous, and open to all! This, alone, is bound to attract freedom lovers, giving the Particl project much deserved attention from this audience.</p><h3 id=\"exposure-for-the-project\">Exposure for the Project</h3><p>Because of how the Particl ecosystem and its distributed apps are all interconnected, we expect a non-negligible portion of BasicSwap users to start using other Particl apps and become Particl-wide users. That’s likely to accentuate much more as soon as the DEX gets integrated into Particl Desktop. After all, there’s much more to trading crypto, you’ve got to spend your gains as well! And, lo and behold, that’s precisely what Particl Marketplace lets you do (and you STILL stay completely private when doing so).</p><p>For this reason, BasicSwap is eventually going to become a major focus in terms of communications, marketing, PR, and outreach efforts, on the same level and as a complement to the marketplace.</p><p>That being said, the upcoming release of BasicSwap is a golden opportunity for Particl to become viral and become successful. Remember, billions upon billions worth of cryptocurrencies are traded every day, and BasicSwap’s unique set of features is bound to capture even just a tiny fraction of that pie.</p><p>Indeed, as the main use-case for cryptocurrencies is currently speculation, releasing a highly functional and one-of-a-kind cross-chain and private DEX is a major bid in that direction. We highly encourage you all to help us spread the good word about it to kick start its adoption. For all of us in the community, it’s sure going to bring a breath of fresh air to be able to market a new product other than the marketplace!</p><h3 id=\"easier-user-onboarding-for-particl-marketplace\">Easier User Onboarding for Particl Marketplace</h3><p>All payments on <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</a> are private. That's why you need to hold some PART coins in your \"anon balance\" to use it. The anon balance is where the coins that you own that are in the RingCT privacy state (<strong><a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_part_coin.html#privacy-specifications\">click here to learn more</a></strong>) are located.</p><p>And because all current PART exchanges (i.e., Bittrex, Probit, WizardSwap, etc.) work using public balances only, getting started with the marketplace requires new users to go through a few additional, manual steps to transfer coins from their public balance to the anon one. This has often been reported as a significant challenge to the marketplace's adoption, and BasicSwap provides a simple solution to that problem.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, BasicSwap lets you swap PART using the balance type of your choice. You can swap it against almost any other cryptocurrency, for example, Bitcoin, and use either your public, blind, or anon (marketplace-ready) balances to send or receive the PART. If you choose to swap the Bitcoin for PART using your anon balance, then as soon as the swap completes, you'll be ready to use the marketplace right away!</p><h3 id=\"increasing-demand-for-part-decreasing-supply-and-growing-staking-rewards\">Increasing Demand for PART, Decreasing Supply, and Growing Staking Rewards</h3><p>As you now know, we are looking into several monetization mechanisms to benefit the entire Particl ecosystem for the success of BasicSwap. Mind you, nothing is set in stone yet, but this includes mechanisms that would increase the demand for PART, reduce its circulating supply (<strong>burning coins</strong>), and introduce incentives for providing liquidity.</p><p>Of course, it’s very important to keep the costs of using the DEX as low as possible so that it remains competitive with other solutions. It’s also important to keep it as frictionless as possible because the easier it is to use, the more people will use it. We'll communicate to the community what monetization strategies will be deployed as early as we can!</p><h2 id=\"when-is-the-open-beta-going-live\">When is the Open Beta Going Live?</h2><p>Currently, BasicSwap is in closed beta and has been in a testing phase for several months now. An Open Beta, on mainnet and open to the public, is now just about to launch. While we cannot yet give an estimate on its launch date, we expect it to go live before the end of the year 2021 as a nice end-of-year present to the community. Keep in mind, that is not guaranteed and should not be considered any sort of official estimate; this is however what we’re hoping for.</p><h3 id=\"what-to-expect-from-the-open-beta\">What to Expect From the Open Beta?</h3><p>By any means, the Open Beta is not intended to be a finished product and will still very much be a beta product in beta phase. As such, you can expect a rough experience that isn’t all that much focused on user-friendliness. As its name implies, the “Open Beta” is intended to beta test the core features of the DEX and to ensure that the back-end works safely and as expected over a vast selection of environments and situations.</p><p>Here are a few notes of what you can expect from the upcoming Open Beta phase.</p><ul><li>Full mainnet functionality with swaps working with real coins</li><li>Compatibility with Bitcoin, Monero, Litecoin, Namecoin, and Particl. More coins will be added incrementally, especially around the time of the full release. We are already in touch with a few projects for integrations; the number of coins available on the DEX may grow rapidly once that becomes a bigger focus.</li><li>You will need to manually build the client following a set of instructions. There won’t be executables or one-click options to get started just yet, but rest assured that we have great solutions in the pipeline to simplify onboarding as much as possible.</li><li>A basic, barebone, and temporary user interface. The Open Beta won’t use, at least not to start with, any of the standalone or Particl Desktop mockups that we’ve shared in the past just yet. The Open Beta is for testers to test the back-end and technical features and is generally recommended for the more advanced types of users.</li><li>You will need to sync the blockchain of most of the coins you want to swap (excluding Monero, which you can simply sync to a public node). We plan on taking that requirement away in future versions of BasicSwap.</li><li>As with any beta software, you might encounter bugs or weird behaviors. Don’t worry, that’s why we’re doing an extensive Beta phase! So far, we are happy to confirm that, due to the safe and fail-proof nature of atomic swaps, we (including the closed beta group of testers) haven’t encountered any swap that failed and resulted in the loss of coins. Still, do keep in mind that it’s better to be safe than sorry and to ideally trade small amounts rather than large ones. It’s still early technology after all!</li></ul><p>Of course, that is not all. We have many surprises in the works which we intend on revealing soon (™). We are likely to add surprise features throughout the lifecycle of this Open Beta phase, so as we often say; stay tuned!</p><h3 id=\"what-s-left-to-do-before-the-open-beta-goes-live\">What’s Left to do Before the Open Beta Goes Live?</h3><p>As we rapidly near the release of the Open Beta, we’re checking off the last few items that remain on the to-do list. In reality, there isn’t much left to do as an insane amount of work has been silently going towards BasicSwap for several months now. Here are the last items needed to be completed before the Open Beta release.</p><ul><li>More testing and optimizations, notably related to the building and installation process.</li><li>Finish up the temporary UI for the Open Beta so that it’s easier to test.</li><li>Catching and fixing edge-case issues and other minor bugs.</li></ul><p>Once these items are completed, we’ll be ready to release the BasicSwap Open Beta to the public. We’ll clearly communicate, as soon as we can, when it will go live.</p><hr><p>As we’ve hopefully made clear by now, we have big plans for BasicSwap and strongly believe it can make Particl go viral and speed up the adoption and success of the entire Particl platform. Perhaps more importantly, it is a major play towards preserving everyone’s freedom and financial sovereignty. The benefits BasicSwap opens up to the cryptocurrency industry go much, much further than simply being helpful for the Particl community.</p><p>As such, we have a lot more planned than what we’ve mentioned in this blog post, but we obviously don’t want to play all of our cards yet. After all, the infamous “soon (™)” motto has to live on! ?</p><p>So, most definitely keep a keen eye on Particl News and look out for any update either in blog posts dedicated to BasicSwap or in our weekly development progress reports. You’re bound to be mesmerized!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

It’s a platform that hosts different apps that respect your rights, freedoms, and privacy without any compromise. While it’s still under heavy development, Particl aspires to become an all-inclusive and circular economy that people can use to opt-out of the current global financial system. In other words, it’s all about personal freedom and financial sovereignty.</p><p>In many ways, the ultimate vision of the platform can be compared as a sort of “decentralized and private WeChat-like ecosystem” where you can get all the key services or products you need right at your fingertips. Alternatively, you can also see it as an OS-like platform for distributed apps. In any case, Particl is an ecosystem of distributed apps, or “dapps”, where independence from any third-party or service provider is absolute. And BasicSwap is an incredibly important step towards that vision.</p><p>In fact, as the Particl ecosystem enables you to become truly financially independent, it’s easy to understand how an equally independent, resilient, and unstoppable way to buy and sell the platform’s native currency (PART) is required. However, at the time of this writing, PART is only available through centralized exchanges or by unprotected OTC deals between two people. While centralized exchanges (i.e., <a href=\"https://global.bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-PART\">Bittrex</a>, <a href=\"https://wizardswap.io/\">WizardSwap</a>) can provide many benefits and unique features, <strong>not having any decentralized option is not an option for a platform that seeks to be uncompromisingly independent</strong>. But that’s all about to change!</p><p>Now let’s dive deeper into BasicSwap and let’s see how it’s going to become a cornerstone for the entire Particl ecosystem. We'll also detail how it will become a competitive and vibrant trading platform for all cryptocurrencies that end up on it.</p><h2 id=\"the-basicswap-dex-explained\">The BasicSwap DEX Explained</h2><p>Keeping in mind that the Particl ecosystem is your gateway into a completely independent and autonomous economy, it’s vital to be able to acquire (and sell or trade) the platform’s native currency in an equally independent, safe, fast, and decentralized way. That’s precisely what the BasicSwap DEX enables you to do, but it doesn’t stop at just buying and selling PART.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 1000w, /glink/size/w1600/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 1600w, /glink/2021/11/Basicswap_GUI_standalone-1.png 1823w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption>Mockup of BasicSwap's UI | Work-in-progress that is subject to change</figcaption></figure><p>BasicSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol. It lets you swap one cryptocurrency for another from a different chain (cross-chain). It’s also private by nature. </p><p>Swaps are made directly person-to-person, without any intermediary, using a distributed order book. Every single aspect of the BasicSwap protocol is decentralized and open-source, so you don’t have to take our word for it; you can check the code yourself!</p><h2 id=\"list-of-compatible-coins\">List of Compatible Coins</h2><ul><li>Bitcoin</li><li>Monero</li><li>Particl</li><li>Litecoin</li><li>Namecoin</li></ul><p>We are looking at adding various coins, including ETH and its ERC-20 tokens, shortly after the release of the Open Beta. Any Bitcoin-based and Segwit enabled cryptocurrency can get integrated with minimal effort. Other token issuing blockchains like Fantom, Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, or Binance Smart Chain may become available on BasicSwap as well, at a later stage of the integration roadmap.</p><h2 id=\"key-features\">Key Features</h2><p>BasicSwap is a one-of-its-kind DEX in the blockchain industry. While it offers many benefits against centralized exchanges, it has three main distinguishing features that set it apart from other decentralized exchanges.</p><h3 id=\"distributed-order-books\">Distributed Order Books</h3><p>BasicSwap’s first version will focus on trading with an order book. Instead of swapping your coins into a liquidity pool (like on Uniswap, SushiSwap, or PancakeSwap), you can either place an order on the distributed order book (maker), at the price that you want, or take an order that has already been placed on there by other swappers (taker). In many ways, this makes BasicSwap more akin to the typical centralized exchanges most people are used to trading on, but with a totally decentralized and private twist.</p><p>Note that, unlike the vast majority of DEXs that offer order books, BasicSwap’s order book system is truly distributed and doesn’t introduce any form of centralization. No funny business here; BasicSwap makes it truly impossible, by design, for any third-party to have uncalled influence on the platform, and that's provably verifiable through code! The order book is powered by Particl’s own P2P network, <a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_mp_explained.html#the-securemessaging-smsg-protocol\">SMSG network</a>, which is the same network that powers <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\"><strong>Particl Marketplace</strong></a>.</p><p>The main benefit of having an order book system is that you can swap coins at the exact price that you want to swap them for. It also attracts more traditional market makers who may not want to provide liquidity to smart-contract based liquidity pools due to the risks of <a href=\"https://learn.bybit.com/investing/why-crypto-rug-pulls-happen-in-defi/\">rug pulls</a> and other theoretical exploits they carry.</p><p>But there’s more coming to BasicSwap! You can expect “quick swaps” to be deployed at some point in the future. As a matter of fact, this is already being looked into at the time of this writing! We will let you know more about it as soon (™) as we can!</p><h3 id=\"true-cross-chain-swaps\">True Cross-Chain Swaps</h3><p>Particl’s upcoming DEXs is a true cross-chain trading exchange. Unlike other DEX, BasicSwap does not mimic cross-chain interoperability. You’ll exchange one native coin for another one without any unsafe trickery!</p><p>You can swap one coin (i.e., Bitcoin) for one from another blockchain (i.e., Monero). And no, we’re not just talking about swapping coins between different Ethereum forks here (i.e., ETH to BSC). Moreover, BasicSwap doesn’t require coins to be wrapped into tokens of another chain (often Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or other similar chains).</p><h3 id=\"the-world-s-most-private-trading-exchange\">The World’s Most Private Trading Exchange</h3><p>To top it off, BasicSwap is inherently private. But what does that mean?! Well, it means a few things. For one, you won’t need to create an account, send documents, verify yourself, or limit your trading activities to arbitrary maximum daily restrictions. It’s open to all, without any restriction, and without any care about who you are or where you live.</p><p>That’s already a major improvement over centralized exchanges that have become way too curious, but you can take things even further! You can indeed massively increase your level of privacy by swapping any cryptocurrency for privacy coins like Particl or Monero, or by using them as a gateway to add a layer of privacy between two \"public coins\" (i.e,. Bitcoin and Litecoin). </p><p>Indeed, all Monero transactions are inherently private, and BasicSwap lets you swap PART using any of its privacy states; public, blind (<a href=\"https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation\">ConfidentialTransactions</a>), or anon (<a href=\"https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2019-07-05-audit-particl-bulletproof-mlsag/particl_audit_report.pdf\">RingCT</a>). We’re planning on eventually enabling more private swap options through other privacy coins as well (i.e., Firo, Veil, etc).</p><p>But there is STILL more to come in regards to privacy! As we move forward and deploy the Taproot protocol on Particl, you can expect swaps of Bitcoin-style currencies to become indistinguishable from regular transactions. In other words, it will be eventually near-impossible to tell that, for example, a Bitcoin to Particl swap has occurred just by looking at their respective blockchains. That’s a major win for your financial privacy!</p><p>Indeed, enabling Taproot support is planned for a later stage of the Open Beta. That's one of the reasons why Particl's blockchain is always kept up-to-date with Bitcoin’s latest releases. It brings battle-hardened and reliable functionalities for your day-to-day financial sovereignty!</p><p>The combination of all these privacy-related features will make BasicSwap the world’s most private and unrestricted trading exchange, and that, in turn, will make you completely financially independent. Claim your sovereignty and live free...because, well, now you can!</p><h3 id=\"other-interesting-features\">Other Interesting Features</h3><p>There are a couple of other features that you may find interesting. As BasicSwap will become an important development focus moving forward, this list is expected to grow gradually.</p><ul><li>True Monero support</li><li>No account, sign up, or KYC</li><li>Incredibly low and competitive fees</li><li>User-friendly interface</li><li>No third-party, intermediary, or middleman at any point</li><li>Taproot compatible</li><li>Lightning Network compatible (in later versions)</li></ul><h2 id=\"what-about-monetization\">What About Monetization?</h2><p>As BasicSwap is entirely decentralized, no single party can earn profits from swaps made on the platform. That’d be very...centralized! But rest assured, we absolutely intend on turning Particl’s upcoming DEX into the spark that will cause the Particl project to go viral. Indeed, we are strongly confident that the DEX was the missing piece all along.</p><p>Indeed, it’s likely that a very small and competitive fee will be charged for using the DEX. But instead of having a third-party collecting them, it’s the entire Particl community who will benefit from them. All fees paid for using the DEX will be either converted into PART and burned, redistributed to stakers, or used as a liquidity incentive. A combination of these three strategies is likely to be what’s going to be deployed, although we haven’t finalized the strategy just yet and are still experimenting with different approaches.</p><p>In other words, we are working towards building BasicSwap in such a way that, as more people swap coins on the platform, the more demand there will be for the PART coin, the less available supply there will be, and the more valuable your staking rewards will be. And that’s just one application out of many others on the Particl ecosystem (Particl Marketplace has a similar dynamic as well).</p><p>Keep in mind that we want BasicSwap to provide an experience that has as little friction as possible. We also want any fee charged to remain very competitive with industry standards and, obviously, legally viable.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-it-compare\">How Does it Compare</h2><p>We know we know, there are many exchanges around, both centralized and decentralized. But we’re very confident that BasicSwap stands on its own and offers something quite unique.</p><p>In the interest of making it clear how BasicSwap differentiates itself from other trading platforms, here’s a brief breakdown of the differences with some of the other solutions around.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center threethird\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col\">\n            <div class=\"tabs\">\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">Bittrex, Binance, Coinbase, etc.</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p> <strong>Compared to centralized exchanges...</strong>\n                        <br>\n                        <br>\n                            </p><li>You control your keys at any point in time</li>\n                            <li>You don't have to create an account or submit any document</li>\n                            <li>You don't need to verify yourself (KYC)</li>\n                            <li>There's no upper limit as to how much you can trade per period of time</li>\n                            <li>You remain private every step of the way</li>\n                            <li>There's no third-party, middleman, or intermediary involved at all</li>\n                        <p></p>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                        </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n                    </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n                </div><!-- tab close-->\n                <div class=\"tab\">\n                    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck2\">\n                    <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck2\">Uniswap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, etc.</label>\n                    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n                        <p> <strong>Compared to “quick swap” exchanges with liquidity pools…</strong>\n                        <br>\n\n                        <br>\n                            </p><li>You can place or take orders on a distributed order book</li>\n                            <li>You swap your coins at the exact price that you want</li>\n                            <li>Swaps are truly cross-chain;

With BasicSwap, Particl becomes resilient against any exchange delisting and ensures the longevity of the project no matter what gets thrown at it. In other words, it makes Particl permanently unstoppable!</p><h3 id=\"promoting-and-supporting-financial-sovereignty\">Promoting and Supporting Financial Sovereignty</h3><p>At this time, with all of the promises and potential that cryptocurrencies yield, speculation is still their number one use case. Every day, billions upon billions worth of dollars in cryptocurrencies are traded on exchanges, both centralized and decentralized.</p><p>Furthermore, with the looming aggressive regulations that certain countries wish to impose on crypto, especially towards coins that protect your private life, centralized exchanges have been more and more restrictive while asking for more and more information about you and your funds. This locks several people out of trading cryptocurrencies in a practical matter and this problem is expected to accentuate as we move forward. Keep in mind, this is far from being a Particl-centric issue, but rather an industry-wide issue that’s impacting thousands if not millions of users, daily.</p><p>With this in mind, BasicSwap is a beacon of light in an environment that grows darker by the day for those who care about their financial sovereignty. By giving anyone the ability to easily swap cryptocurrencies from one chain to another, without any sort of restriction or overreaching requirements, it allows people to remain independent and keep their financial details to themselves.</p><p>As a matter of fact, never ever will BasicSwap ask you for any information or restrict you from using its services based on arbitrary rules such as who you are, where you live, or what your transaction history may look like; it’s entirely decentralized, autonomous, and open to all! This, alone, is bound to attract freedom lovers, giving the Particl project much deserved attention from this audience.</p><h3 id=\"exposure-for-the-project\">Exposure for the Project</h3><p>Because of how the Particl ecosystem and its distributed apps are all interconnected, we expect a non-negligible portion of BasicSwap users to start using other Particl apps and become Particl-wide users. That’s likely to accentuate much more as soon as the DEX gets integrated into Particl Desktop. After all, there’s much more to trading crypto, you’ve got to spend your gains as well! And, lo and behold, that’s precisely what Particl Marketplace lets you do (and you STILL stay completely private when doing so).</p><p>For this reason, BasicSwap is eventually going to become a major focus in terms of communications, marketing, PR, and outreach efforts, on the same level and as a complement to the marketplace.</p><p>That being said, the upcoming release of BasicSwap is a golden opportunity for Particl to become viral and become successful. Remember, billions upon billions worth of cryptocurrencies are traded every day, and BasicSwap’s unique set of features is bound to capture even just a tiny fraction of that pie.</p><p>Indeed, as the main use-case for cryptocurrencies is currently speculation, releasing a highly functional and one-of-a-kind cross-chain and private DEX is a major bid in that direction. We highly encourage you all to help us spread the good word about it to kick start its adoption. For all of us in the community, it’s sure going to bring a breath of fresh air to be able to market a new product other than the marketplace!</p><h3 id=\"easier-user-onboarding-for-particl-marketplace\">Easier User Onboarding for Particl Marketplace</h3><p>All payments on <a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</a> are private. That's why you need to hold some PART coins in your \"anon balance\" to use it. The anon balance is where the coins that you own that are in the RingCT privacy state (<strong><a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/in-depth/indepth_part_coin.html#privacy-specifications\">click here to learn more</a></strong>) are located.</p><p>And because all current PART exchanges (i.e., Bittrex, Probit, WizardSwap, etc.) work using public balances only, getting started with the marketplace requires new users to go through a few additional, manual steps to transfer coins from their public balance to the anon one. This has often been reported as a significant challenge to the marketplace's adoption, and BasicSwap provides a simple solution to that problem.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, BasicSwap lets you swap PART using the balance type of your choice. You can swap it against almost any other cryptocurrency, for example, Bitcoin, and use either your public, blind, or anon (marketplace-ready) balances to send or receive the PART. If you choose to swap the Bitcoin for PART using your anon balance, then as soon as the swap completes, you'll be ready to use the marketplace right away!</p><h3 id=\"increasing-demand-for-part-decreasing-supply-and-growing-staking-rewards\">Increasing Demand for PART, Decreasing Supply, and Growing Staking Rewards</h3><p>As you now know, we are looking into several monetization mechanisms to benefit the entire Particl ecosystem for the success of BasicSwap. Mind you, nothing is set in stone yet, but this includes mechanisms that would increase the demand for PART, reduce its circulating supply (<strong>burning coins</strong>), and introduce incentives for providing liquidity.</p><p>Of course, it’s very important to keep the costs of using the DEX as low as possible so that it remains competitive with other solutions. It’s also important to keep it as frictionless as possible because the easier it is to use, the more people will use it. We'll communicate to the community what monetization strategies will be deployed as early as we can!</p><h2 id=\"when-is-the-open-beta-going-live\">When is the Open Beta Going Live?</h2><p>Currently, BasicSwap is in closed beta and has been in a testing phase for several months now. An Open Beta, on mainnet and open to the public, is now just about to launch. While we cannot yet give an estimate on its launch date, we expect it to go live before the end of the year 2021 as a nice end-of-year present to the community. Keep in mind, that is not guaranteed and should not be considered any sort of official estimate; this is however what we’re hoping for.</p><h3 id=\"what-to-expect-from-the-open-beta\">What to Expect From the Open Beta?</h3><p>By any means, the Open Beta is not intended to be a finished product and will still very much be a beta product in beta phase. As such, you can expect a rough experience that isn’t all that much focused on user-friendliness. As its name implies, the “Open Beta” is intended to beta test the core features of the DEX and to ensure that the back-end works safely and as expected over a vast selection of environments and situations.</p><p>Here are a few notes of what you can expect from the upcoming Open Beta phase.</p><ul><li>Full mainnet functionality with swaps working with real coins</li><li>Compatibility with Bitcoin, Monero, Litecoin, Namecoin, and Particl. More coins will be added incrementally, especially around the time of the full release. We are already in touch with a few projects for integrations; the number of coins available on the DEX may grow rapidly once that becomes a bigger focus.</li><li>You will need to manually build the client following a set of instructions. There won’t be executables or one-click options to get started just yet, but rest assured that we have great solutions in the pipeline to simplify onboarding as much as possible.</li><li>A basic, barebone, and temporary user interface. The Open Beta won’t use, at least not to start with, any of the standalone or Particl Desktop mockups that we’ve shared in the past just yet. The Open Beta is for testers to test the back-end and technical features and is generally recommended for the more advanced types of users.</li><li>You will need to sync the blockchain of most of the coins you want to swap (excluding Monero, which you can simply sync to a public node). We plan on taking that requirement away in future versions of BasicSwap.</li><li>As with any beta software, you might encounter bugs or weird behaviors. Don’t worry, that’s why we’re doing an extensive Beta phase! So far, we are happy to confirm that, due to the safe and fail-proof nature of atomic swaps, we (including the closed beta group of testers) haven’t encountered any swap that failed and resulted in the loss of coins. Still, do keep in mind that it’s better to be safe than sorry and to ideally trade small amounts rather than large ones. It’s still early technology after all!</li></ul><p>Of course, that is not all. We have many surprises in the works which we intend on revealing soon (™). We are likely to add surprise features throughout the lifecycle of this Open Beta phase, so as we often say; stay tuned!</p><h3 id=\"what-s-left-to-do-before-the-open-beta-goes-live\">What’s Left to do Before the Open Beta Goes Live?</h3><p>As we rapidly near the release of the Open Beta, we’re checking off the last few items that remain on the to-do list. In reality, there isn’t much left to do as an insane amount of work has been silently going towards BasicSwap for several months now. Here are the last items needed to be completed before the Open Beta release.</p><ul><li>More testing and optimizations, notably related to the building and installation process.</li><li>Finish up the temporary UI for the Open Beta so that it’s easier to test.</li><li>Catching and fixing edge-case issues and other minor bugs.</li></ul><p>Once these items are completed, we’ll be ready to release the BasicSwap Open Beta to the public. We’ll clearly communicate, as soon as we can, when it will go live.</p><hr><p>As we’ve hopefully made clear by now, we have big plans for BasicSwap and strongly believe it can make Particl go viral and speed up the adoption and success of the entire Particl platform. Perhaps more importantly, it is a major play towards preserving everyone’s freedom and financial sovereignty.

So, without further ado, the time for the weekly\nstatus report has come. This week has been a continuation of the work reported\nin the past few progress reports. \n\nOn the side of Particl Desktop, there's not much new stuff that stands out other\nthan the previously mentioned items seeing some progress. As usual, a few minor\nbugs and improvements, as reported by community members, have been fixed and\nwill be included in the next version of Particl Desktop (3.1). Thanks to all of\nour dedicated community members that are still reporting issues and making\nsuggestions to this day; it's incredibly useful and has a big impact on the\nquality of the product!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Development Progress\nHere's a short list of the current items being worked on or planned on being\nworked on in the short term. \n\nPlease note that these items are part of the immediate priority the team has set\nup following the release of Particl V3 on mainnet. They are meant to support the\nmainnet release by making its foundation better. While they may appear minor,\nthey are vital to different types of users and will go a long way in making\nParticl Marketplace more usable in the immediate.\n\nAny new major feature or function is planned for Particl Desktop 3.2 and\nsubsequent versions.\n\n * Several features related to better vendor inventory import/update. We can\n   report that the ability to batch update prices to multiple listings at once\n   is mostly completed, with only UI tweaks and additional testing being\n   required. The addition of a product code and the ability to import images\n   directly through the CSV file directly is still in progress and is expected\n   to be wrapped up next week, if all goes well. \n * The usage of markdown in product descriptions on the marketplace for better,\n   more customizable formatting. This task has already been started but has been\n   put on pause until the above items are completed. It is estimated that this\n   item will be completed very quickly once its development resumes.\n * Enable the sale of digital items with no physical shipping address\n   requirement (i.e., download links, NFTs, user codes, etc.). This task has not\n   been started yet.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Core Development Progress\nParticl's core developer, Tecnovert, has spent the vast majority of the week\ntesting the upcoming BasicSwap DEX and fixing various small issues. We are happy\nto report that the protocol is now pretty stable but still requires testing as\nthe upcoming open beta will be over mainnet (meaning you'll be able to swap\n\"real coins\"). That's why it needs to be as secure as possible and cater to any\npotential weird case.\n\nOn that note, the GUI for the open beta is currently under work and will be\nmoved as a top priority starting on Monday next week. Please keep in mind that\nthe GUI for the open beta is not at all how we intend it to be on the date of\nthe official release; it's merely so that you can test the bare protocol is a\nmore user-friendly way.\n\nWe've mentioned it in the past, but it's worth repeating; we've got many\nsurprises planned for BasicSwap and have a big strategic vision for it. While we\nhaven't released too much information about it, or on how we plan on leveraging\nit to make Particl go viral, but we do not want to play our cards too early for\nmany reasons.\n\nAs we make solid progress on the upcoming DEX every week and check more and more\nitems off of its to-do list, we near its official announcement and the reveal of\nmuch key information regarding it. We can't wait to share those with you and\nwe're absolutely thrilled with the direction it's taking. Stay tuned for more\ninformation, it's coming shortly!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks everybody for your support and passion. Particl is a long-term project\nwith a bold but very precise vision. We're absolutely blessed to have such a\ndedicated community tagging along for the ride and that understands what this\nproject is working to achieve.\n\nWe wish you all a great weekend, we'll see you on Monday!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
