We know, this sounds...weird\nand vague, but the 2016 American presidential election is, as we’ll see, a\nfantastic example of this often-overlooked phenomenon associated with data\nmining.\n\nThe lessons we can learn from the Cambridge Analytica \"scandal\"\nNovember 2016 saw the election of a highly polarizing figure to the American\npresidency: Donald J. Trump. Whether one’s opinion on the man is negative or\npositive, there is a good chance that it is not neutral.\n\nIn 2016, Trump’s presidential campaign contracted Cambridge Analytica\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica], a big data firm that\nspecialized in analyzing data and selling the conclusions of their research to\ninterested parties, to help craft them narratives and political strategies.\nCambridge Analytica, on their “about” web page, touted an impressive 5000 data\npoints per person, targeting 220 million Americans\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20160216023554/https://cambridgeanalytica.org/about]\n, and used that data to create personality models for those people. That\ninformation, if you could afford it, was highly valuable to the Trump campaign’s\nambitions – and with the help of Cambridge Analytica, they gathered as much\ninformation on American voters as they possibly could. What do they like, or\nfear? What are the biggest issues? What triggers in them the most emotion? Who\ndo they talk to? Where do they hang out? What is the best way to catch their\nattention? The list was extensive\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html]\n.\n\nAs it turned out, even when people disliked Trump, they talked about him a lot,\nand often on social media. This created intense debates of ideas, creating the\nconditions for all the data Cambridge Analytica needed to advise the Trump\ncampaign on how to best move forward. Simply talking about him on social media\nis very likely to have contributed to his unexpected 306-to-232 victory.\n\nIt’s clear in hindsight that our discourse allowed Cambridge to craft very apt\npolitical narratives in order to appeal to a large part of the population –\noften alienated from common politicians - and provided all the information\nrequired to draft an election strategy. Ironically, the polemic around Trump –\nhow controversial he was as a political figure – directly contributed to his\nvictory. In the end, for slightly more than half of American voters, their data\nwas in effect used against them.\n\nAn institutional problem\nBut here’s the real cherry on top: every single political party, on either side\nof the aisle, every corporation, think tank, research firm, every special\ninterest group - they are all guilty of the exact same thing the Trump campaign\ndid with Cambridge Analytica. They all do it, almost without exception – the\nstakes are too high not to, and the bottom lines too attractive.\n\nAnd so, whenever you log online and discuss with others, do research, scroll up\nor down and spend X amount of seconds on this or that social media post, you\ngenerate data that not only could leak and expose you to malicious actors, but\nalso be used to profile and track you, and often against your own interests.\n\nIf you’re an online vendor, for example, then it’s your sales volume and page\ntraffic that will be collected sometimes by competitors, other times by the\neCommerce platform you’re using. And this valuable data can then be used to put\nyou out of business.\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/] \nIt happened, it still happens, and it’ll keep happening. In fact, the problem of\nyour data being used against you go far beyond politics and can reach every\nsingle aspect of your life. It probably already did and you may not even be\naware of; how could you in the first place?\n\nSo how do we stop this? How do we protect our digital sovereignty and opt out of\nthis toxic dynamic?\n\nUnfortunately, it seems impossible if you use traditional web technologies, or\nwhat is increasingly being referred to as “web2”. With cookies, data sharing\npolicies, and monetization, there’s little to no way to escape from this. It’s\nfor “advertisement purposes”, they say. But we all certainly know better!\n\nFor example, what if you want to buy something online? Then you have to go on a\nwebsite that uses various plugins and third-party services. The most obvious\nbeing a payment processor and/or bank, a domain host, a website/server host, a\nweb platform (i.e., Wordpress and its plugins), an e-commerce solution (Amazon,\neBay, Shopify), etc. All of these third-parties collect their own set of data,\naccording to what they want to know about you (and how much they plan on\nmonetize your information), and then, they share it to even more partners that,\nin turn, monetize your data and probably share it with their own partners as\nwell. A simple purchase on Amazon spreads your personal information in all\ndirections with absolutely no control or consent on your end (and as we’ve seen, \nagreeing to pop up privacy and cookie policies does a poor job at slowing this\ndata pandemic down\n[https://particl.news/gdpr-and-consent-based-privacy-regulations-flaws/]]).\n\nGiven time, every problem finds its solution\nThis state of affairs was a big motivation behind our development of the \nParticl\nMarketplace [https://particl.io/marketplace] - a decentralized, peer-to-peer\nmarketplace with no middleman and no data collection whatsoever.

Calling it the world’s safest and most private way to buy and\nsell anything online is no exaggeration because if no data is generated in the\nfirst place, then it can’t be collected. And that’s precisely how we roll!\n\nWith the state of the internet today, it is high time we get back to being\nskeptical and careful about who we share our data with; it’s never been as much\nof a problem as it is now and one would be ill-advised to think this will get\nbetter on its own, without us taking the appropriate steps required to protect\nourselves.

It promised us, the people, a level of financial and\neconomic freedom truly never seen before.\n\nBut is Bitcoin really enough, and can it survive the onslaught of government\nregulations and control coming its way? The answer is nuanced and more complex\nthan most like to admit.\n\nThe Worrying Reality of Financial Spying\nAs we've seen in previous Particl stories (1\n[https://particl.news/the-internet-is-centralized-that-spells-trouble-for-all-of-us/]\n, 2 [https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/], 3\n[https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/]), the web is\nundergoing a worrying trend of centralization and data consumption abuse. Every\nday, online services that you use collect more and more data about yourself so\nthat they can be used, shared, and monetized by corporations - generally\nwithout\nyour informed consent\n[https://particl.news/gdpr-and-consent-based-privacy-regulations-flaws/]. That\ndata is disseminated to all sorts of interested parties, going from corporations\nto governments, all the way to politically motivated groups who would like to\nuse it against you or for their own motives.\n\nIt is now common knowledge that governments around the world track our financial\nlife. With collaboration from the banks and payment service companies, many\ngovernments can, at any time, request any level of financial information about\nyou. And while a lot of us may not have anything particularly nefarious to hide,\nit still impacts and involves us in very concrete ways! Let's look at a very\nrecent example illustrating perfectly the risks associated with traceable\nfinancial data.\n\nBe Careful How You Partake in Politics - Or You'll Get the Stick\nYou've probably heard of the \"trucker protests\" that unfolded earlier this year;\nstarted in Canada, these anti-mandate, anti-lockdown protests subsequently\ninspired other similar convoys in other countries. This protest turned into a\nbig political arm-wrestling match, with both sides of the political spectrum\nframing them either as a prime example of peaceful demonstration or as an\nirresponsible demonstration of carelessness sometimes nearing terrorism.\n\nAnd as any major political and partisan event these days unfolds, the internet\nlit up and both sides mobilized to try and ridicule or destroy the other side.\n\nMobilizing many individuals for such an extended period of time takes funds, and\nthose funds typically come in the form of donations. Thousands of people all\naround the world donated to the trucker movement, only for GoFundMe to block\nthe\nfundraising and threaten to redirect the funds to charities of their choosing\n[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gofundme-freedom-convoy-under-investigation-for-blocking-donations-canadian-truckers/] \n(which, under pressure, they opted against in favor of reimbursing people). In\nresponse, pro-convoy members of the public started using a little known yet more\nopen donation service: GiveSendGo.\n\nGiveSendGo advertised itself as a free (as in freedom) donation service that\nwould support the movement and not interfere with the donations. But it wasn’t\nto be: a few days after donations started to flock in, the website was exploited\nand hacked, which led to the \"doxing\" of thousands of donors\n[https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/14/freedom-convoy-donor-leak-givesendgo/]. Their\nnames, email addresses, ZIP codes, and IP addresses were made public. The\nhorror! And in such a politically charged climate, one can imagine the potential\nimpact such a leak could have on the private lives of people who donated to the\ntrucker convoy.\n\nNo matter one's political opinion on this two-fold example, truth is that the\nissue it highlights is relevant to almost any heated topic, be it political or\nnot. Financial privacy is of utmost importance in a day and age where data can\nbe weaponized. \n\nThis tells us is that the web sorely needs to improve on two things when it\ncomes to digital payments. One, there is a need for payments to go truly digital\nand trustless so that they can't be frozen, reversed, or blocked. And two, there\nis a clear and broad need for some payments to be accomplished anonymously to\nprotect the personal and financial data of those making transactions.\n\nAnd then came Bitcoin\nBitcoin, the father of cryptocurrencies, offered us half of the solution: a\nrevolutionary method of payment that could not be seized, frozen, reversed, or\nblocked.\n\nUnfortunately, we’ve seen some very concerning events unfold in just the past\nfew weeks – from Ethereum service provider Infura and Metamask freezing crypto\naccounts\n[https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/03/metamask-infura-block-certain-areas-amid-crypto-sanctions-fury/]\n, to the so-called decentralized marketplace OpenSea blocking off users from\ntheir assets on the basis on their Russian nationality\n[https://medium.com/coinmonks/as-metamask-and-opensea-abide-by-us-sanctions-the-russian-ban-is-in-the-spotlight-67611df121f8]\n. This all boils down to cryptocurrency users too often depending on centralized\nentities.\n\nBitcoin and cryptocurrencies are still providing all the freedom they set out to\nprovide; but if you use third-party services, you in effect forfeit true\nownership of your coins and go back to the old patterns of not owning your\nmoney. Pro-tip: Always use non-custodial wallets and be very careful which\nservice you send your coins to!\n\nA question however remains: how did these companies know the identity and\nnationality of the owners of certain crypto addresses in the first place?\n\nBitcoin: Often Anything but Anonymous\nIn a day and age where financial data is worth gold, Bitcoin suffers from a\nterrible Achille's heel: all transactions are transparent and publicly displayed\non an open ledger, and all the financial data of its holders in effect become\navailable information. And that's becoming increasingly worrying as blockchain\ntracing firms and crypto service providers are now in possession of very\ninvasive and effective technology to trace Bitcoin payments.\n\nTo illustrate the sad reality of today's Bitcoin, see it this way. How would you\nfeel walking down the street, with a picture of your bank account and credit\ncard(s) balances stamped on your forehead? Anyone that walks past you and that\nis curious enough to look up would see exactly how much you own and in which\naccount. They would also be able to see exactly with who you’ve transacted since\nyou opened your accounts. They could see exactly what you bought, what you\ninvested in, how much you donated to whom, a full and precise picture of your\nrevenue and savings, and so on. Clearly, no one in their right mind would do\nthis.\n\nIn many cases, this is precisely what Bitcoin does to your financial information\nnow. With all the tracing tech around, combined with the need to KYC yourself to\nuse almost any exchange or service provider, anyone curious enough can simply\nquery the publicly available information, draft a provably accurate and very\nprecise picture of your finances, and know exactly who's financial profile that\nis.\n\nThe array of people that can now know this information extends from governments\nand banks, to almost any corporation or private individual. A notable \"step\ndown\" from the traditional financial system when it comes to financial privacy.\n\nA Good Crypto is a Private Crypto\nAs great as Bitcoin sounds, it is having a hard time realizing its initial\nvision - even after 14 years of existence - precisely because of those privacy\nissues. Luckily, it's not the only digital currency around.\n\nWe've seen a few cryptocurrencies focus solely on this issue of privacy, making\nthem very good candidates to be considered as true alternatives to cash and as\ngreat settlement layers for the web of today and tomorrow.\n\nAmongst them there is Monero, which uses the very solid RingCT privacy protocol,\nor Firo with its more exotic privacy setup. We also have Zcash, a very\nwell-known privacy coin - and many others. Each of them presents a different\ntwist to the angle of privacy and comes with different codebases, strengths, and\nlimitations.\n\nBut privacy generally comes with concessions in flexibility. While the examples\nmentioned above are great alternatives to Bitcoin because of the privacy they\nprovide, their use-case is pretty much limited to person-to-person currency\ntransactions. And although they accomplish their purpose well, a lot of\npotentials is left unexploited, especially as we've seen, in recent years, the\nadvent of \"dapps\" (distributed applications) and of Web3, a new \"take\" on the\nweb that promises data ownership and to do away with centralized parties.\n\nBecause of the limitations of privacy coins, they, unfortunately, cannot be used\nin any Dapp or be an important part of Web3. And in reality, all the promises of\nWeb3 are more or less moot if its settlement layer is not private. They will\nfall prey to the same issues mentioned earlier in this article - whether it is\nWeb2 or Web3.\n\nA Modern Privacy Coin Fills That Gap\nThat is what motivated us to build PART [https://particl.io/coin]. It is a\nmodern privacy coin that uses the most battle-tested codebase, Bitcoin, and the\nmost battle-tested privacy protocol, RingCT (the same privacy protocol used by\nMonero). But unlike other privacy coins, PART [https://particl.io/coin] is built\nwith flexibility in mind, so that it can be used in Dapps and on Web3. Case in\npoint: PART is currently the default settlement layer of Particl Marketplace\n[https://particl.io/marketplace], a decentralized and private eBay-like\nmarketplace, where one can buy and sell anything without fees, middlemen, or\nrestrictions.\n\nBy leveraging the flexible Bitcoin codebase and adding to it solid privacy\ntechnologies, PART succeeds in fixing Bitcoin's biggest problem of financial\nspying, all the while being available for use as settlement for this new wave of\nWeb3 applications. It’s basically getting the cake and eating it too.\n\nAnd to add more merit to it, we've designed it in a way to be fully compatible\nwith the Lightning Network - meaning any scalability or high fee concern that\none might have with privacy coins is completely a thing of the past. PART is\nindeed completely private, almost infinitely scalable, and near-free to\ntransact.\n\nWith PART [https://particl.io/coin], we intend to give you full absolute control\nover your money in a way that's safe and future-proof. We are excited to move\nforward and keep on innovating within the Web3 space with tech that keeps you\nand your information safe from prying eyes.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf that sounds great to you, then we encourage you to learn more about PART\n[https://particl.io/coin]'s cryptocurrency and the suite of Web3 applications\nwe're building (marketplace, DEX, messaging app, etc) here [https://particl.io/]\n, and join our awesome and motivated global community on Telegram\n[https://t.me/particlOn], Element\n[https://riot.im/app/#/room/#particl:matrix.org] or Discord\n[https://discord.me/particl]!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJoin the discussion\nWhat's your stance?

The answer is nuanced and more complex than most like to admit.</p><h2 id=\"the-worrying-reality-of-financial-spying\">The Worrying Reality of Financial Spying</h2><p>As we've seen in previous Particl stories (<a href=\"https://particl.news/the-internet-is-centralized-that-spells-trouble-for-all-of-us/\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/\">3</a>), the web is undergoing a worrying trend of centralization and data consumption abuse. Every day, online services that you use collect more and more data about yourself so that they can be used, shared, and monetized by corporations - <a href=\"https://particl.news/gdpr-and-consent-based-privacy-regulations-flaws/\">generally without your informed consent</a>. That data is disseminated to all sorts of interested parties, going from corporations to governments, all the way to politically motivated groups who would like to use it against you or for their own motives.</p><p>It is now common knowledge that governments around the world track our financial life. With collaboration from the banks and payment service companies, many governments can, at any time, request any level of financial information about you. And while a lot of us may not have anything particularly nefarious to hide, it still impacts and involves us in very concrete ways! Let's look at a very recent example illustrating perfectly the risks associated with traceable financial data.</p><h2 id=\"be-careful-how-you-partake-in-politics-or-you-ll-get-the-stick\">Be Careful How You Partake in Politics - Or You'll Get the Stick</h2><p>You've probably heard of the \"trucker protests\" that unfolded earlier this year; started in Canada, these anti-mandate, anti-lockdown protests subsequently inspired other similar convoys in other countries. This protest turned into a big political arm-wrestling match, with both sides of the political spectrum framing them either as a prime example of peaceful demonstration or as an irresponsible demonstration of carelessness sometimes nearing terrorism.</p><p>And as any major political and partisan event these days unfolds, the internet lit up and both sides mobilized to try and ridicule or destroy the other side.</p><p>Mobilizing many individuals for such an extended period of time takes funds, and those funds typically come in the form of donations. Thousands of people all around the world donated to the trucker movement, only for GoFundMe to <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gofundme-freedom-convoy-under-investigation-for-blocking-donations-canadian-truckers/\">block the fundraising and threaten to redirect the funds to charities of their choosing</a> (which, under pressure, they opted against in favor of reimbursing people). In response, pro-convoy members of the public started using a little known yet more open donation service: GiveSendGo.</p><p>GiveSendGo advertised itself as a free (as in freedom) donation service that would support the movement and not interfere with the donations. But it wasn’t to be: a few days after donations started to flock in, the website was exploited and hacked, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/14/freedom-convoy-donor-leak-givesendgo/\">led to the \"doxing\" of thousands of donors</a>. Their names, email addresses, ZIP codes, and IP addresses were made public. The horror! And in such a politically charged climate, one can imagine the potential impact such a leak could have on the private lives of people who donated to the trucker convoy.</p><p>No matter one's political opinion on this two-fold example, truth is that the issue it highlights is relevant to almost any heated topic, be it political or not. Financial privacy is of utmost importance in a day and age where data can be weaponized. </p><p>This tells us is that the web sorely needs to improve on two things when it comes to digital payments. One, there is a need for payments to go truly digital and trustless so that they can't be frozen, reversed, or blocked. And two, there is a clear and broad need for some payments to be accomplished anonymously to protect the personal and financial data of those making transactions.</p><h2 id=\"and-then-came-bitcoin\">And then came Bitcoin</h2><p>Bitcoin, the father of cryptocurrencies, offered us half of the solution: a revolutionary method of payment that could not be seized, frozen, reversed, or blocked.</p><p>Unfortunately, we’ve seen some very concerning events unfold in just the past few weeks – from <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/03/metamask-infura-block-certain-areas-amid-crypto-sanctions-fury/\">Ethereum service provider Infura and Metamask freezing crypto accounts</a>, to <a href=\"https://medium.com/coinmonks/as-metamask-and-opensea-abide-by-us-sanctions-the-russian-ban-is-in-the-spotlight-67611df121f8\">the so-called decentralized marketplace OpenSea blocking off users from their assets on the basis on their Russian nationality</a>.

anonymity in\ncryptocurrencies and decentralized systems, we share our thoughts on the purpose\nof privacy in decentralized eCommerce platforms, specifically with regards to\nprotecting user safety and data sovereignty.\n\nA Brief Reminder of Bitcoin’s History\nNearly two decades ago, Bitcoin was introduced as a digital currency aiming to\nprovide financial freedom and personal sovereignty globally, irrespective of\none's background or circumstances.\n\nAnd while it spawned an incredible revolution, both in technological progress\nand online discourse, the proposed solution unfortunately fell short of\naccomplishing its stated mission.\n\nAn Unfortunate Reality\nContrary to early assumptions, Bitcoin transactions are far from private. In\nfact, they often fare worse than traditional fiat currencies in preserving\nfinancial confidentiality. Indeed, fiat systems typically handle fund transfers\nthrough secured channels designed to safeguard users' financial data from\nunauthorized public exposure.\n\nIn stark contrast, all Bitcoin transactions are permanently recorded on a public\nledger, openly exposing the entirety of one's financial details to any curious\nobserver. While Bitcoin's pseudonymous nature may foster a sense of anonymity in\nlimited contexts, this perception is increasingly recognized as a dangerous\nillusion.\n\nIn fact, transaction tracing capabilities have advanced significantly in the\npast few years, driven in part by regulatory requirements like\nKnow-Your-Customer (KYC) compliance that have necessitated increased transaction\nmonitoring by financial services.\n\nHistorically, only regulatory bodies and financial institutions had access to\ndetailed reports of users' on-chain financial histories through partnerships\nwith blockchain analytics firms however, the ability to effectively deanonymize\ntransactions and map them to real-world identities is rapidly proliferating to\nnew actors — most concerningly, criminals, hackers, and other malicious entities\nintent on exploiting this data for financial gain at the expense of unsuspecting\nvictims — thanks to the rapid evolution of large language models and artificial\nintelligence that have spawned widely accessible tracing protocols.\n\nThese escalating privacy vulnerabilities underscore the paramount importance of\ndeveloping robust privacy-preserving solutions for cryptocurrencies across the\nglobe, such as, among others, ”privacy coins”. Maintaining financial\nconfidentiality is not merely a luxury but an essential capability to safeguard\nusers operating in these systems.\n\nBitcoin and eCommerce\nHowever, when it comes to decentralized commerce – the logical evolution beyond\ndecentralized currencies – merely utilizing privacy coins is not sufficient.\nWhile on-chain transactions may be inherently private, the platforms\nfacilitating purchases and sales represent another significant attack vector\nthat must be addressed.\n\nAs regulatory obligations evolve, businesses operating centralized\ncryptocurrency platforms may be compelled to collect extensive user information,\nincluding transaction histories, associated identities, IP addresses, shipping\ndetails from buyers, sales data from sellers, and more. While one could\nreasonably expect regulatory bodies to handle such information responsibly, the\nsame assurances cannot be extended to the platforms themselves, as highlighted\nin our previous articles on the imperatives of privacy here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/] \nand here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-the-need-to-own-your-data-19bc31b0ec74/]\n.\n\nBut even if all platforms always acted in good faith, this centralized\naggregation of sensitive data becomes an enticing target for hackers and other\nmalicious actors seeking to exploit personal and financial information for\nillicit gains.\n\nThe Inherent Safety Risks of DeCommerce\nThe logical solution, therefore, is to develop an eCommerce platform that is as\ndecentralized as cryptocurrencies themselves. Such a platform would operate in a\npurely peer-to-peer manner, built upon a truly decentralized architecture devoid\nof single points of failure or centralized components. The objective is to offer\nservices akin to centralized eCommerce giants like eBay or Amazon, but without\nany central entity, thus eliminating the associated costs, fees, and frictions\ninherent to intermediaries. A \"decentralized online marketplace\", embodying\nBitcoin's ethos, and providing a clear user experience improvement over\ncentralized counterparts without data collection.\n\nHowever, while recent advancements in blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies\nenable such decentralized eCommerce platforms, they also introduce new\nchallenges in preserving users' financial data privacy and safety.\n\nPicture this scenario: You open a decentralized marketplace, hoping to purchase\na new computer online. You browse available listings from sellers worldwide and\nfind a suitable item. You proceed to add it to your cart and checkout, providing\nthe seller with your shipping address. Herein lies a significant safety concern;\nif you've paid using pseudonymous cryptocurrencies, you've likely revealed your\nphysical location alongside your entire financial history, including balances\nand past transactions.\n\nIn most cases, such disclosures may be innocuous, however, over an extended\nperiod, you or someone else may inadvertently expose critical details to\nmalicious actors, which could be used to identify and target the potential\nvictim. This risk vector is particularly concerning for high net-worth\nindividuals, as every purchase they make could effectively paint a target on\ntheir backs, making this situation simply unsustainable.\n\nCentralized platforms like eBay or Amazon typically circumvent this issue, as\npayments are facilitated through highly regulated centralized providers like\nPayPal, among others. While these entities face valid criticisms, they at least\navoid exposing users' complete financial histories on pseudonymous ledgers.\n\nHowever, a decentralized platform, by its very nature, does not rely on payment\nprocessors. Instead, it enables direct peer-to-peer trade between buyers and\nsellers. Consequently, an alternative solution must be implemented to preserve\nusers' financial privacy and security.\n\nThe Need for Privacy in DeCommerce\nParticl Marketplace addresses these concerns with its decentralized and secure\nonline marketplace, often touted as a privacy-first eCommerce solution. It\nensures user safety by providing robust privacy safeguards in two critical\nareas.\n\nTransactional Privacy\nFirst, it facilitates complete transactional privacy for counterparties through\nthe use of PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, which integrates advanced\non-chain privacy protocols. Two specific protocols are instrumental in\npreserving financial confidentiality: Confidential Transactions (\"CT\") and ring\nsignatures (\"RingCT\").\n\nCT transactions conceal the transfer amounts between parties, while RingCT\nobfuscates both transaction amounts and participant identities. However, RingCT\ntransactions lack programmable outputs, rendering them incompatible with\ndecentralized applications like Particl Marketplace. To address this limitation,\nRingCT inputs can be mapped to CT outputs, which possess programmable\ncapabilities. By chaining these protocols, Particl Marketplace effectively\nharnesses RingCT's enhanced privacy while facilitating seamless integration,\nproviding users with safety — which is otherwise entirely absent without\ntransactional privacy — and the assurance that their financial data remains\nconfidential during transactions.\n\nData-free Marketplace Activity\nSecondly, Particl Marketplace addresses the concerns surrounding excessive data\ncollection practices by centralized eCommerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, and\nEtsy, which have faced criticism for undermining user privacy. Some platforms\nhave even exploited user data to directly compete with their own sellers, as\nexemplified by AmazonBasics products and other Amazon sub-brands – an issue we\nhave previously explored in depth here\n[https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/].\n\nMoreover, while platforms claim to harvest data to enhance user experiences,\ntracking shopping habits can inadvertently expose sensitive information without\nconsent. A notable example is the Target pregnancy prediction case, in which an\nunsuspecting father learned of his daughter's pregnancy due to ad targeting – a\nscenario we’ve also previously discussed here\n[https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/].\n\nTo safeguard against such privacy infringements and data misuse, Particl\nMarketplace is designed to eliminate data generation, collection, storage, or\ndistribution entirely – encompassing both financial and non-financial metadata.\nAll marketplace activity data is stored locally, and all data transmitted (such\nas buyer-seller communications or shipping details) is conveyed through\nend-to-end encrypted messages via SMSG, a peer-to-peer data and messaging\nplatform (\"mixnet\") operating alongside Particl Core nodes\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/].\n\nThis privacy-first architecture ensures user safety and guarantees complete data\nownership and control, while preventing malicious data extraction through hacks,\nexploits, or the simple act of buying or selling online.\n\nConclusion\nWhile various accessibility, usability, and user-experience improvements are\nstill needed, the end result is a decentralized online marketplace that\neliminates fees and associated frictions inherent to third-party intermediaries\nwithin the eCommerce domain.\n\nHowever, beyond these benefits, it primarily serves as a secure platform for\ncryptocurrency users to engage in direct peer-to-peer trade without compromising\ntheir safety by exposing financial information to potentially malicious\nstrangers.\n\nAs we have aimed to clarify with this blog post, privacy in the context of\ncryptocurrency usage transcends a luxury or edge case. In scenarios such as\neCommerce/deCommerce, it is an absolute necessity to ensure the safety and\nwell-being of users transacting with unknown counterparties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

for seamless and\npractical decentralized commerce solutions remains a driving force. Although\nthis is a self-evident use case for crypto, comprehensive solutions to use\ndecentralized money as money, without relying on heavily centralized\narchitecture, is lacking.\n\nWhile achieving this goal has proven challenging, this article explores how\nintegrating BasicSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) that offers Litecoin\npairs, into Particl Marketplace, a decentralized e-commerce platform, offers a\nsolution to overcome many user experience obstacles that have come to hinder the\nevolution of cryptocurrencies as a medium of payment.\n\nBy providing multi-currency support\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-integration-unlocking-currency-agnostic-commerce-on-particl/] \nto the decentralized e-commerce ecosystem, this upcoming integration offers a\ntangible path forward for many coins, unlocking the potential for widespread\ncryptocurrency usage in everyday retail transactions.\n\nWith this in mind, Litecoin, with its focused push as a payment currency, serves\nas the perfect candidate to illustrate this transformative potential, allowing\nanyone to use Litecoin for shopping.\n\nLitecoin; Faster and Cheaper Transactions\nLitecoin has garnered significant attention for its faster transaction times and\nlower fees compared to Bitcoin – a stark contrast to the latter's reputation for\nsluggish and costly processing. This, from the beginning, has positioned\nLitecoin as an ideal cryptocurrency for payments and commerce. Recognizing its\nstrengths in speed and affordability, the Litecoin community has been actively\npromoting its adoption as a practical and viable payment solution for years now.\n\nLitecoin MWEB and Privacy: Solidifying Litecoin as True Digital Cash\nLitecoin's MWEB (MimbleWimble Extension Blocks) introduces a significant\nimprovement to an already payment-friendly digital currency: transactional\nprivacy. This brings confidential transactions and privacy features to the\nLitecoin network, a pivotal development poised to solidify its positioning as\ntrue digital cash and a viable currency for payments.\n\nPrivacy is, of course, a crucial aspect in the realm of digital payments, as it\nsafeguards users' and businesses' financial information and promotes fungibility\n– a fundamental characteristic of sound money.\n\nParticl Marketplace: Redefining Decentralized E-Commerce\nWhile transactional privacy is paramount, it is also crucial for the platform\nfacilitating such payments to uphold privacy as well.\n\nEnvision this scenario: you send a private payment using Litecoin MWEB or even\nMonero to purchase an item online. However, you later discover that this\nplatform has been collecting user data and subsequently fell victim to a data\nbreach, exposing your shipping information, shopping history, along with\naddresses and payment details to an attacker. An absolute nightmare, even if the\ninitial payment was conducted through a private transaction.\n\nThis underscores the fact that private payments alone are insufficient to\ncompletely safeguard your shopping habits and selling history. This fact stands\nas a premise for the design of Particl Marketplace.\n\nParticl Marketplace is a decentralized, privacy-focused e-commerce platform\nbuilt using blockchain and peer-to-peer technology. Unlike traditional\ne-commerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, Etsy, or Alibaba, Particl Marketplace\noperates without intermediaries, ensuring secure and private transactions\nbetween users, free from fees or restrictions. Buyers and sellers transact\ndirectly, benefiting from a two-party escrow system that protects both parties\nand keeps all trade information private to the involved parties only.\n\nUsing Litecoin for Shopping on Particl Marketplace Soon to be AvailableWhile the\nplatform's unapologetically decentralized nature and privacy features make it an\nattractive alternative to centralized e-commerce platforms (which often face\ncensorship, data breaches, and other vulnerabilities), it is currently limited\nto using PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, as the settlement currency. This\nis due to PART’s unique technology being an integral component in enabling some\nof the marketplace's unique features in the first place.\n\nBasicSwap DEX: Enabling Multi-Currency Payments\nLitecoin MWEB Balances and Conversions Live on BasicSwap DEXLitecoin\nMimbleWimble balances and balance conversions are now live on BasicSwap DEX, a\nfirst step towards full MWEB swaps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/litecoin-mweb-balances-and-conversions-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\nBasicSwap DEX is a decentralized exchange protocol and platform powered by\natomic swaps and SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a distributed data and\nmessaging protocol (often referred to as a “mixnet”). It offers a non-custodial\nand privacy-first trading experience, enabling trustless cross-chain swaps\nbetween different cryptocurrencies across various blockchains. And just like\nParticl Marketplace, it imposes no fees, restrictions, or data collection\npractices.\n\nAnd while it has always included Litecoin since its inception, it recently\nintegrated MWEB balances, paving the way for full MWEB swaps once Litecoin's\nupcoming core update — which will detect incoming Litecoin transactions using\nonly the viewkey without requiring the spendkey — goes live.\n\nTrade Litecoin on BasicSwap DEX (Litecoin DEX)By integrating BasicSwap into\nParticl Marketplace, alternative payment options are introduced at the time of\ncheckout, allowing users to seamlessly pay for items using their preferred\ncryptocurrency, a prime candidate of which being the fast and private Litecoin\nMWEB token.\n\nThis synergy aligns perfectly with Litecoin's vision of becoming a viable and\npractical form of digital cash, providing an additional real-world use case that\nfurther solidifies its position.\n\nBuilding Bridges Between Cryptocurrencies\nThe upcoming integration of BasicSwap and Litecoin MWEB on Particl Marketplace\nexemplifies BasicSwap's broader mission of forging bridges between diverse\ncryptocurrency communities and projects through its cross-chain functionality.\nThis synergy unites our efforts toward a shared vision of building a global\neconomy that prioritizes sovereignty and interoperability - the great promise of\ncrypto.\n\nBy enabling the use of Litecoin on Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap fosters a\nsymbiotic relationship that holds immense promise.

This is the future\nof BasicSwap, the atomic swap-based decentralized exchange that promises to be a\ncornerstone of the Particl ecosystem, and a catalyst for the growth of\ndecentralized commerce.\n\nThe Particl Ecosystem: A Beacon of Privacy Against Fiat\nParticl, through a multitude of modular privacy apps, can be understood as an\necosystem designed to respect individuals’ rights, freedoms, and privacy without\ncompromise. \n\nAt the core of the Particl project is the Particl Marketplace, a decentralized\ne-commerce platform that allows buyers and sellers to transact directly without\nintermediaries. This platform is complemented by a suite of privacy-focused\nprotocols that enable users to conduct various activities without relying on\nthird-party service providers.\n\nHowever, as Particl seeks to establish itself as a truly independent and\nself-sustaining ecosystem, a glaring issue has been a lack of avenues for\ninteracting effectively with the Marketplace, and the accessibility shortcomings\nthis represents. \n\nUntil recently, users have had to rely on centralized exchanges or unprotected\nover-the-counter (OTC) deals to acquire PART, the native currency of Particl\nMarketplace settlements, which undermines the platform's core principles of\nprivacy and autonomy.\n\nBridging the Gap: Bringing Decentralized Commerce to All Crypto\nWhile BasicSwap currently functions as an open-source decentralized exchange\napplication designed to facilitate trustless and anonymous trading of digital\nassets for all, its essence transcends that of a mere application; it is\nprimarily a protocol. This distinction, though seemingly minor on the surface,\ncarries profound implications for the future usage and purpose of BasicSwap.\n\nBy integrating it with the Particl Marketplace, thus providing to it\nBasicSwap-powered swap services such as a multi-currency payment option during\ncheckout, it promises to bridge the gap between privacy and decentralized\ncommerce, enabling users to interact with the Particl Marketplace using their\npreferred currency, while seamlessly converting the payment into PART in order\nto interact with certain aspects of the marketplace itself, such as Particl’s\nunique two-party escrow system\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-marketplace/marketplace_escrow.html]\n. The end result is a smooth experience where customers can pay for items in\ntheir preferred currency, which is then converted into PART in the background,\nproviding value to both the end-user and the Particl community of holders.\n\nBenefits that Extend Beyond the Usefulness of Multi-Currency Payments\nOne of the key advantages of BasicSwap is its ability to leverage atomic swap\ntechnology, specifically adaptor signatures, to allow users to exchange\ndifferent cryptocurrencies privately and without the need for a centralized\nintermediary. This not only enhances user security, it also opens up new\npossibilities for inter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects\nand their unique benefits.\n\nImagine a scenario where you wish to purchase an item on the Particl Marketplace\nusing Firo, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that employs the Lelantus protocol\nfor anonymity. With BasicSwap, you can initiate the transaction by sending your\nFiro to a designated address provided by the DEX. \n\nThe coins are then \"burned,\" and the Firo redeem token is exchanged for\nanonymous PART using BasicSwap, which is then used to complete the purchase on\nthe Particl Marketplace. Of course, all of this would happen behind the scenes,\nthe end-user being left with an easy-to-follow and comprehensive user experience\nakin to choosing a “checkout option” on traditional marketplaces.\n\nThis simple act demonstrates the power of atomic swap technology, effectively\ncombining the unique benefits of whatever coin is used as the checkout payment\noption (Firo, Monero, Litecoin MWEB, etc) and RingCT (the privacy protocol used\nby PART) in a single transaction. \n\nBy enabling such inter-compatibility between privacy technologies, BasicSwap\nunlocks a world of possibilities for users seeking to maintain their financial\nprivacy while engaging in decentralized commerce.\n\nThe Implications of a Truly Decentralized and Agnostic Payment System\nWhile the focus of BasicSwap is on bridging privacy projects and privacy coins,\nits true potential extends far beyond this scope. By offering a truly\ndecentralized and agnostic payment system, the BasicSwap protocol opens the door\nto a wide range of use cases and possibilities.\n\nOne exciting prospect is the integration of stablecoins, which could provide a\nmore stable and predictable means of value transfer within the Particl\necosystem. This could be particularly beneficial for e-commerce transactions,\nwhere price volatility can be a concern when cryptocurrency is involved.\n\nMoreover, the potential for anonymous stablecoins, or of anonymous swaps of\nexisting stablecoins, raises intriguing possibilities for enhancing financial\nprivacy while maintaining the benefits of price stability. As the technology\nevolves, BasicSwap's agnostic nature positions it to seamlessly integrate and\nfacilitate the use of such innovative financial instruments within the Particl\nMarketplace and beyond.\n\nConclusion: A Cornerstone for Decentralized Commerce\nThe integration of BasicSwap with the Particl Marketplace represents a\nsignificant milestone in our journey towards financial sovereignty. By providing\na robust and decentralized platform for trading PART and facilitating\ninter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects, BasicSwap is\npoised to become a cornerstone of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nAs the world increasingly recognizes the importance of privacy and autonomy in\nfinancial transactions, platforms like Particl and BasicSwap are poised to lead\nthe way in fostering a truly decentralized and privacy-focused economic\nenvironment. \n\nWith its commitment to agnosticism and its ability to adapt to emerging\ntechnologies, BasicSwap has the potential to revolutionize the way we think\nabout decentralized commerce, paving the way for a future where individuals can\ntransact freely, securely, and without the need for trusted third parties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
