While this integration is still in the testing phase and not yet\nready for a full production roll-out, it represents a major step forward and has\nbeen updated on BasicSwap's dev Github branch.\n\nOur next focus is addressing the management of change during the conversion from\nregular LTC to MWEB balances. Currently, the change from such conversions also\nbecomes MWEB but remains in the regular address instead of transitioning to\nMWEB. Resolving this will be one of our main goals in the coming week.\n\nNew Coin Core Updates ✅\nWe've recently rolled out updates for two coin cores: Firo and Litecoin. As\nalways, we strongly recommend that you keep your core nodes updated to the\nlatest versions, which is particularly important in this instance as both Firo\nand Litecoin have upcoming hardforks — Firo with the introduction of Lelantus,\nand Litecoin with the full integration of MWEB.\n\nFor guidance on how to update your coin cores, please refer to the step-by-step\ninstructions provided in the Particl Academy here\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html]\n.\n\nInstallation Wizard ?‍♂️\nWe've successfully completed testing BasicSwap's installation wizard version 2.0\nfor Windows last week and are now testing it for OSX. It is nearly ready to\npre-release it.\n\nAs a new addition, the updated installer now lets you update the DEX, and also\nincludes additional scripts to update its dependencies and launch the\napplication (not just install it) by double-clicking on an icon.\n\nUser Interface (GUI 2.1) ?️\nWe are making steady progress on finalizing version 2.1 of BasicSwap's user\ninterface, and need a few extra days to finish everything up. \n\nNote that, this week, we've incorporated changes to the user interface to\nsupport the new Litecoin balance types. Additionally, we've made the necessary\nmodifications to accommodate multi-wallet functionality, which will be required\nif coin cores need this feature.\n\nMiscellaneous ✅\n * Investigate and fix issue with wallet unlock getting stuck at \n   SecureMsgWalletUnlocked\n * Make BasicSwap multi-wallet capable\n * Rename rpc_callback -> call_rpc\n\nPrivacy Coins Getting Delisted ⚡️\n> #Monero [https://twitter.com/hashtag/Monero?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] and\nother #privacy\n[https://twitter.com/hashtag/privacy?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] coins like \n#DASH [https://twitter.com/hashtag/DASH?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] or #FIRO\n[https://twitter.com/hashtag/FIRO?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] will soon be\ndelisted from most if not all major centralized exchanges\n\nBut fear not!

This was highlighted this week by the actions of several\nexchanges either delisting privacy coins or demanding the addition of\ntransparent features, limiting their privacy aspects.\n\nWe want to reiterate that BasicSwap DEX stands firm in its commitment to user\nprivacy. It will never ask you to verify your identity, impose arbitrary limits\non you, nor will privacy coins ever be delisted. The DEX is designed to be\ncompletely resilient, operating without centralized control or interference.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, with planned milestones such as web compatibility, light\nnodes, remote services, and more coin listings, the year promises to be a\nsignificant one for BasicSwap. These developments will not only enhance the DEX\nbut also contribute significantly to the ongoing fight for our privacy and\nfreedom.\n\nParticl and BasicSwap Media ?\nPrivacy Roundtable (December 23, 2023) ?️\nIn case you weren't able to catch it live, we've uploaded our latest Privacy\nRoundtable, featuring our friends from PIVX and Firo, to our YouTube channel.\nThe last session was particularly interesting as we delved into the impact of\nAI's advancement on our privacy and were honored to have a co-founder of the\nZano project join us for the discussion.\n\nIf you haven't had the chance to listen to this insightful conversation yet, we\nhighly recommend checking it out. \n\nYoutube Playlists ?️\nWe'd like to take a moment to highlight the fact that we now curate playlists on\nour Youtube channel, making it easier for you to find content that's most\nrelevant to your interests. \n\nThese playlists cover a variety of topics including Particl Marketplace,\nBasicSwap DEX, general information about our project, as well as a compilation\nof recent appearances, interviews, and talks we've participated in.\n\n * Discover our playlists: https://www.youtube.com/@Particl/playlists\n\nDr. Kap's Youtube Channel ▶️\nIf you like watching or listening to Particl's advisor Dr. Kap, you'll be\npleased to learn that he now has a Youtube channel which aggregates past and\nfutures appearances.\n\n * Dr. Kapil Amarasinghe on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/@drkap1\n * Last interview of John McAfee with Dr. Kap and CryptoRamble: \n   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBDFRJSfLCA&list=PLd-1ipx0nhF_Tr1k6T22h8js9joekOAPg\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBDFRJSfLCA&list=PLd-1ipx0nhF_Tr1k6T22h8js9joekOAPg]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
