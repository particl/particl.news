The bug affected the readability of\nSMSG messages when the decryption of an encrypted wallet failed, resulting in\noffers not appearing as expected on the order book. We have now fully resolved\nthis issue, although it took a considerable amount of time to diagnose.\n\nIt's important to note that while this bug posed no risk to user funds or\nsecurity, it did have a significant impact on the user experience when\ntriggered. To ensure the best possible experience on BasicSwap DEX, we recommend\nupdating to the latest version.

This feature would work similarly to how users\ncurrently handle public, blind, and anon balances for Particl.\n\nImplementing this integration for Litecoin's MWEB would provide users with the\nability to convert their balances and perform deposits and withdrawals using\nMWEB transactions. However, it's important to note that Litecoin's upcoming\nmajor MWEB update is still required for full MWEB swaps to be possible.\n\nOur research and development efforts in this area will continue in the coming\nweeks alongside other projects, and we stand at the ready for a full MWEB\nimplementation once the update goes live in a few weeks/months.\n\nAutomated Market Making on a Cloud BSX Instance ☁️\nCloud Setup and Automated Market Making for BasicSwapSetup a BasicSwap cloud\ninstance and effortlessly run automated market making 24/7Particl News\ncryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/the-ultimate-cloud-basicswap-setup-and-automated-market-making/]\nTo help improve liquidity and overcome some of the challenges associated with\nrunning BasicSwap in its current form, we've published two video tutorials that\nshow you how to smoothly run the DEX on a cloud server and automate the process\nof providing liquidity on the DEX using BasicSwap's automated market making\nscript. \n\nCombining these features results in a powerful tool: a 24/7 BasicSwap cloud\ninstance that autonomously and dynamically manages your offers. This not only\nsimplifies the process of providing liquidity on the order book, but also allows\nyou to set a premium percentage above the current market price for any pair you\nprovide liquidity to; opening up the potential for earning arbitrage profits\nwith minimal manual effort required on your part.\n\nInstallation Wizard ?‍♂️\nEarlier this week, our community encountered an issue with swapping Monero on\nWindows via instances that had been set up via the installation wizard. After\ninvestigating, we identified that the problem stemmed from a need to update the\ncoincurve dependency and worked on a new functionality that allows for updating\ndependencies directly through the installer. \n\nWe believe the update to this functionality is now complete. However, to ensure\neverything works smoothly, we plan to spend a bit more time testing the new\nversion of the installer over the weekend, with plans to release the update\nearly next week if all goes well. We are testing the fixes on MacOS as well.\n\nThanks to the community for testing and reporting issues and bugs, your help is\ninvaluable!\n\nUser Interface (GUI 2.1) ?️\nWe were in the process of wrapping up the next update of the user interface when\nwe had to shift our focus temporarily to address the installation wizard issue,\nas previously mentioned. \n\nDespite this pivot, we remain optimistic about our timeline; our goal still\nbeing to have the user interface update ready and released before Christmas.\n\nParticl and BasicSwap Media ?\nFrom today onwards, we'll start reporting some of our media and social media\nappearances we've had for the past week in this new section. This will let you\nfollow what we do more easily, especially if you don't have time for it every\nday.\n\nBasicSwap DEX Talk at Monerokon 2023\nEarlier this year, Particl and BasicSwap developer Kewde delivered a\npresentation at MoneroKon 2023 on the underlying technology behind BasicSwap, as\nwell as the history and future of atomic swaps, particularly in relation to\nMonero.\n\nFor those interested in delving deeper into these topics, the entire\npresentation is available to watch in the embedded video player below.\n\nTwitter Spaces Appearances\nParticl advisor Dr. Kap has recently become more active, showing up in various\nTwitter Spaces discussions, and we've created a new playlist on our YouTube\nchannel [https://particl.news/c/particl] to compile these appearances.\n\nIf you're interested in hearing his insights and discussions, you can follow \nthis link\n[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtbTcMbZZKfzY-nXAF9RcQxTGsUOCCw0C] to\naccess the playlist.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
