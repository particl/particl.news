This week, a lot of focus has been put on adding seemingly small but\nquite useful features and improvements to Particl Marketplace.\n\nOther than that, a good amount of focus has also gone into fixing a few minor\nissues and adding general improvements based on various feedback obtained from\nParticl Marketplace users. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop and Marketplace Progress Update\nAs part of the additions and improvements mentioned in the introduction of this\nprogress report, there are four main items worth mentioning, the others being\nvery minor.\n\n 1. Combined the market ID and access/publish key into a single value. This\n    means that there's now only a single value that needs to be copied/used when\n    sharing/joining a market. This is mostly a convenience modification; instead\n    of needing two different values, a single value can be shared.\n 2. Modified how a template for the product is edited. This was required mostly\n    because the large \"Edit Product\" button on a template resulted in the\n    product template being modified, leading to confusion when an existing\n    market template is published and did not contain the modified content. So\n    now the button to edit the market template has been made a little more\n    visible, and the edit product button has been moved to a different location\n    to ensure that it's easier to understand how to edit an existing item.\n 3. Removing the forced requirement to have the Open Market automatically joined\n    and the ability to remove it from the list of markets your client is\n    connected to. This task is in progress and should be completed imminently.\n 4. Displaying a different graphic and message to indicate when no listings are\n    found but the blockchain is still busy syncing. This is part of a wider push\n    to improve various aspects of the marketplace application that may cause\n    confusion, especially to people who are trying Particl for the first time.\n    You can expect a few updates sharing this goal to be included in the next\n    Particl Desktop update.\n\nWhile the aforementioned items are what received the vast majority of this\nweek's focus, we can confirm that in-market messaging (buyer <> seller\nmessaging) is still the primary priority when it comes to new features for\nParticl Desktop 3.2. \n\nAs previously mentioned, this is an early implementation of a wider \"chat\napplication\" that will ultimately let you discuss with others in total privacy\n(no metadata) and without any central server in between processing and passing\nmessages around. The \"in-market\" implementation, namely the ability for buyers\nand sellers to talk to each other on the marketplace, is the first version of\nthat broader vision.\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Progress Report\nThis week, Particl core developer, Tecnovert, has been busy backporting Taproot\ninto the Particl Core 0.19 codebase. While Taproot will be fully functional on\n0.21 following this coming hardfork\n[https://particl.news/february-2022-hardfork/] (1st of February at 17:00 UTC),\nit wouldn't be the case for Particl Core 0.19 without these current\nmodifications.\n\nTaproot Hardfork Announcement (February 2022)Learn everything you need to know\nabout Particl’s upcoming hardfork and prepare ahead with Particl Core\n0.19.2.18.\nParticl Newscryptoguard [https://particl.news/february-2022-hardfork/]And\nbecause Particl currently uses both the 0.19 and 0.21 codebases, it's important\nto ensure that Taproot is compatible and recognized by 0.19 nodes so that no\nissue arises. But more than that, we are happy to report that 0.19 nodes will\nalso be fully compatible with Taproot, just like 0.21, meaning they will not\nonly recognize Taproot transactions but offer full support for it as well.\n\nAside from this rather large task, Tecnovert has spent a good amount of time\nwriting and running tests to make sure the upcoming hardfork goes through\nwithout any issue.\n\nRenewed Particl Team Funding Proposal is Open for Discussion\nAlthough not a development update per se, we wanted to let you know that the\nParticl team has published, on the CCS platform\n[/particl-development-progress-report-15-01-2022/ccs.particl.io], its renewed\nfunding request [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/12].\n\nTeam Funding Proposal #2Learn all the details about the Particl team’s second\nfunding request from the Treasury Fund.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/team-funding-proposal-2/]As a reminder, the Particl team\nis funded exclusively from the network's decentralized treasury. Every six\nmonths, the team needs to renew its funding with a clear proposal that has to\nget approved by Particl stakeholders.\n\nWith the first funding cycle coming to an end in February, the team's second\nfunding request has been published earlier this week and is currently open for\ndiscussion. We invite you to ask your questions and give your feedback by\nleaving a comment directly on the proposal's CCS page.\n\nThe start block of the voting period will be announced next week, so stay tuned\nto Particl News [https://particl.news] for that important information.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe thank you all for your passion, dedication, and valuable contributions to the\nParticl project; you are what makes Particl possible!\n\nWhether you actively work on expanding the ecosystem or simply use the\nmarketplace and send your feedback to the team, every bit helps shaping the\nfuture of de-commerce (decentralized e-commerce) and easing its adoption!\n\nWe wish you a great weekend and we'll see you, like always, back on Monday ?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
