No payment processor, no marketplace operator,\nno bank, no moderator, no data miner, no nothing. Just you, the person you’re\ntransacting with, and a fully automated two-party escrow system to prevent\nscams.\n\nParticl’s Open Marketplace on Particl Desktop V2This total absence of\nthird-party involvement is completely changing the eCommerce game and is opening\nup a ton of possibilities that simply aren’t possible otherwise. It means that \nfor-profit companies are no longer required for two people to safely transact on\nthe internet. And because no single party runs the Particl marketplace, there is\nno one charging fees to pay for expenses and draw revenue. That’s monumental,\nespecially when you consider that online marketplaces typically charge 5% to up\nto even 50% for the services they offer. A fee that is naturally reflected in\nthe retail price of products and services sold on these marketplaces.\n\nAnd more than just that, Particl also enables this kind of peer-to-peer\neCommerce in a totally private and anonymous way. In fact, a mix of\nprivacy-preserving protocols such as RingCT, CT, stealth addresses, Tor,\nrock-solid encryption, and more, guarantees that you won’t leave any sort of\ndigital footprint behind when shopping or selling online.

Particl is data-free and thus, scandal-free!\n\n> Particl is, put simply, eCommerce 2.0. It is DeCommerce!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIts Evolution Since it Launched\nThe Particl team has pushed a lot of releases to the marketplace since its\ninitial mainnet release on the 12th of August 2019 (Particl Desktop 2.0.0).\nThese releases have seen the addition of several important features and a\nsignificant improvement in all components.\n\nHere are some of the main improvements and added features to the marketplace\nsince its release:\n\n * Questions and answers on listings\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-1-0-released-on-mainnet-1e84cc8716f3]\n * Product/inventory import\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-1-0-released-on-mainnet-1e84cc8716f3]\n * Bitcoin payments\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0]\n * SMSG bots (optional third-party services that can be enabled)\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0]\n * Bid cancellation\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-2-0-released-1a1324881cf8]\n * Listing fee reduction\n   [https://particl.news/adjusting-listing-fees-4b676e230601]\n * Settings [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-2-0-released-1a1324881cf8]\n * Many UI/UX improvements\n * Many marketplace codebase improvements\n * Many bug fixes\n\nThere is no doubt, the Particl marketplace has progressed smoothly along its \nroadmap [http://particl.io/roadmap/] since its mainnet release. It’s been\nsignificantly improved in performance and feel, and it has also received a bunch\nof new features that are now standard use for any Particl user today.\n\nA Completely New Marketplace and Desktop Application\nSince the release of Bitcoin payments\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0] on\nParticl (Particl Desktop 2.3.0) on the 25th of November, the team has been\nworking on its next major feature release (Particl Desktop 2.4.0) —Multi-Markets\n, or “Infinite Markets” as referenced by some in the community.\n\n> Multi-Markets in a NutshellMulti-Markets add the ability to create and join an\ninfinite number of user-created markets and storefronts on the Particl network.\nIt essentially upgrades the Particl marketplace by connecting it to a wide\nnetwork of user-created markets. This is a major item of Particl’s current \nroadmap [http://particl.io/roadmap/].\n\nInitially, Particl Desktop 2.4.0 was only intended to add the ability to create\nor join an infinite number of markets and storefronts, but since this new\nfeature required so much of the codebase to be changed, it turned into a great\nopportunity to make a major leap forward and as a result, became much bigger\nthan anticipated. Here’s why…\n\nRe-Writing Particl Desktop\nParticl Desktop is already a great cryptocurrency wallet. It looks good, feels\ngood, and does everything, and more, that you’d typically need from a crypto\nwallet. As proof, it has often been forked and adapted by other open-source\nprojects to serve as the main desktop wallet.\n\nBut it’s also starting to show its time. Keep in mind, Particl Desktop is\nalready almost three years old now and the team has acquired a lot of experience\nand knowledge since then.\n\nIt may have been ideal for a simple cryptocurrency wallet and early versions of\nthe marketplace, but it has started to show its limitations when tested against\nsome of the most ambitious features and functionalities of the marketplace such\nas multi-markets.\n\nAnd so, because multi-markets already required so much work to be done to both\nthe marketplace codebase and the desktop application, the Particl team decided\nto completely re-write both of them and take it up to the next level.\n\nAs such, all components of Particl Desktop and most of the marketplace codebase\nhave been significantly improved and are now supported by a new and much more\nmodern codebase.\n\nThis is why the next version of Particl Desktop will now be numbered as Particl\nDesktop 3.0.0 instead of 2.4.0.\n\nAdding More Features Than Initially Planned\nPreview of the Marketplace User Dashboard Coming to Particl Desktop 3.0Along the\nway of re-writing everything, it also became evident that some key features of\nthe marketplace initially planned for later on could actually be integrated into\nthe new codebase right away. This would delay the multi-markets release a bit,\nbut would ultimately save a lot of time further down the road and simplify the\nintegration of the new codebase into the desktop application. This is what the\nteam chose to do in a bid to always offer the highest quality around.\n\nFor this reason, the release of multi-markets has been delayed by a bit longer\nthan initially expected, but far from a delay, it’s given the team the\nopportunity to create a mindblowing product that will change the game of\ndecentralized online commerce.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s New With Particl Desktop 3.0\nParticl Desktop V2 is about to retire and the new kid on the block, V3, is\ncoming fast! More than just a number change, this release changes the entire\nback-end code of the desktop application and introduces several features. It is,\nquite literally, Particl’s biggest upgrade since its mainnet launch almost three\nyears ago.\n\nHere are just some of what to expect from Particl Desktop 3.0:\n\nParticl Desktop\n * A much lighter, faster, more responsive and modern desktop application\n * A modular approach and separation of wallets, markets, and the swap engine\n   into different and independent modules\n * All modules (including marketplace) enabled by default on first startup\n * Massively improved user interface and user experience, more intuitive and \n   user-friendly\n * An almost uncountable number of bug fixes, improvements, and tweaks to most\n   components of the wallet and marketplace (many thanks to all the Particl\n   community for the valuable feedback ❤ )\n * A complete overhaul of the in-app swap engine interface\n * SDK friendly desktop application\n\nMarketplace Improvements\n * Addition of a brand new marketplace user dashboard with advanced\n   notifications and quick access to the main sections of your account\n * Addition of multi-markets and the ability to create an infinity of markets\n   and storefronts\n * Addition of the Market Browser and the ability to browse and join any\n   user-created market or storefront. It’s also possible to promote markets in\n   the Market Browser.\n * Improvements to Question and Answers section of listings — easier access and\n   more comprehensive notifications\n * Addition of user identities and profiles\n * Addition of custom categories which can be set per market or storefront\n * Massive reduction in listing fees, will be reduced by more than 80% of\n   current cost. The cost of listing a product on Particl will then be well\n   under a cent worth of PART\n * Improvements to how Particl Desktop, the marketplace codebase, and the SMSG\n   network interact with each other\n\n> Note: Because the V2 and V3 versions of Particl Desktop and the marketplace are\nso radically different, listings won’t be compatible with each other’s version.\nIn other words, listings published on V3 won’t show up on V2, and vice-versa. Of\ncourse, it’s always possible to revert back to a V2 version of the marketplace\nto complete any outstanding order you may still have.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore to Come After the V3 Release\nThe V3 version of Particl will mark a significant step in Particl’s roadmap\n[http://particl.io/roadmap/] as it will cross off many of its items. It will\nalso serve as the trigger for many other initiatives to come to life.\n\nNew Coins to be Added\nOverhaul of the in-App Swap Engine Interface (Particl Desktop V3)After Particl\nDesktop 3.0 goes live, more cryptocurrencies will be added to the in-app swap\nengine. This will be the best time to show the world what Particl has been up to\nin the last few months and come out with a bang in various cryptocurrency\ncommunities.\n\nEncrypted Messaging System\nCurrently under development by DeMarkets.io [https://demarkets.io/], a\ncompletely distributed, private, and encrypted messaging system will allow you\nto communicate with anyone else in the world. Whether that person is a buyer,\nseller, or just a friend, you’ll be able to exchange secure messages on the\nParticl network. Thanks to all the developers at DeMarkets.io\n[http://DeMarkets.io] for the work they’re putting into this decentralized chat\nsystem! ❤\n\nParticl Academy\nThe Particl Academy is going to be Particl’s main informative hub, the\ninteractive user manual. It contains all the basic information and instructions\nrequired to use Particl to its full extent. It’s also written in a way that\nanyone can understand and is meant to make onboarding new users a much easier\ntask.\n\nVendor Onboarding and Outreach Program\nThe Vendor Onboarding and Outreach Program (VOP) is a program designed to help\nmake the process of onboarding new sellers easier and help them make their first\nsteps in the world of decentralized eCommerce. It also provides all the tools\nrequired for anyone to actively participate in reaching out and getting new\nsellers to join Particl.\n\nTo help and support new sellers, the VOP will provide added benefits and perks\nto sellers who opt to register to the program. These include the funding of\nlisting fees, the promotion of markets and storefronts, access to VIP channels,\npersonalized support, more exposure within Particl’s community, and many more\nbenefits. It also provides marketing and informational content to the community\nso that anyone can go out there and find new vendors!\n\nNew Community Voting Mechanism\nThe Partyman cold staking application has recently been updated with some new\nvoting capabilities. This voting system is more private and robust compared to\nthe in-app Proposals system. More details about how to use the voting system and\nhow it will be used to manage the Community Fund will be revealed here on \nParticl.news [http://particl.news] soon.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are still a few weeks separating us from the first Particl Desktop 3.0\nrelease, but it will be well worth the wait!

Just you, the person you’re transacting with, and a fully automated two-party escrow system to prevent scams.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Stepping-Things-Up-Again-With-Particl-Desktop-3-0/1-wDUfOyGBvwgQJyvqAVovFg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl’s Open Marketplace on Particl Desktop V2</figcaption></figure><p>This total absence of third-party involvement is completely changing the eCommerce game and is opening up a ton of possibilities that simply aren’t possible otherwise. It means that <strong>for-profit companies are no longer required for two people to safely transact on the internet</strong>. And because no single party runs the Particl marketplace, there is no one charging fees to pay for expenses and draw revenue. That’s monumental, especially when you consider that <strong>online marketplaces typically charge 5% to up to even 50% for the services they offer</strong>. A fee that is naturally reflected in the retail price of products and services sold on these marketplaces.</p><p>And more than just that, Particl also enables this kind of peer-to-peer eCommerce in a <strong>totally private and anonymous</strong> way. In fact, a mix of privacy-preserving protocols such as <strong>RingCT</strong>, <strong>CT</strong>, <strong>stealth addresses</strong>, <strong>Tor</strong>, rock-solid <strong>encryption</strong>, and more, guarantees that you won’t leave any sort of digital footprint behind when shopping or selling online.

These releases have seen the addition of several important features and a significant improvement in all components.</p><p>Here are some of the main improvements and added features to the marketplace since its release:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-1-0-released-on-mainnet-1e84cc8716f3\"><strong>Questions and answers on listings</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-1-0-released-on-mainnet-1e84cc8716f3\"><strong>Product/inventory import</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0\"><strong>Bitcoin payments</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0\"><strong>SMSG bots (optional third-party services that can be enabled)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-2-0-released-1a1324881cf8\"><strong>Bid cancellation</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/adjusting-listing-fees-4b676e230601\"><strong>Listing fee reduction</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-2-0-released-1a1324881cf8\"><strong>Settings</strong></a></li><li>Many UI/UX improvements</li><li>Many marketplace codebase improvements</li><li>Many bug fixes</li></ul><p>There is no doubt, the Particl marketplace has progressed smoothly along its <a href=\"http://particl.io/roadmap/\"><strong>roadmap</strong></a><strong> </strong>since its mainnet release.

It essentially upgrades the Particl marketplace by connecting it to a wide network of user-created markets. This is a major item of Particl’s current <a href=\"http://particl.io/roadmap/\"><strong>roadmap</strong></a>.<br></blockquote><p>Initially, <strong>Particl Desktop 2.4.0</strong> was only intended to add the ability to create or join an infinite number of markets and storefronts, but since this new feature required so much of the codebase to be changed, it <strong>turned into a great opportunity to make a major leap forward</strong> and as a result, became much bigger than anticipated.

The Particl team is also opening up a \nvoluntary donation address for community members to support outreach\ninitiatives.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA Marketplace for Everyone\nCryptocurrency communities tend to be tribal by nature, but Particl has always\nstrived to be a project building solutions that everybody can benefit from. It’s\nin the project’s DNA. As such, Particl’s decentralized marketplace and desktop\nclient is designed to be able to accept a multitude of payment options, not just\nits native coin (PART).\n\nThe rationale for this inclusive approach is simple\n[https://particl.news/bitcoin-particl-building-an-independent-economy-together-b293e214a094]\n—privacy, security, reliability, and being able to buy and sell anything online \nwithout censorship, restrictions, interference, nor fees, should be made easily\navailable to everyone in the world and not be exclusive to one community only.\nThe technology exists and has been live for a while, what good would it do and\nwhat societal progress would it really trigger if it’s kept exclusive to a\nselect group of individuals?\n\nBitcoin Accepted Here\nWith this in mind, Particl added the ability to make Bitcoin payments\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0] as\npart of Particl’s marketplace checkout process and as a standalone swap engine\nin December 2019. This allowed anyone possessing Bitcoin to spend it anonymously\nand buy anything available on the marketplace using the world’s most popular\ncryptocurrency. No more third-party Bitcoin payment processors required at all,\nno more data harvesting, no more restrictions or censorship, and no more\ntransaction fees!\n\nOf course, Particl’s inclusive approach is much more ambitious than simply\naccepting Bitcoin! Anything from fiat forms of payments to other\ncryptocurrencies are intended goals that are meant to be achieved by Particl. A\nmulti-purpose tool called “Particl bots” were invented for this specific purpose\n—they are little middle-ware programs that interact with the Particl network and\nprovide opt-in third-party services (i.e. swap/exchange services).\n\nThe Particl team planned on adding many new coins in its next release, but since\nit ended up taking a bit longer than anticipated, and for very good reasons\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\n, the decision was made to act right away before the Particl Desktop 3.0 release \nand provide the marketplace with an immediate added value.\n\nStepping Things Up Again With Particl Desktop 3.0\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\nA New Breakthrough for Privacy and eCommerce ?particl.news\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNew Coins Coming in Just a Few Days\nThe Particl team is excited to announce that, starting in just a few days, new\ncoins will be added to Particl Desktop. This will allow you to buy anything with\nthem on the Particl marketplace or simply swap them for PART straight from the\nclient.\n\nThe first two coins that are going to be added will be DAI\n[https://makerdao.com/en/], the stablecoin from the MakerDAO team, and Zcoin\n[https://zcoin.io/], a leading privacy coin with a solid but different privacy\nprotocol than Particl’s!\n\nNew Benefits Unlocked\nOn one hand, adding these two coins instantly provides the marketplace with a \nbig boost in accessibility and usability. On the other hand, it allows more\npeople than ever to be able to use the marketplace without breaking a sweat\nsimply by spending their favorite digital currency! And that’s all possible\nwithout having to manually swap DAI [https://makerdao.com/en/] or Zcoin\n[https://zcoin.io/] for PART on an exchange first. It’s done straight from the\nParticl wallet.\n\nSo whether you’re a stablecoin holder that just wants to live off the economical\ngrid, or whether you’re more interested in the privacy aspect of\ncryptocurrencies and want to take things a step further by mixing privacy\nprotocols together, that will all be possible in just a few days. Particl’s\nrange of use-cases just got way bigger!\n\nAn Important Note on Transaction Settlements\nAlthough Particl will start listing new coins on its platform, it needs to be\npointed out that all marketplace transactions are meant to be settled in PART.\nThis provides the privacy aspects of the marketplace and the ability to use its\ntwo-party escrow system\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-double-deposit-mad-escrow-b3699dd29768].\n\nFor this reason, any currency added to Particl needs to be swapped into PART\nbefore concluding a marketplace transaction. This is possible by either using\nthe standalone swapping module included in Particl Desktop before making an\nonline purchase or by simply swapping coins as part of the checkout process once\nyou’re ready to pay for your shopping cart.\n\nIn other words, any non-PART transaction is ultimately settled, in full, as a\nPART transaction.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDonations Can Bring Particl a Long Way\nWould you like to be PART of Particl’s success? The Particl team is opening a \ndonation deposit address to help fund outreach initiatives related to the\nlisting of new coins. Funds will be used for various initiatives such as\ncreating and giving away free custom merchandise and goodies, run contests,\ngiveaways, and other similar promotional efforts.\n\nMaybe you have a great idea on how to improve Particl’s exposure as new coins\nget added? If that’s the case, then join our Telegram [https://t.me/ParticlOn] \nor Discord [https://discord.me/particl] community right away and take part in\nthe discussion!\n\n> Outreach donation address (public): PYwXDHE8B9zTaeTxy95i8z7L9MfaQpzKWe\n[https://explorer.particl.io/address/PYwXDHE8B9zTaeTxy95i8z7L9MfaQpzKWe]\nOutreach donation address (private): \nSPH3GootfeBkwfTFxpRCDQaZaMLRJSsXfNdJrpM3u2WEduY8CndEy8HvdySeN7NnJdwJ2iYBt5f1S1arMnKbr8i6MYMLf4qSq5Xjdn\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat Coin Would You Want to See on Particl?\nWith this, Particl is getting more accessible and more approachable than it has\never been. Don’t forget, adding DAI [https://makerdao.com/en/] and Zcoin\n[https://zcoin.io/] is only a beginning, but it provides instant added value to\nthe marketplace and these coins as well.\n\nWhat coins would you like to see next? Are you a fan of a particular crypto\ncommunity and would love to use your favorite coin on Particl? Then let the team\nknow by filling the listing application form which that will appear on Particl’s\nwebsite next week or by talking about it in the Particl community.

making good progress in\nbuilding and improving on the marketplace as well as adding a ton of\nfunctionalities. It’s safe to say, this new revamped marketplace is bound to\nimpress more than a few heads. Not only will it look much better and be a lot\neasier to use, but it’s performance will also feel like day and night for anyone\nthat has used the marketplace before.\n\nHere is the latest development report from Development Manager Henk Swardt.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProgress Report\n * As most of you are already aware now, a new version of Particl Desktop\n   (2.3.3.) was released a short while ago. This introduced a slightly updated\n   marketplace codebase in order to address a bug experienced in the buyflow\n   when using Particl Core 0.19. While the update and change went well, some\n   problems were encountered during the signing and notarizing of the Mac\n   builds, which delayed the release a little. This, unfortunately, took some\n   time to fix and get working again, but eventually got sorted and we were able\n   to release the builds.\n * The basics of the re-implementation of the listing details view (effectively\n   the modal that is displayed when clicking on a listing) into Particl Desktop\n   has been completed. We’re now using this specific modal in more places now in\n   order to provide details on a particular listing or order wherever it may be\n   necessary to do so. For example, it is now displayed during the buyflow when\n   needing to look over the details of the item ordered without having to jump\n   off the page. This is a common behaviour for most online marketplaces and\n   will now be part of Particl as well.\n * After some discussions and testing around the creation and display of product\n   templates, as well as the publishing of them into marketplace listings, there\n   was a need to modify and re-work some aspects of the way this was being done\n   in the new ‘Sell’ section of the market module in the Particl Desktop. This\n   re-work is currently in progress.\n * A new “Inventory & Products” tab in the ‘Sell’ section has been added. This\n   will act as a central place for your products in stock (which effectively\n   means splitting the Sell > Listings tab into two separate ones).\n * Due to the integration of “infinite markets” and necessary for it, you can\n   now see which inventory items are published on which markets and storefronts.\n   This will also help with Quantity Management in the future, one of Particl’s\n   current roadmap items.\n * A new batch publish feature for pushing created/imported inventory items\n   (Products) on the marketplace is currently being worked on.\n * The “Import Listings” section of Particl Desktop has now become “Import\n   Products” and has been significantly redesigned to be easier to use.\n * The interface and usability of the escrow process and Market modals for\n   pushing Orders to next their next stages (ie. Accept bid, Mark as delivered,\n   etc.) has been redesigned.\n * The Market Overview page has been redesigned to work more as a guidepost or\n   dashboard for a quick overview of the latest activity that has happened since\n   the last visit — clicking on a card will take you directly to the relevant\n   place.\n * The Questions and Answers layout has been globally redesigned and reused at\n   multiple places for easier access (i.e. directly in a Listing’s details and\n   in a dedicated Sell/Buy > Questions & Answers tab).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSneak Peeks\nTo better illustrate some of the changes currently being worked on, here are\nsome live screenshots taken from the latest internal builds. Please keep in mind\neverything showed here is still a work in progress and subject to change before\nthe release.\n\nMarket’s Overview Page\nThe Market’s Overview page will now act as a guidepost or dashboard for getting\na quick but detailed overview of all actions requiring your attention.\n\nReworked Exchange Module\nParticl Desktop’s in-app swap section has been fully isolated from other modules\nand now acts as its own independent module. Coins and exchanges displayed in\nthis screenshot are not announcements of any sort but rather a good\ndemonstration of where this module is headed UI/UX-wise.\n\nQuestions and Answers\nAs mentioned in the Progress Report of this Development Update, the Q/A\nfunctionality has now been integrated into additional pages for easier access.\nUsers will now be notified whenever they receive a new question or answer to a\nlisting and will be able to navigate to it without much hassle.\n\nMarket Settings\nThe Market Settings page allows you to manage market-related settings. As more\nfeatures and functionalities get added to the marketplace moving forward, here\nis where you’ll be able to tweak their settings as well as your preferences.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Development-Update--05-06-2020-/1-DDaMGsjP5VvVlMaj3HTYQg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>For the past few weeks, the Particl developers have been making good progress in building and improving on the marketplace as well as adding a ton of functionalities.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult.

In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from 6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will increase from 3% to 3.5<strong>%</strong> for the next year.
