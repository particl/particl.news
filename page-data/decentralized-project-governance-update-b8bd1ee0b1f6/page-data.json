Simply put, this\nmechanism allows anyone to be able to vote or submit up for a vote a formal\nproposal to the Particl community.\n\nNote: The initial version of the governance system will not contain all the\nfeatures and functionalities that are planned for later versions (i.e. voting\nweight). It will, however, be its first “working version” and will contain most\n(or all) of the basic functionalities. The governance mechanisms will, of\ncourse, be a moving target for some time as we experiment with it in real-life\nscenarios.\n\nHow Does it Work?\nCommunity Proposal ScreenAs many of you already know, Particl has had a fully\ndecentralized voting system on our mainnet ever since it launched in July 2017.\nThis feature, however, has always only been available on CLI (non-graphical\nParticl wallet) and is relatively restrictive in nature. For example, using the\n“legacy” voting system of Particl, it was not possible to vote on two proposals\nat the same time. This behavior not being the most scalable for a truly useful\ndecentralized governance system, the team has been actively working on improving\nthis voting mechanism to give it more flexibility and accessibility.\n\nThe first improvement was to implement it into Particl Desktop, the main wallet\nfor the Particl network. Because Particl-cli isn’t really used by most people\noutside of staking — and more importantly, because users are more likely to use\na simple, well-designed interface to provide them a voice on the network — it\nwas really important to port this feature over our main client.\n\nDecentralized Voting ScreenOnce implemented, it will be possible to go through\nthe entire proposal process directly from Particl Desktop. Indeed, users will be\nable to both create a proposal from scratch and submit it to the community for a\nvoting round. Any Particl user will then be able to navigate to their voting\nscreen and vote on any ongoing proposal. To vote, users do not need to be\nstaking anymore, and weight will ultimately be based on coin weight rather than\nstaking weight. This decision has been made in order to increase the governance\ntool’s accessibility and speed at which consensuses can be reached.\n\nIn fact, users that own fewer amounts of coins are less likely to put up their\ncoins for staking, yet they ideally still need to have a way to express their\nvoice so that the governance system can truly be considered democratic and\ndecentralized. There are many other reasons users would not want to put their\ncoins up for staking, yet when the project governance tool releases on mainnet,\nthey will still be able to partake in the project’s decentralized governance\nprocess they have a stake in.\n\nTallying the number of coins instead of the staking weights is also a much more\naccurate and quick measurement. Indeed, Proof-of-Stake relies partly on luck,\nsimilarly to PoW mining, which is democratically not ideal for obvious reasons;\naccurate results are more interesting than results partly defined by luck. This\nnew governance system mostly requires users to sign a message proving they own\nthe number of coins that they do and that they are voting from their outputs.\nDon’t worry, this all happens automatically under the hood while the entire\ngovernance process is displayed in a user-friendly fashion on Particl Desktop.\nTallying coins instead of staking weights also allows the mechanism to find\nconsensuses more rapidly in certain situations, a feat that is definitely useful\nas that same mechanism is also the basis for the marketplace governance system\nwhere undesirable content needs to be taken out as quickly as possible.\n\nVotes are tallied every time a user votes, which means that as you move your\ncoins around, so do your votes as well. It is thus possible to easily change\nyour vote if you move your coins before a voting round completes.\n\nCold Voting\nThe project governance mechanism is also built with hardware compatibility in\nmind. In fact, as stated in yesterday’s announcement of the integration of\nParticl on the Ledger Nano S\n[https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae],\nusers will eventually be able to “cold vote” using their Ledger Nano S hardware\ndevice directly from the Particl Desktop client. This is probably not a feature\nthat will be available out of the box once the project governance system hits\nmainnet as it still requires a bit of work on our end, but it will ultimately be\navailable at some point in the future. This is directly related to our\ncommitment to develop and make available the most secure blockchain solutions in\nthe industry. To understand the significance of cold voting vs regular,\nespecially as it relates to security, read our Hardware Cold Staking\nannouncement here\n[https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae].\n\nCommunity Initiative Fund\nBack when Particl users were asked to generate their keys and prepare for the\nParticl genesis block, an initiative has been proposed by the community to\ncompensate SDC coin holders who had failed to swap their coins within the given\nswap timeframe. As such, the community donated an impressive amount of over \n156,000 PART\n[https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/address.dws?RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM.htm] \nto be paid to the late swappers. Since the clemency period was set up to last\nup\nuntil the last day of 2017\n[https://particl.news/a-community-driven-initiative-e26724100c3a], it wasn’t\npossible at the time to know how many late swappers would claim their PART\ncoins, thus making the donation target a blind one. For this reason, Particl\nusers ended up donating an excess amount of coins to the Community Initiative\nFund. This address contains, without any late swapping claims being accepted\nanymore, a final total amount of 33,817.64 PART.\n\nThe Community in Control\nThe Community Initiative Fund is a donation address owned by the Particl\ncommunity itself. In fact, since its funds originate from community donations,\nneither the Particl Foundation nor the Particl team can move them around without\nany form of community consensus first.\n\nTo facilitate debates around proposed solutions, ideas, and proposals made on\nhow to best use these funds, we’ve announced\n[https://particl.news/building-a-framework-for-community-contribution-e056c04c9c09] \nand created back in January a Kialo discussion thread\n[https://www.kialo.com/invited?token=005-7c0b9545-ef61-4b50-a65d-205fe37fc65e].\nKialo is a good debate platform where users can form arguments and\ncounter-arguments in a structured and easy-to-follow fashion.\n\nAs we are nearing the testnet and mainnet implementations of the project\ngovernance system on Particl Desktop, there has never been a better time to put\ndown on paper and on Kialo any proposal idea you have been thinking about. The\nbest way to get your proposal accepted by the community is to create excitement\nleading up to the voting round, therefore initiating discussions around your\nproject early on could end up helping your proposal being voted in favor of. If\nyou submit any idea on Kialo, make sure to post about it on our Discord server\nor in the coming Particl forum so that people can know and discuss it.\n\nAs the decentralized project governance system still requires a bit of work and\nof course, testing, there is still some time left to prepare your proposals\nuntil we hold official voting rounds related to the Community Initiative Fund.\nMore details about these rounds will be included in a next Decentralized Project\nGovernance Update.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDon’t forget that you can track most of the development process by following us\non Github [https://github.com/particl]. Make sure to also join our Discord\ncommunity [https://discord.gg/uvSpbQN] and #BePART of the fight for privacy!\n\nThe Particl Team","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Decentralized-Project-Governance-Update/1-UeS0EbcHl617Ni2TRx8uYg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>As we’ve highlighted in our third <a href=\"https://particl.news/community-update-3-407404771f11\"><em>Community Update</em></a>, the Particl team <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1087\">has begun working on the initial version of the project governance mechanism</a>.

This new governance system mostly requires users to sign a message proving they own the number of coins that they do and that they are voting from their outputs. Don’t worry, this all happens automatically under the hood while the entire governance process is displayed in a user-friendly fashion on Particl Desktop.

Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\nWill it be possible to have prices displayed in their fiat value?\nWhile currently not available on Particl Marketplace Alpha, yes, this is\nsomething that ultimately would be part of Particl Marketplace. Paul speculated\nabout how this feature could look like in Particl Desktop, but the takeaway\npoint is that this wouldn’t be hard to include on the marketplace and is a\nfeature that will, in the end, be enabled.\n\nWill there be a “Share” feature where vendors will be able to send a link to\ntheir product listing on the web?\nEverything is “social” right now, so being able to share a listing is a vital\nfunction for a marketplace. This is actually how private listings are designed.\nIn fact, the entire nature of private listings is that they aren’t displayed on\nthe public interface of the marketplace and can only be accessed through a\ncustom link or key. It hasn’t been settled yet whether this sharing feature\nwould also be available on public listings but it should ultimately be.\n\nWe’ll also soon be publishing an interview with Albin from Mubiz. Mubiz is a web\n& mobile decentralized marketplace gateway that makes available buying items on\ndecentralized marketplaces using their website just like any other eCommerce\nplatform. They do plan on integrating Particl into their platform which would\nmake the sharing of listings very easy (simply copy-paste the URL link).\n\nIs it possible to have the order at which releases will be ready without any\nspecific dates?\nThe two biggest items required for Particl Marketplace to go live on mainnet are\nthe marketplace governance system and the RingCT privacy protocol. As we are\nalso heavily focused on security, we always prefer introducing features on\ntestnet first, especially major updates such as the governance system and the\nRingCT protocol. As most of you already know, RingCT has been on our mainnet\never since Day 1 but has only recently been validated by both the NJIT\nDepartment of Security academic review and WeSecureApp’s audit.\n\nWe can also confirm by now that RingCT and the marketplace governance tool are\ngoing to be part of the same hardfork. This should give a good idea of what the\nnext steps are going to be: the marketplace governance system is going to hit\ntestnet then, after proper testing, will be integrated onto Particl mainnet\nintegration alongside RingCT.\n\nThere are, of course, other features that may hit testnet or mainnet within that\ntimeframe, but as far as the critical path to Particl Marketplace mainnet\nrelease goes, governance and RingCT are the two items to look out for.\n\nAs always, you can always have a look at our Status Report which should be\nupdated soon.\n\nHave a notification system for vendors been put in place?\nAbsolutely, as you can see in our Status Report, this feature has been\nintegrated onto Particl Marketplace and is currently in its final review phase.\n\nHas the new Particl Desktop developer started working yet?\nYes, his first day with us was on August 1st. We’ll soon make a blog post\nintroducing him to the community as well as linking to his Github account like\nwe usually do.\n\nAny new Particl merchandise coming up?\nYes, it’s definitely going to happen. We have started looking into various types\nof merch we would like to giveaway to the community and have even made a poll\non\nTwitter asking for your suggestions\n[https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1027253285277900801].\n\nWe’re planning on both giving merch away on Particl Marketplace Alpha but also\nusing our new Discord GiveawayBot which we used to run our Ledger Nano S contest\nwith. Keep an eye out for any future announcement of free merch being made\navailable!\n\nIs there any update about the PIVX Alliance conference call?\nYes, we had Imran, Ryno, and Cryptoguard participate in that call and we agreed\nwith PIVX to submit a proposal to the PIVX community. The proposal states that\nPART would get listed on PIVX for free in exchange for a PIVX integration right\ninto Particl Marketplace. The two social media teams would then help each other\nout with some cross-promotion campaign.\n\nBoth teams have also discussed doing a zPIV integration to Particl Marketplace,\neffectively allowing users to combine both Zerocoin and RingCT privacy protocols\nin a single transaction for the ultimate privacy package. This integration\nwould, however, be a monster of itself. Both teams are interested in this\nconcept and it could definitely make for a great joint project. For the moment,\nboth teams have a lot on their plate and have other priorities, but it’s\ndefinitely being kept in mind on both sides.\n\nThe proposal hasn’t been voted on by the PIVX community yet, we will be giving\nout details when that happens. It will be interesting to see how this pans out!\n\nEDIT: For clarity’s sake, PIVX transactions on the marketplace will still\nultimately be converted into PART so that the marketplace can run its MAD escrow\nsmart-contract and utilize the RingCT protocol offered by PART.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nLedger Hardware Integration is Here!\nUpdate [10–08–2018]: There is a known issue with setting up Ledger on Particl-Qt\nMacOS. Mac users should download Particl-Qt 0.16.2.0 (pre-release) by following\nthis link: https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.16.2.0\n\nUpdate [10–08–2018]: The tutorial for cold staking from your Ledger Nano S is\ncurrently not available. Our team is working on figuring the best temporary\nsolution to allow staking while the full Ledger integration onto Particl Desktop\nis completed. More details about both the tutorial and the Particl Desktop\nintegration will be given out in further updates.\n\nUpdate [10–08–2018]: Your Particl balance will not show up on Ledger Live’s\nPortfolio interface. The Particl Ledger application currently only supports\nstoring Particl on the Ledger Nano S and using the Particl features (staking,\nvoting, transacting, etc). Ledger Live’s Portfolio may or may not come at a\nlater time, this mostly depends on Ledger.\n\nParticl, Bitcoin & PIVX on the Ledger NanoAfter having submitted our own Ledger\n“third-party application\n[https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005161545-List-of-supported-applications]\n” to Ledger [https://www.ledger.com/] weeks ago, it has finally been officially\nintegrated into Ledger’s Nano S hardware devices\n[https://www.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s] and Ledger Live\n[https://www.ledger.com/pages/ledger-live]. That means you can now safely store\nyour PART private keys on the Ledger Nano S device, dramatically increasing the\nsecurity of your funds as well as the entire ecosystem. This also makes Particl\nthe first pure Proof-of-Stake coin to offer hardware cold staking, or even just\nsimply hardware staking.\n\n> As a matter of fact, no matter how strong your passwords are or safely hidden\nyour wallet files are, you are still putting yourself at great risk of getting\nhacked the moment you either enter a password or upload a wallet file on a\ncomputer or mobile device. Indeed, cryptocurrencies have become one of the prime\ntargets for hackers and cyber thieves, and there are now several ways infected\ncomputers could result in the total loss of coins stored on unsafe wallets.—\nParticl Introduces Hardware Cold Staking\n[https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae]\nThe Ledger Nano S [https://www.ledger.com/] is a hardware wallet, a special type\nof bitcoin wallet which stores the user’s private keys in a secure hardware\ndevice. They have major advantages over standard software wallets: private keys\nare stored in a secure chip, and cannot be transferred out of the device in\nplaintext. That means your funds are safe even when connected to an infected or\nmalicious computer or a phishing/scam web page.\n— Manage Particl on Ledger Nano S [http://particl.wiki/ledger]\n\nFurthermore, we strongly believe those looking for the highest level of security\nshouldn’t be limited in what they can do on the Particl platform, especially as\nit relates to its governance (true democracy -> no voice left unheard). As such,\nthis Ledger integration is designed to be compatible with almost all, if not\nstraight up all the functions of the Particl platform including, but not limited\nto, transacting funds, staking, voting and submitting proposals to the community\nas well as participating in the marketplace’s governance system without ever\nrequiring to expose their private keys.\n\nThis announcement marks a very important step in Particl’s journey,\ndemonstrating the team’s commitment to not only build the most secure blockchain\nsolutions but to also deliver them in a perfectly accessible and flexible\npackage that does not infringe on the user experience.\n\nDecentralized Project Governance\nWe also posted this week about the new and improved decentralized project\ngovernance\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6] that\nis nearing testnet implementation. In fact, we identified several issues with\nour legacy voting system (which has been on mainnet since Day 1) that makes it\ntoo restrictive in nature for what the Particl platform is aiming to do.\n\nThe main difference between the new governance system and the legacy one resides\nin the fact that any user will be able to vote for multiple proposals at the\nsame time and do so directly from Particl Desktop regardless of if their funds\nare stored on a hot, cold, paper, or hardware wallet. We believe this update to\nthe Project Governance system is a huge improvement both in terms of usability\nand democratic accurateness, and so we are very excited to run it through its\nfinal testing phase and to begin testnet integration.\n\nWe also announced in our Decentralized Project Governance update\n[https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6] that\nthere were a total of ~33,800 PART\n[https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/address.dws?RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM.htm] \nleft in the Community Initiative Fund and that we would be ready to initiate\nvoting rounds on what to do with the funds once the Project Governance tool hits\nmainnet. As such, it could be a good idea to start thinking about proposals and\nideas on how to best use the 33,800 PART that does belong to the community.\n\nParticl Core 0.17.0.2…Really?!?\nFor those keeping a close eye on Particl’s Github page, it may not come out as a\nsurprise that Tecnovert [https://github.com/tecnovert], our Core Developer &\nCryptographic Researcher, has ALREADY started working on Particl Core 0.17.0.2\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.0.2alpha]. TV is\nknown for being the fastest developer in the entire industry to adapt and merge\nthe latest Bitcoin codebase into Particl Core whenever there is an update to it.\nUsually, it takes a few weeks, sometimes even days after the release. But this\ntime, it seems like Tecnovert has been working overtime on 0.17, so it will be\ninteresting to see if he has anything special under the hood or if he’s just\nbeing extremely diligent.\n\nFor a rough 0.17 release timeline from Bitcoin Core, please visit this link: \nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/12624.\n\nNew Status Report\nWe released on the third of August a new Status Report on our website\n[http://particl.io/status-report/]. This report is quite similar to our \nprevious\nStatus Report [https://particl.news/new-status-report-released-8ca69930cfd] but\nalso contains some new, exciting information about the state of Particl\nMarketplace development. Indeed, the “Wrapped Up” section of the report shows\nthat a lot of items for the marketplace have been completed, including the\nProject Governance and Marketplace Governance tools. Some of the items marked as\n“Pending Review” have also been completed since we posted this report 7 days\nago, including the Ledger hardware integration\n[https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae] and\nthe Particl Desktop 1.2.2\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2] (currently on\npre-release, mainnet). A new Status Report should be posted soon and we will\npost an update here on particl.news [http://particl.news].\n\nDevelopment is at an All-Time High!\nJiraThe development process of the Particl project has never been in such good\nshape. Indeed, the project has reached a stage where our team has gained a lot\nof experience and have adapted their work methods to better organize and deliver\nmore efficiently. That much can be seen on our Github with as much as 3 to 6\nrepositories being updated daily and by how fast items in our Status Report are\ngetting hammered.\n\nA lot of this can be attributed to our two new managers, Carmen and Vivienne, as\nwell as the new Agile methodologies [https://linchpinseo.com/the-agile-method/] \nand strategies the team has established during its last meeting in Prague. It is\nworth noting that Github is only the tip of the iceberg, most of the development\nprocess and communications happening internally using Jira\n[https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira].\n\nAs we are seeing a lot of items being marked as completed and as we keep hiring\nnew developers such as our new Particl Desktop developer or any developer we\nwill be hiring after the primary funding round, the Particl project is slowly\nentering into a new phase. We will soon reach a point where a lot of the pieces\nwill start falling into place in a relatively short period of time while the\ndevelopment pace keeps increasing. Furthermore, the future release of our\ndeveloper SDK should also attract many more “outside” developers contributing\nthemselves to the accelerating development pace of the project. Simply put, we\nbelieve our best days are ahead of us and at arm’s length.\n\nTeaser: We will post next week a video demonstrating the impressive work our\ndevelopers have put into Particl since we embarked on this journey a little more\nthan a year ago. This demonstration will be in the form of a Github contribution\ntimeline and will help understand several factors associated with the\ndevelopment of an open-source project.

Paul speculated about how this feature could look like in Particl Desktop, but the takeaway point is that this wouldn’t be hard to include on the marketplace and is a feature that will, in the end, be enabled.</p><h3 id=\"will-there-be-a-share-feature-where-vendors-will-be-able-to-send-a-link-to-their-product-listing-on-the-web\">Will there be a “Share” feature where vendors will be able to send a link to their product listing on the web?</h3><p>Everything is “social” right now, so being able to share a listing is a vital function for a marketplace. This is actually how private listings are designed. In fact, the entire nature of private listings is that they aren’t displayed on the public interface of the marketplace and can only be accessed through a custom link or key. It hasn’t been settled yet whether this sharing feature would also be available on public listings but it should ultimately be.</p><p>We’ll also soon be publishing an interview with Albin from Mubiz. Mubiz is a web &amp; mobile decentralized marketplace gateway that makes available buying items on decentralized marketplaces using their website just like any other eCommerce platform. They do plan on integrating Particl into their platform which would make the sharing of listings very easy (simply copy-paste the URL link).</p><h3 id=\"is-it-possible-to-have-the-order-at-which-releases-will-be-ready-without-any-specific-dates\">Is it possible to have the order at which releases will be ready without any specific dates?</h3><p>The two biggest items required for Particl Marketplace to go live on mainnet are the marketplace governance system and the RingCT privacy protocol. As we are also heavily focused on security, we always prefer introducing features on testnet first, especially major updates such as the governance system and the RingCT protocol. As most of you already know, RingCT has been on our mainnet ever since Day 1 but has only recently been validated by both the NJIT Department of Security academic review and WeSecureApp’s audit.</p><p>We can also confirm by now that RingCT and the marketplace governance tool are going to be part of the same hardfork. This should give a good idea of what the next steps are going to be: the marketplace governance system is going to hit testnet then, after proper testing, will be integrated onto Particl mainnet integration alongside RingCT.</p><p>There are, of course, other features that may hit testnet or mainnet within that timeframe, but as far as the critical path to Particl Marketplace mainnet release goes, governance and RingCT are the two items to look out for.</p><p>As always, you can always have a look at our Status Report which should be updated soon.</p><h3 id=\"have-a-notification-system-for-vendors-been-put-in-place\">Have a notification system for vendors been put in place?</h3><p>Absolutely, as you can see in our Status Report, this feature has been integrated onto Particl Marketplace and is currently in its final review phase.</p><h3 id=\"has-the-new-particl-desktop-developer-started-working-yet\">Has the new Particl Desktop developer started working yet?</h3><p>Yes, his first day with us was on August 1st. We’ll soon make a blog post introducing him to the community as well as linking to his Github account like we usually do.</p><h3 id=\"any-new-particl-merchandise-coming-up\">Any new Particl merchandise coming up?</h3><p>Yes, it’s definitely going to happen. We have started looking into various types of merch we would like to giveaway to the community and have even made a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1027253285277900801\">poll on Twitter asking for your suggestions</a>.</p><p>We’re planning on both giving merch away on Particl Marketplace Alpha but also using our new Discord GiveawayBot which we used to run our Ledger Nano S contest with. Keep an eye out for any future announcement of free merch being made available!</p><h3 id=\"is-there-any-update-about-the-pivx-alliance-conference-call\">Is there any update about the PIVX Alliance conference call?</h3><p>Yes, we had Imran, Ryno, and Cryptoguard participate in that call and we agreed with PIVX to submit a proposal to the PIVX community. The proposal states that PART would get listed on PIVX for free in exchange for a PIVX integration right into Particl Marketplace. The two social media teams would then help each other out with some cross-promotion campaign.</p><p>Both teams have also discussed doing a zPIV integration to Particl Marketplace, effectively allowing users to combine both Zerocoin and RingCT privacy protocols in a single transaction for the ultimate privacy package. This integration would, however, be a monster of itself. Both teams are interested in this concept and it could definitely make for a great joint project. For the moment, both teams have a lot on their plate and have other priorities, but it’s definitely being kept in mind on both sides.</p><p>The proposal hasn’t been voted on by the PIVX community yet, we will be giving out details when that happens. It will be interesting to see how this pans out!</p><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> <em>For clarity’s sake, PIVX transactions on the marketplace will still ultimately be converted into PART so that the marketplace can run its MAD escrow smart-contract and utilize the RingCT protocol offered by PART.</em></p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &amp; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"ledger-hardware-integration-is-here-\">Ledger Hardware Integration is Here!</h3><p><strong>Update [10–08–2018]: </strong><em>There is a known issue with setting up Ledger on Particl-Qt MacOS. Mac users should download Particl-Qt 0.16.2.0 (pre-release) by following this link:</em><em><strong> </strong></em><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.16.2.0\"><em>https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.16.2.0</em></a></p><p><strong>Update [10–08–2018]: </strong><em>The tutorial for cold staking from your Ledger Nano S is currently </em><em><strong>not available</strong></em><em>. Our team is working on figuring the best temporary solution to allow staking while the full Ledger integration onto Particl Desktop is completed. More details about both the tutorial and the Particl Desktop integration will be given out in further updates.</em></p><p><strong>Update [10–08–2018]: </strong><em>Your Particl balance will not show up on Ledger Live’s Portfolio interface. The Particl Ledger application currently only supports storing Particl on the Ledger Nano S and using the Particl features (staking, voting, transacting, etc). Ledger Live’s Portfolio may or may not come at a later time, this mostly depends on Ledger.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--4/1-ql_nYCy4FkvR35V2f9HolQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl, Bitcoin & PIVX on the Ledger Nano</figcaption></figure><p>After having submitted our own Ledger “<a href=\"https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005161545-List-of-supported-applications\">third-party application</a>” to <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/\">Ledger</a> weeks ago, it has finally been officially integrated into Ledger’s <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s\">Nano S hardware devices</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/pages/ledger-live\">Ledger Live</a>. That means you can now safely store your PART private keys on the Ledger Nano S device, dramatically increasing the security of your funds as well as the entire ecosystem. <strong>This also makes Particl the first pure Proof-of-Stake coin to offer hardware cold staking, or even just simply hardware staking</strong>.</p><blockquote>As a matter of fact, no matter how strong your passwords are or safely hidden your wallet files are, you are still putting yourself at great risk of getting hacked the moment you either enter a password or upload a wallet file on a computer or mobile device. Indeed, cryptocurrencies have become one of the prime targets for hackers and cyber thieves, and there are now several ways infected computers could result in the total loss of coins stored on unsafe wallets.<a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae\">— Particl Introduces Hardware Cold Staking</a><br>The <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/\">Ledger Nano S</a> is a hardware wallet, a special type of bitcoin wallet which stores the user’s private keys in a secure hardware device. They have major advantages over standard software wallets: private keys are stored in a secure chip, and cannot be transferred out of the device in plaintext. That means your funds are safe even when connected to an infected or malicious computer or a phishing/scam web page.<br>— <a href=\"http://particl.wiki/ledger\">Manage Particl on Ledger Nano S</a><br></blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--4/1-T2j6SkK4e2E6aO1sSELHKw.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Furthermore, we strongly believe those looking for the highest level of security shouldn’t be limited in what they can do on the Particl platform, especially as it relates to its governance (true democracy -&gt; no voice left unheard). As such, this Ledger integration is designed to be compatible with almost all, if not straight up all the functions of the Particl platform including, but not limited to, transacting funds, staking, voting and submitting proposals to the community as well as participating in the marketplace’s governance system without ever requiring to expose their private keys.</p><p>This announcement marks a very important step in Particl’s journey, demonstrating the team’s commitment to not only build the most secure blockchain solutions but to also deliver them in a perfectly accessible and flexible package that does not infringe on the user experience.</p><h3 id=\"decentralized-project-governance\">Decentralized Project Governance</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--4/1-PIFRczbnqdeXq5vQPKr4pg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\">We also posted this week about the new and improved decentralized project governance</a> that is nearing testnet implementation. In fact, we identified several issues with our legacy voting system (which has been on mainnet since Day 1) that makes it too restrictive in nature for what the Particl platform is aiming to do.</p><p>The main difference between the new governance system and the legacy one resides in the fact that any user will be able to vote for multiple proposals at the same time and do so directly from Particl Desktop regardless of if their funds are stored on a hot, cold, paper, or hardware wallet. We believe this update to the Project Governance system is a huge improvement both in terms of usability and democratic accurateness, and so we are very excited to run it through its final testing phase and to begin testnet integration.</p><p>We also announced in our <a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\">Decentralized Project Governance update</a> that there were a total of ~<a href=\"https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/address.dws?RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM.htm\">33,800 PART</a> left in the Community Initiative Fund and that we would be ready to initiate voting rounds on what to do with the funds once the Project Governance tool hits mainnet. As such, it could be a good idea to start thinking about proposals and ideas on how to best use the 33,800 PART that does belong to the community.</p><h3 id=\"particl-core-0-17-0-2-really-\">Particl Core 0.17.0.2…Really?!?</h3><p>For those keeping a close eye on Particl’s Github page, it may not come out as a surprise that <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert\">Tecnovert</a>, our Core Developer &amp; Cryptographic Researcher, has ALREADY started working on <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.0.2alpha\">Particl Core 0.17.0.2</a>. <em>TV </em>is known for being the fastest developer in the entire industry to adapt and merge the latest Bitcoin codebase into Particl Core whenever there is an update to it. Usually, it takes a few weeks, sometimes even days after the release. But this time, it seems like Tecnovert has been working overtime on 0.17, so it will be interesting to see if he has anything special under the hood or if he’s just being extremely diligent.</p><p>For a rough 0.17 release timeline from Bitcoin Core, please visit this link: <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/12624\">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/12624</a>.</p><h3 id=\"new-status-report\">New Status Report</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--4/1-lB2nJnMgGZApAI1E8Ueweg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p><a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\">We released on the third of August a new Status Report on our website</a>. This report is quite similar to our <a href=\"https://particl.news/new-status-report-released-8ca69930cfd\">previous Status Report</a> but also contains some new, exciting information about the state of Particl Marketplace development. Indeed, the “Wrapped Up” section of the report shows that a lot of items for the marketplace have been completed, including the Project Governance and Marketplace Governance tools. Some of the items marked as “Pending Review” have also been completed since we posted this report 7 days ago, including the <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae\">Ledger hardware integration</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2\">Particl Desktop 1.2.2</a> (currently on pre-release, mainnet).

Indeed, the project has reached a stage where our team has gained a lot of experience and have adapted their work methods to better organize and deliver more efficiently. That much can be seen on our Github with as much as 3 to 6 repositories being updated daily and by how fast items in our Status Report are getting hammered.</p><p>A lot of this can be attributed to our two new managers, Carmen and Vivienne, as well as the new<a href=\"https://linchpinseo.com/the-agile-method/\"> Agile methodologies</a> and strategies the team has established during its last meeting in Prague. It is worth noting that Github is <strong>only the tip of the iceberg</strong>, most of the development process and communications happening internally using <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira\"><strong>Jira</strong></a>.</p><p>As we are seeing a lot of items being marked as completed and as we keep hiring new developers such as our new Particl Desktop developer or any developer we will be hiring after the primary funding round, the Particl project is slowly entering into a new phase. We will soon reach a point where a lot of the pieces will start falling into place in a relatively short period of time while the development pace keeps increasing. Furthermore, the future release of our developer SDK should also attract many more “outside” developers contributing themselves to the accelerating development pace of the project. Simply put, we believe our best days are ahead of us and at arm’s length.</p><p><strong>Teaser: </strong>We will post next week a video demonstrating the impressive work our developers have put into Particl since we embarked on this journey a little more than a year ago.

As we are also heavily focused on security, we always prefer introducing features on testnet first, especially major updates such as the governance system and the RingCT protocol.

Keep an eye out for any future announcement of free merch being made available!</p><h3 id=\"is-there-any-update-about-the-pivx-alliance-conference-call\">Is there any update about the PIVX Alliance conference call?</h3><p>Yes, we had Imran, Ryno, and Cryptoguard participate in that call and we agreed with PIVX to submit a proposal to the PIVX community. The proposal states that PART would get listed on PIVX for free in exchange for a PIVX integration right into Particl Marketplace. The two social media teams would then help each other out with some cross-promotion campaign.</p><p>Both teams have also discussed doing a zPIV integration to Particl Marketplace, effectively allowing users to combine both Zerocoin and RingCT privacy protocols in a single transaction for the ultimate privacy package. This integration would, however, be a monster of itself. Both teams are interested in this concept and it could definitely make for a great joint project. For the moment, both teams have a lot on their plate and have other priorities, but it’s definitely being kept in mind on both sides.</p><p>The proposal hasn’t been voted on by the PIVX community yet, we will be giving out details when that happens. It will be interesting to see how this pans out!</p><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> <em>For clarity’s sake, PIVX transactions on the marketplace will still ultimately be converted into PART so that the marketplace can run its MAD escrow smart-contract and utilize the RingCT protocol offered by PART.</em></p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &#x26; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"ledger-hardware-integration-is-here-\">Ledger Hardware Integration is Here!</h3><p><strong>Update [10–08–2018]: </strong><em>There is a known issue with setting up Ledger on Particl-Qt MacOS. Mac users should download Particl-Qt 0.16.2.0 (pre-release) by following this link:</em><em><strong> </strong></em><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.16.2.0\"><em>https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.16.2.0</em></a></p><p><strong>Update [10–08–2018]: </strong><em>The tutorial for cold staking from your Ledger Nano S is currently </em><em><strong>not available</strong></em><em>. Our team is working on figuring the best temporary solution to allow staking while the full Ledger integration onto Particl Desktop is completed. More details about both the tutorial and the Particl Desktop integration will be given out in further updates.</em></p><p><strong>Update [10–08–2018]: </strong><em>Your Particl balance will not show up on Ledger Live’s Portfolio interface. The Particl Ledger application currently only supports storing Particl on the Ledger Nano S and using the Particl features (staking, voting, transacting, etc). Ledger Live’s Portfolio may or may not come at a later time, this mostly depends on Ledger.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--4/1-ql_nYCy4FkvR35V2f9HolQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl, Bitcoin &#x26; PIVX on the Ledger Nano</figcaption></figure><p>After having submitted our own Ledger “<a href=\"https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005161545-List-of-supported-applications\">third-party application</a>” to <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/\">Ledger</a> weeks ago, it has finally been officially integrated into Ledger’s <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s\">Nano S hardware devices</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/pages/ledger-live\">Ledger Live</a>. That means you can now safely store your PART private keys on the Ledger Nano S device, dramatically increasing the security of your funds as well as the entire ecosystem. <strong>This also makes Particl the first pure Proof-of-Stake coin to offer hardware cold staking, or even just simply hardware staking</strong>.</p><blockquote>As a matter of fact, no matter how strong your passwords are or safely hidden your wallet files are, you are still putting yourself at great risk of getting hacked the moment you either enter a password or upload a wallet file on a computer or mobile device. Indeed, cryptocurrencies have become one of the prime targets for hackers and cyber thieves, and there are now several ways infected computers could result in the total loss of coins stored on unsafe wallets.<a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae\">— Particl Introduces Hardware Cold Staking</a><br>The <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/\">Ledger Nano S</a> is a hardware wallet, a special type of bitcoin wallet which stores the user’s private keys in a secure hardware device. They have major advantages over standard software wallets: private keys are stored in a secure chip, and cannot be transferred out of the device in plaintext. That means your funds are safe even when connected to an infected or malicious computer or a phishing/scam web page.<br>— <a href=\"http://particl.wiki/ledger\">Manage Particl on Ledger Nano S</a><br></blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--4/1-T2j6SkK4e2E6aO1sSELHKw.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Furthermore, we strongly believe those looking for the highest level of security shouldn’t be limited in what they can do on the Particl platform, especially as it relates to its governance (true democracy -> no voice left unheard). As such, this Ledger integration is designed to be compatible with almost all, if not straight up all the functions of the Particl platform including, but not limited to, transacting funds, staking, voting and submitting proposals to the community as well as participating in the marketplace’s governance system without ever requiring to expose their private keys.</p><p>This announcement marks a very important step in Particl’s journey, demonstrating the team’s commitment to not only build the most secure blockchain solutions but to also deliver them in a perfectly accessible and flexible package that does not infringe on the user experience.</p><h3 id=\"decentralized-project-governance\">Decentralized Project Governance</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--4/1-PIFRczbnqdeXq5vQPKr4pg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\">We also posted this week about the new and improved decentralized project governance</a> that is nearing testnet implementation. In fact, we identified several issues with our legacy voting system (which has been on mainnet since Day 1) that makes it too restrictive in nature for what the Particl platform is aiming to do.</p><p>The main difference between the new governance system and the legacy one resides in the fact that any user will be able to vote for multiple proposals at the same time and do so directly from Particl Desktop regardless of if their funds are stored on a hot, cold, paper, or hardware wallet. We believe this update to the Project Governance system is a huge improvement both in terms of usability and democratic accurateness, and so we are very excited to run it through its final testing phase and to begin testnet integration.</p><p>We also announced in our <a href=\"https://particl.news/decentralized-project-governance-update-b8bd1ee0b1f6\">Decentralized Project Governance update</a> that there were a total of ~<a href=\"https://chainz.cryptoid.info/part/address.dws?RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM.htm\">33,800 PART</a> left in the Community Initiative Fund and that we would be ready to initiate voting rounds on what to do with the funds once the Project Governance tool hits mainnet. As such, it could be a good idea to start thinking about proposals and ideas on how to best use the 33,800 PART that does belong to the community.</p><h3 id=\"particl-core-0-17-0-2-really-\">Particl Core 0.17.0.2…Really?!?</h3><p>For those keeping a close eye on Particl’s Github page, it may not come out as a surprise that <a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert\">Tecnovert</a>, our Core Developer &#x26; Cryptographic Researcher, has ALREADY started working on <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.17.0.2alpha\">Particl Core 0.17.0.2</a>. <em>TV </em>is known for being the fastest developer in the entire industry to adapt and merge the latest Bitcoin codebase into Particl Core whenever there is an update to it. Usually, it takes a few weeks, sometimes even days after the release. But this time, it seems like Tecnovert has been working overtime on 0.17, so it will be interesting to see if he has anything special under the hood or if he’s just being extremely diligent.</p><p>For a rough 0.17 release timeline from Bitcoin Core, please visit this link: <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/12624\">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/12624</a>.</p><h3 id=\"new-status-report\">New Status Report</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--4/1-lB2nJnMgGZApAI1E8Ueweg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p><a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\">We released on the third of August a new Status Report on our website</a>. This report is quite similar to our <a href=\"https://particl.news/new-status-report-released-8ca69930cfd\">previous Status Report</a> but also contains some new, exciting information about the state of Particl Marketplace development. Indeed, the “Wrapped Up” section of the report shows that a lot of items for the marketplace have been completed, including the Project Governance and Marketplace Governance tools. Some of the items marked as “Pending Review” have also been completed since we posted this report 7 days ago, including the <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae\">Ledger hardware integration</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2\">Particl Desktop 1.2.2</a> (currently on pre-release, mainnet). A new Status Report should be posted soon and we will post an update here on <a href=\"http://particl.news\">particl.news</a>.</p><h3 id=\"development-is-at-an-all-time-high-\">Development is at an All-Time High!</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--4/1-5gzxYR-2F14bUso6Oer9tQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Jira</figcaption></figure><p>The development process of the Particl project has never been in such good shape. Indeed, the project has reached a stage where our team has gained a lot of experience and have adapted their work methods to better organize and deliver more efficiently. That much can be seen on our Github with as much as 3 to 6 repositories being updated daily and by how fast items in our Status Report are getting hammered.</p><p>A lot of this can be attributed to our two new managers, Carmen and Vivienne, as well as the new<a href=\"https://linchpinseo.com/the-agile-method/\"> Agile methodologies</a> and strategies the team has established during its last meeting in Prague. It is worth noting that Github is <strong>only the tip of the iceberg</strong>, most of the development process and communications happening internally using <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira\"><strong>Jira</strong></a>.</p><p>As we are seeing a lot of items being marked as completed and as we keep hiring new developers such as our new Particl Desktop developer or any developer we will be hiring after the primary funding round, the Particl project is slowly entering into a new phase. We will soon reach a point where a lot of the pieces will start falling into place in a relatively short period of time while the development pace keeps increasing. Furthermore, the future release of our developer SDK should also attract many more “outside” developers contributing themselves to the accelerating development pace of the project. Simply put, we believe our best days are ahead of us and at arm’s length.</p><p><strong>Teaser: </strong>We will post next week a video demonstrating the impressive work our developers have put into Particl since we embarked on this journey a little more than a year ago. This demonstration will be in the form of a Github contribution timeline and will help understand several factors associated with the development of an open-source project.

In fact, Albin, the owner of Mubiz, a decentralized marketplace gateway currently offering services for the OpenBazaar protocol, has been around the Particl project for some time, even being going as far back as the Shadowcash times. Turns out this entrepreneur has big plans for Particl!</p><p>With the desire to integrate Particl onto its decentralized marketplace gateway platform, Mubiz will undoubtedly become an enormous piece of the puzzle for Particl to go mainstream by offering a modern and responsive web &#x26; mobile interface (currently under FULL revamping) and by taking care of all the techy/geeky stuff like MAD escrow, crypto payments, customer support, and returns. Yes, you read that right!</p><p><strong>Stay tuned for this exclusive, ground-breaking interview where Albin will lay down his vision for Particl and decentralized marketplaces in general and explain exactly how he intends to make all the cryptocurrency and blockchain processes operate in the background, leaving users with a user-experience no different than any other web-based marketplace.

You can visit the website right now and already see that we have started merging some changes to it, currently mainly being focused on the header (more dynamic, more engaging).

Simply head over to this link and follow the\ninstructions: https://particl.wiki/ledger_staking. Note that, while the process\ncan currently only be executed from the Particl-Qt client, an actual Particl\nDesktop integration will be coming at a later time.\n\nUpdate [10–08–2018]: Your Particl balance will not show up on Ledger Live’s\nPortfolio interface. The Particl Ledger application currently only supports\nstoring Particl on the Ledger Nano S and using the Particl features (staking,\nvoting, transacting, etc). Ledger Live’s Portfolio may or may not come at a\nlater time, this mostly depends on Ledger.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe are very excited to finally announce that as of today, Ledger has officially\nadded support for Particl on their Ledger Live application and Nano S device.\nThis means PART will now be available for cold storage on Nano S hardware\nwallets with cold staking capabilities enabled. This release marks the first\ntime pure PoS coins stored on a hardware device can be safely staked without any\nintermediary nor internet connection required.\n\nTo learn how to use Particl on the Ledger Nano S, follow this simple tutorial on\nour Wiki page: https://particl.wiki/ledger\n\nThe Most Secure Way to Store PART\nNo matter how strong your passwords are or safely hidden your wallet files are,\nyou are still putting yourself at great risk of getting hacked the moment you\neither enter a password or upload a wallet file on a computer or mobile device.\nIndeed, cryptocurrencies have become one of the prime targets for hackers and\ncyber thieves, and there are now several ways infected computers could result in\nthe total loss of coins stored on unsafe wallets.\n\nThe Ledged Nano S hardware deviceThe Ledger Nano S [https://www.ledger.com/] is a hardware wallet, a special type\nof cryptocurrency wallet which stores the user’s private keys in a secure\nhardware device. They have major advantages over standard software wallets:\nprivate keys are stored in a protected area of a micro-controller, and cannot be\ntransferred out of the device in plaintext. That means your funds are safe even\nwhen connected to an infected or malicious computer or a phishing/scam web page.\n\nThe World’s Most Secure PoS Protocol\nA vulnerability often associated with PoS is the risk associated with the\nprocess of staking itself. In fact, Proof-of-Stake protocols usually require\nusers to keep their wallets online and “unlocked for staking”. While wallets in\nthat state are still locked and require a password to execute transactions, this\nvery password is stored in the device’s memory so that it can remain “unlocked\nfor staking”. As we’ve seen with the Spectre and Meltdown exploits earlier this\nyear\n[https://particl.news/particls-cold-staking-puts-meltdown-spectre-exploit-on-ice-3c8c05f90870]\n, storing any password in memory is a huge security risk which could easily\nresult in the loss of coins if abused against PoS coin users.\n\nThis issue was fixed in 2017 when Particl released cold staking. In fact, cold\nstaking lets users delegate their staking powers to cold staking nodes which\ncontain no coin but can sign and stake blocks on behalf of any other address,\neven coins stored “offline” on hardware devices, paper wallets or cold wallets.\nThese staking nodes do not require to be operated by any third-party other than\nthe end user itself and can be set up quite easily by anyone. Practically, what\nthis means is that users do not need to keep the funds they wish to stake\nexposed on hot wallets with the password stored in memory as that responsibility\nis assumed by the cold staking nodes (which do not contain any coin and can be\nleft unencrypted).\n\nThe Ultimate Vulnerability\nHowever, cold staking as it was currently standing was still leaving Particl\nstakers vulnerable to one final attack vector: transacting on infected\ncomputers. Indeed, even though the cold staking process is very secure, it alone\ndoes not fix the ultimate vulnerability that is an infected device. No matter\nhow secure the staking process is, users still need to execute transactions to\neither spend or sell their staking rewards or rearrange their setup. That means\nprivate keys still need to ultimately be exposed in plain text, even if only for\na brief moment. With cryptocurrencies increasingly becoming a prime target for\nhackers and cyber thieves\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-crime/about-1-2-billion-in-cryptocurrency-stolen-since-2017-cybercrime-group-idUSKCN1IP2LU]\n, the possibility of a device getting infected without its owner even being\naware of it becomes greater. That is even more true as more and more\nvulnerabilities and exploits surrounding the ME Intel chip keep making headlines\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-me-new-firmware-bugs,37492.html].\n\n> Between all the new Spectre-class CPU flaws and the bugs the company and other\nresearchers keep finding for its Management Engine (ME) firmware, Intel can’t\nseem to catch a break. Now the company has publicly disclosed two more ME bugs,\none of which allows remote code execution on victims’ PCs.\nThe ME Intel chip\n[https://boingboing.net/2016/06/15/intel-x86-processors-ship-with.html] is a\nproprietary engine that powers hardware features that operate at the baseboard\nlevel, below the operating system. By enabling interaction with low-level\nhardware, this chip gives administrators (or any user that can find practical\nexploits) the ability to perform tasks that previously required someone to be\nphysically present at the desktop. The EFF itself describes the ME Intel chip\n[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/05/intels-management-engine-security-hazard-and-users-need-way-disable-it] \nas a “largely undocumented master controller for your CPU: it works with system\nfirmware during boot and has direct access to system memory, the screen,\nkeyboard, and network”.\n\nSimply put, transacting any coin, PoS or PoW, is something that is exponentially\nbecoming riskier as hackers get more experience in the crypto industry and\nimprove their techniques.\n\nHardware Cold Staking to the Rescue\nSecure Staking Brings Peace of MindThis is where the significance of this Ledger\nNano S integration comes into play as it is coded in such a way that no private\nkey needs to be exchanged between the Ledger Nano S hardware device and the\nclient (Particl-Qt). This means that users will now be able to store funds\nstored on a hardware device and still delegate the hardware wallet’s staking\npowers to a cold staking node.\n\nThis release, as it currently stands, is the first ever successful mainnet\nrelease of a pure PoS hardware cold staking setup, the ultimate solution for\nusers looking at getting the best level of security, flexibility, and\naccessibility without compromising decentralization. You know, when they say you \n“can’t have your cake and it eat too”, well it turns out with Particl you now\ncan!\n\nSecure Decentralized Voting Process\nDecentralized Project GovernanceThis Ledger Nano S integration currently only\nallow users to securely store and stake their funds offline on a hardware\ndevice, but it will also ultimately let users participate in both governance\nmechanisms available on Particl. Indeed, with a bit of additional work, users\nwill be able to use their coins stored on their hardware device to participate\nin both governance system without ever requiring to expose their private key or\npassword on the computer used to register their vote. This ensures that ALL\nParticl users, even those with the highest security standards, can partake in\nthe decentralized governance of the project and its platform. No voice left\nunheard!\n\nExciting Times Lie Ahead\nThis release marks the start of an exciting period for the Particl project as we\nwill start seeing more and more features hit both the testnet and mainnet\nnetworks. After a year or so of being in a deep development phase, the pieces\nare finally starting to come all together leading up to the release of the\nlong-awaited Particl Marketplace on mainnet.\n\nAs a matter of fact, ever since the team meeting in Prague, the team has adopted\nnew, better development and management processes and methodologies and has never\nbeen as effective as it currently is. That much can be noticed directly on our\nGithub page where activity has been soaring and commits are pouring in. It can\nsafely be stated that the development aspect of the project is currently at its\nbest and has never been as steady and effective as it currently is.\n\nContest\nTo celebrate this new security feature, we would like to give away 5 Ledger Nano\nS hardware devices to our community! As such, we will be making various contests\nwhich are separated among our different platforms:\n\nTwitter: To participate in this Twitter contest, follow the instructions written\nin our contest tweet\n[http://Welcome%20to%20our%20#giveaway%20channel!%20This%20is%20where%20we%20will%20be%20doing%20many%20giveaways%20with%20the%20help%20of%20the%20GiveawayBot%20moving%20forwards.%20Our%20first%20Discord%20giveaway%20is%20about%20the%20Ledger%20Nano%20S,%20and%20we%20will%20be%20giving%20away%20two%20of%20them%20%28brand%20new,%20shipping%20from%20Ledger%20directly%29%20to%20two%20random%20winners.%20To%20participate,%20just%20react%20:tada:%20to%20the%20post%20above.%20%20For%20an%20additional%20chance%20to%20win%20a%20Ledger,%20we%20are%20also%20having%20a%20Twitter%20contest%20where%203%20winners%20will%20be%20randomly%20picked.%20Simply%20follow%20the%20instructions%20written%20in%20this%20tweet:%20https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1026864584777510912] \nand tag your favorite personality within the cryptocurrency community in the\ncomment section of the tweet to give them a head’s up about this news!

Indeed, cryptocurrencies have become one of the prime targets for hackers and cyber thieves, and there are now several ways infected computers could result in the total loss of coins stored on unsafe wallets.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-Introduces-Hardware-Cold-Staking/1-o-lz1vGSH1_ABPtV3Bc8zQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>The Ledged Nano S hardware device</figcaption></figure><p>The <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/\">Ledger Nano S</a> is a hardware wallet, a special type of cryptocurrency wallet which stores the user’s private keys in a secure hardware device. They have major advantages over standard software wallets: private keys are stored in a protected area of a micro-controller, and cannot be transferred out of the device in plaintext. That means your funds are safe even when connected to an infected or malicious computer or a phishing/scam web page.</p><h3 id=\"the-world-s-most-secure-pos-protocol\">The World’s Most Secure PoS Protocol</h3><p>A vulnerability often associated with PoS is the risk associated with the process of staking itself. In fact, Proof-of-Stake protocols usually require users to keep their wallets online and “unlocked for staking”. While wallets in that state are still locked and require a password to execute transactions, this very password is stored in the device’s memory so that it can remain “unlocked for staking”. As we’ve seen with the <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-cold-staking-puts-meltdown-spectre-exploit-on-ice-3c8c05f90870\">Spectre and Meltdown exploits earlier this year</a>, storing any password in memory is a huge security risk which could easily result in the loss of coins if abused against PoS coin users.</p><p>This issue was fixed in 2017 when Particl released cold staking. In fact, cold staking lets users delegate their staking powers to cold staking nodes which contain no coin but can sign and stake blocks on behalf of any other address, even coins stored “offline” on hardware devices, paper wallets or cold wallets. These staking nodes do not require to be operated by any third-party other than the end user itself and can be set up quite easily by anyone. Practically, what this means is that users do not need to keep the funds they wish to stake exposed on hot wallets with the password stored in memory as that responsibility is assumed by the cold staking nodes (which do not contain any coin and can be left unencrypted).</p><h3 id=\"the-ultimate-vulnerability\">The Ultimate Vulnerability</h3><p>However, cold staking as it was currently standing was still leaving Particl stakers vulnerable to one final attack vector: transacting on infected computers. Indeed, even though the cold staking process is very secure, it alone does not fix the ultimate vulnerability that is an infected device. No matter how secure the staking process is, users still need to execute transactions to either spend or sell their staking rewards or rearrange their setup. That means private keys still need to ultimately be exposed in plain text, even if only for a brief moment. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-crime/about-1-2-billion-in-cryptocurrency-stolen-since-2017-cybercrime-group-idUSKCN1IP2LU\">With cryptocurrencies increasingly becoming a prime target for hackers and cyber thieves</a>, the possibility of a device getting infected without its owner even being aware of it becomes greater. That is even more true as <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-me-new-firmware-bugs,37492.html\">more and more vulnerabilities and exploits surrounding the ME Intel chip keep making headlines</a>.</p><blockquote>Between all the new Spectre-class CPU flaws and the bugs the company and other researchers keep finding for its Management Engine (ME) firmware, Intel can’t seem to catch a break.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]Following last week's release\nof the MVP for multi-net capabilities using Simplex as the first alternative\nnetwork, we've identified several Simplex-specific issues that we're currently\nworking to resolve.\n\nDue to Simplex's complex and intricate network architecture, these issues are\nproving challenging to address, requiring additional development time.
