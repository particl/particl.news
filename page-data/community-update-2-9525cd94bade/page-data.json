We’ve got your back with our\nbi-weekly community and project update!\n\nThanks to our community member CryptoBeans for preparing most of the notes for\nthis update!\n\nLivestream Summary\nTeam Meetings\nTaking a break at the end of the day!Most of the core Particl developers met in\nPrague during the last week of June for a series of project meetings focused on\nthe planning and development of the roadmap items for the second half of the\nyear and moving forward. A particular focus was put on both the project and\nmarketplace governance systems as well as the integration of the multi-wallet\nfeature into Particl Desktop. Moving from Electron to Muon was also discussed\nduring that time.\n\nTo conclude this week full of meetings, Ryno Mathee, Particl’s Lead Developer,\njoined last week’s livestream to give a summary of what was discussed as well as\nan update on the status of the project and assist Paul to answer questions from\nthe community.\n\nProject & Marketplace Governance\nRyno gave out a lot of information about the governance systems that are going\nto be integrated into the platform.\n\n * The team has settled and specified on initial governance models for the\n   marketplace and the project. The user flow has been completed.\n * The initial marketplace governance model is very basic and simple to begin\n   with and will evolve with time.\n * Martin and CRZ, our two UI/UX lead developers, have started building the\n   wireframes for the in-wallet integrations of these systems.\n * The marketplace governance system is going to be a system based on reporting\n   as opposed to an approval model. This will make the user experience much\n   smoother by not forcing users to execute mandatory, extra steps.\n * When a listing reaches a certain flag threshold, its data is blacklisted by\n   the Particl Desktop client. This blacklist is then shared amongst all clients\n   connected to the network so that the ban may be effective worldwide.\n * Listings data is hosted on SMSG, Particl’s messaging system. When a listing\n   is blacklisted, the message on which the listing data is hosted is\n   blacklisted by the clients. The message itself is not removed from the\n   blockchain although it will be ignored by Particl Desktop on each client’s\n   side.\n * When a listing is blacklisted, its listing fee is NOT refunded back to the\n   vendor.\n * Although the initial governance model (v1) will be very simple and not\n   necessarily based on staking weight, the second iteration of it (v2) will be.\n   The bigger your staking weight, the more influence you have over the\n   governance system. Note that the second iteration of the marketplace\n   governance model is planned for the Beta.\n * Each time a listing is flagged, the votes are once again tallied so that\n   users cannot flag listings, move their coins around and then flag the same\n   listing again.\n\nRingCT\nThere have also been a few updates about the RingCT protocol that has been under\nacademic review for the last 6 months by assistant-professor Qiang Tang from\nthe\nNJIT Department of Technology [https://web.njit.edu/~qiang/].\n\n * The academic review of Particl’s implementation of the RingCT privacy\n   protocol on top of the latest Bitcoin codebase is now complete.\n * Our lead cryptographer and Particl Core developer, Tecnovert, is now in\n   possession of the academic report and is reviewing it. Paul and Ryno will\n   soon receive a report from Tecnovert about it, and more information will be\n   made available at that point.\n * The NJIT intends on producing and publishing an academic paper on their\n   research on Particl’s implementation of the RingCT privacy protocol.\n\nWeSecureApp * The WSA Cyber Group [https://wesecureapp.com/#] will then perform a full\n   RingCT code audit. They have been put under contract to fully audit the\n   RingCT code. This process has already started and is estimated to require\n   around 100 hours of work. Please note this does not constitute a deadline,\n   only a rough estimate.\n * While bulletproofs, the protocol that is poised to reduce RingCT &\n   CT transaction sizes by around ~80%, is part of our roadmap, it’s mainnet\n   implementation is not an immediate priority. As we are heavily focused on not\n   only privacy but also security, and as the bulletproofs protocol is still\n   very new and hasn’t been tested in a live environment that much, we believe\n   there is still a lot of research, review and audits required before it can be\n   considered safe enough for our users.\n\nMarketplace\nAs the Particl Marketplace Alpha\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases] is still being improved\nand tested by the community every day, there were a few questions about it as\nwell as some comments and updates from both Paul and Ryno.\n\n * Paul mentioned that as he processed the orders for our free t-shirt promotion\n   on the alpha, he realized just how much the messaging feature needs to be\n   added to Particl Desktop and integrated into the marketplace. Note that the\n   messaging system is already live on mainnet and is used by the marketplace to\n   store data. It can be used by anyone to message anyone else using particl-cli\n   but is not available in a graphical interface.\n * As our free t-shirt promotion has been a success, it is planned to make\n   available more free goodies, including shirts with some of the designs from\n   our t-shirt contest winners\n   [https://particl.news/t-shirt-contest-winning-designs-5460d5d34ec5], to the\n   Particl community as we release new marketplace alpha updates. Stay tuned!\n * Private listings live within private markets. Private markets are hidden\n   marketplaces that can only be accessed by entering a custom link or key into\n   Particl Desktop. They do not appear within the public interface of the\n   marketplace.\n * The team is still discussing the best approach to have the community govern\n   private marketplaces. It is likely these hidden marketplaces may fall into\n   the same governance system with the extra ability to blacklist entire\n   marketplaces (TBC).\n\nParticl Foundation\nDuring the same week the Particl team met for a series of meetings in Prague, a\nParticl Foundation meeting was held in Switzerland, which Ryno of course\nattended. Here are a few updates and answers to some of the community questions\nrelated to the Foundation.\n\n * The Foundation should release its Q2 2018 financial report during the second\n   or third week of July. It will be available, as always, on the Particl\n   Foundation website [http://particl.foundation/financial-reports].\n * The primary funding round hasn’t been discussed during these meetings. It is\n   planned for being discussed and planned the next time the team will meet, in\n   September 2018.\n\nLedger\nAs part of our roadmap, we intend on being fully integrated onto the Ledger\nwallet, a hardware wallet acting as a secure cold storage option for Bitcoin as\nwell as some other coins.\n\n * It is already possible to use the Ledger wallet to securely store PART,\n   however, that process is not really user-friendly and only recommended for\n   advanced users. There is currently no native option for PART on Ledger’s\n   interface.\n * Particl’s integration into the Ledger interface is now complete.\n   [https://github.com/particl/blue-app-btc/commit/7777f4770d60fdbd4dc3f0d0f6f4c856db826482] \n   The Ledger team now needs to accept Particl’s pull request on Github.\n * The current Particl integration into the Ledger wallet only works with public\n   transactions. Adding RingCT and CT capabilities to our Ledger integration is\n   part of our roadmap but not the immediate focus.\n\nOther Questions Asked During the Livestream\nThere are quite a few other questions that were asked by the Particl community\nto both Ryno and Paul.\n\nRyno answering some of the Particl community questions * When asked where he\n   sees Particl in a year’s time, Ryno mentioned that he does not want the\n   marketplace to be a ghost town. As such, the team is fully committed to\n   developing a smooth and seamless user-experience accessible to all types of\n   users. It is also expected that as we draw closer to a mainnet release of the\n   marketplace, a lot of efforts will be spent attracting users by clearly\n   communicating all the advantages of a private-by-design and decentralized\n   eCommerce environment. He also expects the team to keep growing in number,\n   talent, and experience.\n * When asked about other\n   dApps currently being developed on Particl, it was confirmed that nothing is\n   in the works as it relates to the official Particl team. Paul speculated\n   about possible alternative versions to the marketplace he would personally\n   enjoy seeing being developed in the future such as wanted ads, penny\n   auctions, bidding options, coin swaps, and etc.\n * Within the Particl\n   community itself, this question had a lot of users envisioning their own wish\n   list of private-by-design dApps built on Particl. There were a lot of good\n   ideas being thrown around such as decentralized social media dApps,\n   gambling/casino dApps, video streaming dApps (with one streaming dApp\n   allegedly currently under development by an anonymous community member\n   [https://pastebin.com/raw/eMUSxLaA]), and etc. One thing is for sure; the\n   idea of private-by-design dApps is a very exciting prospect that is poised to\n   dramatically improve several industries.\n * Ryno was asked about\n   the nature of the delays in regards to the release of the alpha version of\n   the marketplace. Ryno mentioned these delays caused the team to rethink parts\n   of its organizational process and act on improving it. He mentioned that as\n   the team rapidly grew, the scoping did not go into enough details. There is\n   now much more documentation being made by the team so that each Particl\n   developer can more effectively work in sync with their peers. Agile\n   methodologies are now also being put into practice, and two new development\n   managers (Carmen and Vivienne) have been hired\n   [https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-6-new-team-members-7cc38f92e5c5]. It\n   was mentioned that the team now uses the more effective Jira software for\n   issue tracking as opposed to Github and that bi-weekly internal reports are\n   now also being produced. This should be reflected soon in Particl’s status\n   reports [http://particl.io/status-report].\n\nBi-Weekly Recap\nThere is a lot going on with Particl at the moment, and the last two weeks have\nbeen quite eventful for the project.\n\nParticl Team is Expanding\nOn the 27th of June, we introduced 6 new team members\n[https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-6-new-team-members-7cc38f92e5c5] \nincluding three managers and three developers. Carmen and Vivienne, our two new\ndevelopment managers, are going to be key assets in not only improving our\norganizational processes but also creating a scalable environment where new\ndevelopers can easily be integrated within the project and quickly be put up to\nspeed with our methods. Expect the team to keep growing as we move forward!\n\nDuring last week’s livestream, it was also announced that a new lead developer\nfor Particl Desktop would be joining the Particl team in August of this year.\nThis developer is yet to be introduced to the community and hasn’t been included\nin the 6 new team members blog post.\n\nPartaker Hub\nTop 10 Partaker Hub leaderboard, by the total of completed orders.The Partaker\nHub has been a tremendous success in building a dedicated community of\ncontributors. Managed by one of our new team member, Particl Partaker, the Hub\nis now home to 117 partakers, a pretty impressive figure considering that it\nwas\nlaunched only three weeks ago\n[https://particl.news/the-partaker-hub-goes-live-on-friday-d5f3d5bffbc4].\n\nWe’d like to take this opportunity to thank all the partakers who are helping in\nspreading the word about this project. We’d also like to give a special shoutout\nto encoreforreal, our top partaker, which has completed a mind-blowing total of\n146 tasks.\n\nDuring these past three weeks, running the Hub has been a learning experience\nfor all involved, partakers and administrators alike. We are still learning and\nexperimenting to find the most effective strategies in spreading the Particl\nmessage through organic word-of-mouth.\n\nAs such, we are currently working on setting up an official forum that will be\nlinked to both the Partaker Hub and our Discord server. We strongly believe that\nusing and linking these three platforms together will greatly improve the\nresults of each partaker’s work as well as improve the options available for our\ncommunity to communicate with each others. An official blog post with more\ndetails about these new developments should be coming out soon.\n\nCommunity Meetup\nFollowing the week of meetings, the Particl team held a meetup\n[https://particl.news/an-evening-with-the-particl-developers-d000e029c3de] for\ncommunity members to come and chat with the team around a few drinks and snacks.\nThe meetup was hosted at Paralelni Polis, a small crypto-friendly cafe in Prague\nthat only accepts cryptocurrencies. We had a lot of fun discussing with some of\nour fans and would like to give a shoutout to George Ouzounidis (JammingShirts)\nfrom TShirtPrinting [http://tshirtprinting.gr/], a long-time supporter of the\nproject, for bringing some of his very own Particl-themed merchandise and\noffering them as gifts!\n\nNew Particl Core Update\nYesterday, we updated Particl Core to the latest Bitcoin Core codebase version\n(0.16.1.0). While this is a relatively minor update, it furthers our vision of\nalways staying up-to-date with the latest version of the Bitcoin Core codebase\nand is an all-around good practice that ensures a secure and stable experience\nfor our users.\n\nIf you are using Particl Desktop, your Core will update automatically. You will,\nhowever, need to manually update your core if you are using Particl-qt or\nParticl-cli. Note that cold staking nodes do not automatically update their core\nbut will ask you to do it the next time you input a command into it. The update\ncan be downloaded and installed directly from the cold staking smart-contract.\nNot updating your core will not disable staking or put your wallet offline, but\nit is strongly recommended to always update to the latest version of Particl\nCore for security and stability reasons.\n\nNote that if upgrading from version 0.16.0.5 or below, this release will\nautomatically reindex the blockchain the first time it’s run. Downgrading to a\nversion before 0.16.0.6 will require a chain reindex to be manually initiated.\n\nNew Official Blog Posts\nThere has been a lot of news and updates being posted on our blog these past two\nweeks!\n\n * First Alpha Particl Marketplace products begin shipping!\n   [https://particl.news/first-alpha-particl-marketplace-products-begin-shipping-6974308e0441]\n * Particl welcomes 6 new team members!\n   [https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-6-new-team-members-7cc38f92e5c5]\n * Guide: How to Use the Partaker Hub\n   [https://particl.news/guide-how-to-use-the-partaker-hub-5283fb504e66]\n * PART now available for swapping on Mycelium\n   [https://particl.news/part-now-available-on-mycelium-6215993ef20a]\n * RELEASE: Particl Core 0.16.1.0\n   [https://particl.news/release-particl-core-0-16-1-0-7c10428f0515]\n\nNew CryptoRamble Videos\nDesi-Rae continues her great work in producing quality videos on not only\nParticl but also privacy, security as well as crypto in general.

Carmen and Vivienne, our two new development managers, are going to be key assets in not only improving our organizational processes but also creating a scalable environment where new developers can easily be integrated within the project and quickly be put up to speed with our methods. Expect the team to keep growing as we move forward!</p><p>During last week’s livestream, it was also announced that a new lead developer for Particl Desktop would be joining the Particl team in August of this year. This developer is yet to be introduced to the community and hasn’t been included in the 6 new team members blog post.</p><h3 id=\"partaker-hub\">Partaker Hub</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--2/1-hk3ogNBwA1tDap_t2WDTDw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Top 10 Partaker Hub leaderboard, by the total of completed orders.</figcaption></figure><p>The Partaker Hub has been a tremendous success in building a dedicated community of contributors. Managed by one of our new team member, Particl Partaker, the Hub is now home to 117 partakers, a pretty impressive figure considering that <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-partaker-hub-goes-live-on-friday-d5f3d5bffbc4\">it was launched only three weeks ago</a>.</p><p>We’d like to take this opportunity to thank all the partakers who are helping in spreading the word about this project. We’d also like to give a special shoutout to encoreforreal, our top partaker, which has completed a mind-blowing total of 146 tasks.</p><p>During these past three weeks, running the Hub has been a learning experience for all involved, partakers and administrators alike. We are still learning and experimenting to find the most effective strategies in spreading the Particl message through organic word-of-mouth.</p><p>As such, we are currently working on setting up an official forum that will be linked to both the Partaker Hub and our Discord server. We strongly believe that using and linking these three platforms together will greatly improve the results of each partaker’s work as well as improve the options available for our community to communicate with each others. An official blog post with more details about these new developments should be coming out soon.</p><h3 id=\"community-meetup\">Community Meetup</h3><p>Following the week of meetings, the Particl team <a href=\"https://particl.news/an-evening-with-the-particl-developers-d000e029c3de\">held a meetup</a> for community members to come and chat with the team around a few drinks and snacks. The meetup was hosted at Paralelni Polis, a small crypto-friendly cafe in Prague that only accepts cryptocurrencies. We had a lot of fun discussing with some of our fans and would like to give a shoutout to George Ouzounidis (JammingShirts) from <a href=\"http://tshirtprinting.gr/\">TShirtPrinting</a>, a long-time supporter of the project, for bringing some of his very own Particl-themed merchandise and offering them as gifts!</p><h3 id=\"new-particl-core-update\">New Particl Core Update</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--2/1-Z9ugBVnUoCv5Uo-7z4xHiw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Yesterday, we updated Particl Core to the latest Bitcoin Core codebase version (0.16.1.0). While this is a relatively minor update, it furthers our vision of always staying up-to-date with the latest version of the Bitcoin Core codebase and is an all-around good practice that ensures a secure and stable experience for our users.</p><p>If you are using Particl Desktop, your Core will update automatically. You will, however, need to manually update your core if you are using Particl-qt or Particl-cli. Note that cold staking nodes do not automatically update their core but will ask you to do it the next time you input a command into it. The update can be downloaded and installed directly from the cold staking smart-contract. Not updating your core will not disable staking or put your wallet offline, but it is strongly recommended to always update to the latest version of Particl Core for security and stability reasons.</p><p>Note that if upgrading from version 0.16.0.5 or below, this release will automatically reindex the blockchain the first time it’s run. Downgrading to a version before 0.16.0.6 will require a chain reindex to be manually initiated.</p><h3 id=\"new-official-blog-posts\">New Official Blog Posts</h3><p>There has been a lot of news and updates being posted on our blog these past two weeks!</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/first-alpha-particl-marketplace-products-begin-shipping-6974308e0441\">First Alpha Particl Marketplace products begin shipping!</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-6-new-team-members-7cc38f92e5c5\">Particl welcomes 6 new team members!</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/guide-how-to-use-the-partaker-hub-5283fb504e66\">Guide: How to Use the Partaker Hub</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/part-now-available-on-mycelium-6215993ef20a\">PART now available for swapping on Mycelium</a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/release-particl-core-0-16-1-0-7c10428f0515\">RELEASE: Particl Core 0.16.1.0</a></li></ul><h3 id=\"new-cryptoramble-videos\">New CryptoRamble Videos</h3><p>Desi-Rae continues her great work in producing quality videos on not only Particl but also privacy, security as well as crypto in general.

A particular focus was put on both the project and marketplace governance systems as well as the integration of the multi-wallet feature into Particl Desktop. Moving from Electron to Muon was also discussed during that time.</p><p>To conclude this week full of meetings, Ryno Mathee, Particl’s Lead Developer, joined last week’s livestream to give a summary of what was discussed as well as an update on the status of the project and assist Paul to answer questions from the community.</p><h3 id=\"project-marketplace-governance\">Project &#x26; Marketplace Governance</h3><p>Ryno gave out a lot of information about the governance systems that are going to be integrated into the platform.</p><ul><li>The team has settled and specified on initial governance models for the marketplace and the project. The user flow has been completed.</li><li>The initial marketplace governance model is very basic and simple to begin with and will evolve with time.</li><li>Martin and CRZ, our two UI/UX lead developers, have started building the wireframes for the in-wallet integrations of these systems.</li><li>The marketplace governance system is going to be a system based on reporting as opposed to an approval model. This will make the user experience much smoother by not forcing users to execute mandatory, extra steps.</li><li>When a listing reaches a certain flag threshold, its data is blacklisted by the Particl Desktop client. This blacklist is then shared amongst all clients connected to the network so that the ban may be effective worldwide.</li><li>Listings data is hosted on SMSG, Particl’s messaging system. When a listing is blacklisted, the message on which the listing data is hosted is blacklisted by the clients. The message itself is not removed from the blockchain although it will be ignored by Particl Desktop on each client’s side.</li><li>When a listing is blacklisted, its listing fee is NOT refunded back to the vendor.</li><li>Although the initial governance model (v1) will be very simple and not necessarily based on staking weight, the second iteration of it (v2) will be. The bigger your staking weight, the more influence you have over the governance system. Note that the second iteration of the marketplace governance model is planned for the Beta.</li><li>Each time a listing is flagged, the votes are once again tallied so that users cannot flag listings, move their coins around and then flag the same listing again.</li></ul><h3 id=\"ringct\">RingCT</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--2/1-QeptxWMrevjZX2HigZVhhg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>There have also been a few updates about the RingCT protocol that has been under academic review for the last 6 months by <a href=\"https://web.njit.edu/~qiang/\">assistant-professor Qiang Tang from the NJIT Department of Technology</a>.</p><ul><li>The academic review of Particl’s implementation of the RingCT privacy protocol on top of the latest Bitcoin codebase is now complete.</li><li>Our lead cryptographer and Particl Core developer, Tecnovert, is now in possession of the academic report and is reviewing it. Paul and Ryno will soon receive a report from Tecnovert about it, and more information will be made available at that point.</li><li>The NJIT intends on producing and publishing an academic paper on their research on Particl’s implementation of the RingCT privacy protocol.</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--2/1-2AsxZ8uoxIj2CWNRb_p_Fw@2x.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>WeSecureApp</figcaption></figure><ul><li>The <a href=\"https://wesecureapp.com/#\">WSA Cyber Group</a> will then perform a full RingCT code audit. They have been put under contract to fully audit the RingCT code. This process has already started and is estimated to require around 100 hours of work. Please note this does not constitute a deadline, only a rough estimate.</li><li>While bulletproofs, the protocol that is poised to reduce RingCT &#x26; CT transaction sizes by around ~80%, is part of our roadmap, it’s mainnet implementation is not an immediate priority. As we are heavily focused on not only privacy but also security, and as the bulletproofs protocol is still very new and hasn’t been tested in a live environment that much, we believe there is still a lot of research, review and audits required before it can be considered safe enough for our users.</li></ul><h3 id=\"marketplace\">Marketplace</h3><p>As the <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases\">Particl Marketplace Alpha</a> is still being improved and tested by the community every day, there were a few questions about it as well as some comments and updates from both Paul and Ryno.</p><ul><li>Paul mentioned that as he processed the orders for our free t-shirt promotion on the alpha, he realized just how much the messaging feature needs to be added to Particl Desktop and integrated into the marketplace. Note that the messaging system is already live on mainnet and is used by the marketplace to store data. It can be used by anyone to message anyone else using particl-cli but is not available in a graphical interface.</li><li>As our free t-shirt promotion has been a success, it is planned to make available more free goodies, including shirts with some of the <a href=\"https://particl.news/t-shirt-contest-winning-designs-5460d5d34ec5\">designs from our t-shirt contest winners</a>, to the Particl community as we release new marketplace alpha updates. Stay tuned!</li><li>Private listings live within private markets. Private markets are hidden marketplaces that can only be accessed by entering a custom link or key into Particl Desktop. They do not appear within the public interface of the marketplace.</li><li>The team is still discussing the best approach to have the community govern private marketplaces. It is likely these hidden marketplaces may fall into the same governance system with the extra ability to blacklist entire marketplaces (TBC).</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-foundation\">Particl Foundation</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--2/1-NcRxl0LrPXpYZ2ybQx2Wmw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>During the same week the Particl team met for a series of meetings in Prague, a Particl Foundation meeting was held in Switzerland, which Ryno of course attended. Here are a few updates and answers to some of the community questions related to the Foundation.</p><ul><li>The Foundation should release its Q2 2018 financial report during the second or third week of July. It will be available, as always, on the <a href=\"http://particl.foundation/financial-reports\">Particl Foundation website</a>.</li><li>The primary funding round hasn’t been discussed during these meetings. It is planned for being discussed and planned the next time the team will meet, in September 2018.</li></ul><h3 id=\"ledger\">Ledger</h3><p>As part of our roadmap, we intend on being fully integrated onto the Ledger wallet, a hardware wallet acting as a secure cold storage option for Bitcoin as well as some other coins.</p><ul><li>It is already possible to use the Ledger wallet to securely store PART, however, that process is not really user-friendly and only recommended for advanced users. There is currently no native option for PART on Ledger’s interface.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/blue-app-btc/commit/7777f4770d60fdbd4dc3f0d0f6f4c856db826482\">Particl’s integration into the Ledger interface is now complete.</a> The Ledger team now needs to accept Particl’s pull request on Github.</li><li>The current Particl integration into the Ledger wallet only works with public transactions. Adding RingCT and CT capabilities to our Ledger integration is part of our roadmap but not the immediate focus.</li></ul><h3 id=\"other-questions-asked-during-the-livestream\">Other Questions Asked During the Livestream</h3><p>There are quite a few other questions that were asked by the Particl community to both Ryno and Paul.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--2/1-rvUyAEMi_0RTxb8o3jg08g.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Ryno answering some of the Particl community questions</figcaption></figure><ul><li>When asked where he sees Particl in a year’s time, Ryno mentioned that he does not want the marketplace to be a ghost town. As such, the team is fully committed to developing a smooth and seamless user-experience accessible to all types of users. It is also expected that as we draw closer to a mainnet release of the marketplace, a lot of efforts will be spent attracting users by clearly communicating all the advantages of a private-by-design and decentralized eCommerce environment. He also expects the team to keep growing in number, talent, and experience.</li><li>When asked about other dApps currently being developed on Particl, it was confirmed that nothing is in the works as it relates to the official Particl team. Paul speculated about possible alternative versions to the marketplace he would personally enjoy seeing being developed in the future such as wanted ads, penny auctions, bidding options, coin swaps, and etc.</li><li>Within the Particl community itself, this question had a lot of users envisioning their own wish list of private-by-design dApps built on Particl. There were a lot of good ideas being thrown around such as decentralized social media dApps, gambling/casino dApps, video streaming dApps (<a href=\"https://pastebin.com/raw/eMUSxLaA\">with one streaming dApp allegedly currently under development by an anonymous community member</a>), and etc. One thing is for sure; the idea of private-by-design dApps is a very exciting prospect that is poised to dramatically improve several industries.</li><li>Ryno was asked about the nature of the delays in regards to the release of the alpha version of the marketplace. Ryno mentioned these delays caused the team to rethink parts of its organizational process and act on improving it. He mentioned that as the team rapidly grew, the scoping did not go into enough details. There is now much more documentation being made by the team so that each Particl developer can more effectively work in sync with their peers. Agile methodologies are now also being put into practice, and <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-6-new-team-members-7cc38f92e5c5\">two new development managers (Carmen and Vivienne) have been hired</a>. It was mentioned that the team now uses the more effective Jira software for issue tracking as opposed to Github and that bi-weekly internal reports are now also being produced. This should be reflected soon in Particl’s <a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report\">status reports</a>.</li></ul><h2 id=\"bi-weekly-recap\">Bi-Weekly Recap</h2><p>There is a lot going on with Particl at the moment, and the last two weeks have been quite eventful for the project.</p><h3 id=\"particl-team-is-expanding\">Particl Team is Expanding</h3><p>On the 27th of June, <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-welcomes-6-new-team-members-7cc38f92e5c5\">we introduced 6 new team members</a> including three managers and three developers.

This change redirects the full 3.5% issuance to\nstakers, keeping their reward rate stable.\n\nNature of this Proposal\nCommunity Governance Explained — Particl Academy latest documentationGet\nfamiliar with the community governance of the Particl DAO.

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est. July, 2025\n * Implementation: Upon successful vote (75% approval rate with minimum quorum\n   of 20% of the total supply over 10,080 blocks) and subsequent hard fork.\n\nImpact\nIf approved, this change will:\n\n * Significantly reduce PART's inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%;\n * Reduce PART’s inflation rate by 0.5% every year until it reaches 1.0%;\n * Remove the network treasury;\n * Initiate a hard fork of the Particl blockchain.\n\nWe believe this proposal represents a positive step toward optimizing the\nParticl network's economic model while ensuring sustainable project development\nand incentivising our community to actively promote and grow the\nnetwork.Important: For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are\nrunning its latest version.

Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as <strong>“hard money” i.e. a currency with a fixed hard cap in supply.</strong></p><p>Whilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when all 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this assumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit e.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. </p><p><strong>Furthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance of new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at this present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently behaves as soft money</strong> (even though it is expected to become hard money in the future). </p><p>Almost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to incentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security budgets.</p><p>Thus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing supply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are inherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft money.</p><p><strong>If we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity.</strong> This is 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART a soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in intrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.</p><p><strong>We should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x worse than them.</strong></p><p><strong>Particl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively targeting transformation into hard money.</strong></p><p>At present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget generated by:</p><ul><li>Network transaction fees</li><li>New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).</li></ul><p>Staking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active circulation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new tokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens minted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases - rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by<br>new token issuance (supply inflation).</p><p>In many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism of asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes that we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token for yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked will either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network grows.</p><p>Staking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not actively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity. Staking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value of circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however paradoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are essentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity that brings intrinsic value<br>to the network.</p><p>So if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed towards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully transform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?</p><p>Simple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the frequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively reducing new token issuance.</p><p>Fortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key applications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:</p><h3 id=\"basicswapdex-bsx-\">BasicSwapDex (BSX)</h3><ul><li>Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​</li><li>​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third party<br>integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap) with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.</li></ul><h3 id=\"particl-marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</h3><ul><li>Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds utilised in purchasing goods and services.​</li><li>​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.</li></ul><p><strong>In any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development team and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl network otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time.</strong> They are effectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual supply inflation reward decreases.</p><p>I note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation rate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that result in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft currency.</p><p><strong>It is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus on increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability</strong> to create an L1 system whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to adequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful in that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with additional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money<br>than traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other cryptocurrencies currently traded today.</p><p>Regardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community is active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to further propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to 0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency funded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that satisfies my definition of “hard money”.</p><h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2><ul><li>Voting opens: Est.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>.
