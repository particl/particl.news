In fact, cold staking pools that were using\nmulti-signature addresses (i.e., coldstakingpool.com\n[https://coldstakingpool.com]) had been affected by a bug that prevented the\nautomated distribution of staking rewards after the release of Particl Core\n0.19.2.19. \n\nThis bug has been resolved yesterday, cold staking pools operators have been\nnotified of the fix, and rewards have already been successfully distributed to\nstakers that are staking on pools that have since then made the update. The\napplied fix has for bonus effect to make cold staking pools significantly\nfaster. You can check out the fix here\n[https://github.com/particl/coldstakepool/commit/09aecddc1f9078f20e2bb57342270a04fc63f6e9]\n.\n\nv0.21, compact leveldb, use rapidjson, abort on failure, show pending ·\nparticl/coldstakepool@09aecddPooled coldstaking demo.

This\nweek, we've got some exciting news to share we're sure you'll love in regards to\nParticl Desktop 3.2, so let's not waste time and get to it right away!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Update\nThis week, we've finally completed the integration of the new messaging system\ninto Particl Marketplace! This new feature lets sellers and buyers (or potential\nbuyers) communicate with each other in a free-flow form. \n\nYou can now send messages to the seller directly from a listing's public\nchatroomThis new update introduces user messaging in two different ways. On one end,\neach listing now has a \"public chatroom\" in which any user can ask questions to\nthe seller. All messages posted in a listing's chatroom are publicly viewable,\nmeaning anyone can see current and past messages sent this way. This function is\nlikely to replace the \"Reviews\" functionality, although we would love to get\nyour feedback and thoughts on the matter during Particl Desktop 3.2's testnet\nround.\n\nOn the other end, a private chatroom, only accessible and viewable to the seller\nand the buyer of an item, is opened up when placing an order. Communications\ninitiated this way are entirely end-to-end encrypted and anonymous, and it is\nimpossible for any third-party or middleman to intercept messages. Messages are\npropagated through the SMSG network and never go through any central server.\nPrivate in-order chatrooms are available from the Order section of the Purchases\nand Sell pages, depending on whether you are the seller or the buyer.\n\nAt this time, the messaging system is tied to the marketplace and isn't a\nstandalone feature yet. We plan on isolating that feature moving forward to make\nit possible to open private chatrooms with individuals without having to use\nParticl Marketplace.\n\nPrivate in-order conversation between a seller and a buyerWith the messaging\nsystem now ready for the marketplace, we are currently looking at a few minor\nissues raised within the last few days and, if there's any fix required, they'll\nbe included in Particl Desktop 3.2.\n\nBarring any issue stemming from the current round of internal testing, we'll be\nready to release Particl Desktop 3.2 on testnet within the next 24 to 72 hours.\nThen, if all goes well, we'll be able to release it, on mainnet, a few days\nafter that.\n\nAs always, we highly encourage you to come and help us test this new major\nParticl Desktop release to ensure that no edge case or environment-specific\nissue is missed by the team. Additionally, as we've mentioned just a bit above,\nwe're also curious about your feedback regarding the deprecation of the Reviews\nfunctionality in favor of public chatrooms within listing pages.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Core and BasicSwap Update\nNew Particl Core Version ✅\nRelease Particl Core 0.21.2.9 · particl/particl-coreRelease\nNotes:https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.21/doc/release-notes-particl.md#02129Hashes56c899c09cb11948c9b81e92ff2599fbcf8cd18b10fd3e708064d37b1b1c4bbd\nparticl-0.21.2.9-aarch64...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.9]Earlier this\nweek, we pre-released Particl Core 0.21.2.9\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.2.9], a release\nfocused on network stability, on Github. It includes a variety of SMSG network\nimprovements and also improves the stability of the blockchain's connectivity by\nbanning misbehaving peers more effectively. Follow this link\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.21/doc/release-notes-particl.md#02129] \nfor the full list of changes.\n\nWhile this is still marked as a pre-release, meaning your cold staking nodes\nwon't update automatically through Partyman, we encourage you to install this\nnew version and report back to the team should you encounter any issues. It will\nbe marked as a full release shortly.\n\nParticl Electrum ✅\nRelease 4.2.1.5 Particl · tecnovert/electrum\nHashesdb67abb00dc575a4270c88cbd36105ae72355f7edc1c21830865fd8f9769afcb\nElectrumParticl-4.2.1.5-arm64-v8a-release.apkf8df945d44de292395cdc20452931fa12d2fd2a1fa9352a794e76be74ab8da15\nElectrumPart...GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/electrum/releases/tag/4.2.1.5_particl]We've also\npushed a minor cosmetic fix\n[https://github.com/particl/electrum/commit/f1b8c13636c9ffcf6fd37a03340d4eff2d7f0354] \nto Particl Electrum mobile which changes the display of staking transactions\nfrom a negative fee to a correctly marked staking reward.\n\nTo that effect, we pushed, a few hours ago, new mobile builds (.apk) for Android\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/electrum/releases/tag/4.2.1.5_particl] that fix\nthis issue.\n\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · particl/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree. Contribute\nto particl/particl-core development by creating an account on GitHub.GitHub\nparticl [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master]As usual,\nvarious code adaptions and merges have been done as part of our ever-ongoing\nprocess of keeping Particl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. You\ncan always keep track of those changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nAs a reminder, while this task may appear \"mundane\" on the surface, it is vital\nfor the deployment of certain functionalities that are critical to the success\nof our ecosystem. \n\nFor example, Taproot, which is now available on Particl, is poised to become an\nimportant feature of the upcoming BasicSwap DEX. By not keeping the Particl Core\ncodebase up-to-date with the ongoing Bitcoin developments, integrating such a\nmajor feature would not only be very messy and time-consuming, but it would also\npotentially be unsafe as it would be missing important dependencies.\n\nWhat keeping up with the Bitcoin codebase allows Particl to do is to leverage\nall the new exciting updates, features, and functionalities of Bitcoin and\nintegrate them, when and if needed, into our wider ecosystem in a timely and\nsafe manner.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nWe do not have anything in particular to mention this week on BasicSwap other\nthan what was mentioned in last week's report. We are still working on\nfinalizing the DEX's user interface and it is the current main focus of our\ndesigner and lead UI/UX, Gerlof van Ek.\n\nExclusive Episode of the Super Dangerous Club\nYou're probably already aware of the Super Dangerous Club, the weekly show by\nParticl advocates Dr. Kap and e-commerce expert Joe Fisher. They talk about\nvarious topics touching on technology, geo-politics, futurism, and more. \n\nLast week, they focused their episode on the Particl project and Particl\nMarketplace. If you're a fan of Particl, then this one is an episode you must\nnot skip.\n\nWhile the episode itself is not yet released anywhere other than on Clubhouse,\nwe thought of sharing it here in advance for our weekly progress update readers\nonly.\n\nEvery week, the show is broadcasted on all your favorite platforms. But to\nreally get into the action, we invite you to come and speak your mind directly\nwith our two wonderful hosts on Clubhouse's live episodes.\n\nTo see where the SDC is available, follow the linktree below!\n\n@superdangerous | Linktree?Meet Kap and Joe talk about anything outside ? of\npolitics, society, tech ?Linktree [https://linktr.ee/superdangerous]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

This function is likely to replace the \"Reviews\" functionality, although we would love to get your feedback and thoughts on the matter during Particl Desktop 3.2's testnet round.</p><p>On the other end, a private chatroom, only accessible and viewable to the seller and the buyer of an item, is opened up when placing an order. Communications initiated this way are entirely <strong>end-to-end encrypted</strong> and <strong>anonymous</strong>, and it is impossible for any third-party or middleman to intercept messages. Messages are propagated through the SMSG network and <strong>never go through any central server</strong>. Private in-order chatrooms are available from the Order section of the Purchases and Sell pages, depending on whether you are the seller or the buyer.</p><p>At this time, the messaging system is tied to the marketplace and isn't a standalone feature yet. We plan on isolating that feature moving forward to make it possible to open private chatrooms with individuals without having to use Particl Marketplace.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2022/04/29April202213-59-37.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2022/04/29April202213-59-37.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2022/04/29April202213-59-37.png 1000w, /glink/2022/04/29April202213-59-37.png 1209w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption>Private in-order conversation between a seller and a buyer</figcaption></figure><p>With the messaging system now ready for the marketplace, we are currently looking at a few minor issues raised within the last few days and, if there's any fix required, they'll be included in Particl Desktop 3.2.</p><p>Barring any issue stemming from the current round of internal testing, <strong>we'll be ready to release Particl Desktop 3.2 on testnet within the next 24 to 72 hours</strong>.

And\nboy has this week been a busy one with the release of several updates both to\nParticl Core and Particl Desktop.\n\nSo let's not waste any time and jump right into the crux of this update!‌\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop Progress Report\nThis week has been championed by the release of two very important updates to\nParticl Desktop [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-1-3-released/]. Indeed,\nan odd issue surfaced in which marketplace listings were not being received and\ndecrypted by other peers of the network. While this did not affect the sellers'\nability to publish listings, it caused products not to show up for other users\ncreating the illusion of an empty marketplace.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.1.3 ReleasedParticl Desktop 3.1.3 is now available and fixes\na\nmajor issue that prevented listings from being received, decrypted and\ndisplayed\nproperly on Particl Marketplace.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-1-3-released/]After relentless\ntroubleshooting and debugging with some of our current vendors, the root cause\nof the issue was identified and Particl's desktop developer Arnold Bansemer\npushed out a fix that resolves this issue.\n\nAlthough the Particl Desktop 3.1.2\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-1-2-released/] fixed a significant\nportion of this issue, the patch was later completed with the release of the \n3.1.3 [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-3-1-3-released/] versions which\nfully fixes the problem for good. Because this bug causes significant issues to\nthe marketplace's user experience (you can't see listings), this update is\nnecessary for anyone that wants to use Particl Marketplace.\n\nAnd so, although we hoped to be done this week with the in-market messaging\nsystem, the major issue mentioned just above created delays in its completion.\nWe can, however, report that it is almost complete by now. Once fully ready and\ninternally tested, we'll be ready to issue testnet builds for the Particl\ncommunity to test out the new major feature thoroughly.\n\nParticl Core Progress Update\nAs for Particl Core, this was a very busy and productive week as well. We've\nalso seen two releases for the two most popular Particl codebases; Particl Core\n0.19 and 0.21. ‌\n\nNew Particl Core Releases AvailableTwo new Particl Core releases (0.19.2.20 and\n0.21.2.8) are now available for download!Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/new-particl-core-releases-available/]These two releases\nfixed an array of bugs, notably one that prevented some anon outputs from being\nproperly displayed within the Coin Control menu. It also introduced a few\nimprovements like Particl's 0.19 codebase now having the same default ring size\nas all other maintained codebases as well as Particl Desktop. This improves the\nlevel of privacy of people making anon transactions using the 0.19 codebase by\nunifying the default value across all environments.\n\nNote that, since these two releases were in pre-release mode, Particl's cold\nstaking application doesn't automatically update to them yet. This is normal. In\nfact, ever since the release of 0.21.2.8 earlier this week, the build has been\nupdated to deal with a specific issue regarding peer selection and banning\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/0.21/doc/release-notes-particl.md#02128]\n.

In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
