only because it’s\nParticl’s second anniversary. No, there is indeed some very exciting news that\nis now ready to be shared. Are you ready to unwrap that intel gift?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Open Marketplace Updates\nAll of the bugs that have been identified during the last testnet run (with\nblinded escrow) have been fixed. As it stands right now, we would feel 100%\nconfident to release, on mainnet, the Open Marketplace with blinded escrows. The\nproduct is stable, secure, and runs very smoothly.\n\nAll there is left to do, now, is to finish the integration of the RingCT\nprotocol into the escrow system of the marketplace so that all transactions can\nbe completely untraceable.\n\nNew Marketplace Testnet Build Releases Next Week\nAs you probably are well aware by now, the 16th of July hardfork has been\nsuccessfully completed, meaning both the RingCT and Bulletproofs protocols are\nnow available on mainnet.\n\nAnd because the OMP Library had initially been coded with RingCT in the first\nplace, the integration of this privacy protocol into the escrow system has been\npretty quick to go through. Of course, it was necessary for Quarkslab to\ncomplete its audit of MLSAG and Bulletproofs before integrating these two\nprotocols into a live version of the marketplace, but as the results were\npublished on the 5th of July (with the actual report being received by the\nParticl team a few days prior), it took just a few days for the Particl\ndevelopers to bake in the integration into the back-end.\n\nThe team is currently running tests and making a few tweaks that are required to\nensure the integration is as stable as the blinded escrow system was. We are\nestimating that these tweaks will only take a few days to complete, which would\nbring the next testnet build of the Open Marketplace, with full anon (RingCT)\nescrow, to somewhere within the next week. As always, this isn’t a hard\ndeadline, but this is what we are targeting and feeling confident about at this\nmoment.\n\nThis build will contain fixes for all the bugs and issues identified last week\nas well as the new RingCT-powered escrow system. This new testing round will\nallow you to see how the marketplace will look like once it hits mainnet, but it\nwill also allow you to earn a few PART!\n\nTwo Bug Bounties\nAt the same moment as the release of the new testnet build, two bug bounties\nwill officially start —one for the testnet marketplace build, and the other as a\npermanent, general bug bounty for mainnet.\n\nThe testnet bug bounty is pretty self-explanatory: earn PART for finding bugs\nthat remain in the latest version of the testnet build. This bug bounty, which \nwill run for two weeks, is put in place specifically to ensure that the first\nmainnet release of the Open Marketplace is as smooth as possible and that the\ncode is entirely secure. Note that, as bugs and issues are identified, it is\nlikely that there will be more than one build posted throughout the duration of\nthe bug bounty.\n\nThe second bounty, the permanent one, is a mainnet bounty that’s going to stay\nposted on Particl’s official website [http://particl.io]. This bounty is\ndedicated to incentivizing people to find bugs, vulnerabilities, or issues, and\nproperly disclose them to the Particl team in exchange for compensation for\ntheir work and contribution. More information about the bounty will be given\nwhen it is published on particl.io [http://particl.io], which is going to be on\nthe same day as the release of the next testnet marketplace build.\n\nGenerating Market Keys (Advanced Users can Start TODAY)\nAs the back-end code of the marketplace is now ready for launch, with RingCT\nescrow now baked in, it is now possible for anyone to start generating their\nvery own market keys using the repository (and its README.md file) linked just\nbelow.\n\nparticl/particl-market [https://github.com/particl/particl-market]\nParticl Marketplace. Contribute to particl/particl-market development by\ncreating an account on GitHub. [https://github.com/particl/particl-market]\ngithub.com [https://github.com/particl/particl-market]\n\n> Note: The Particl team has been building testnet and mainnet builds for\nconferences and community/internal testing using this repository, but they\nhaven’t been fully anon until after the hardfork.\nA market key, or Market ID, is a unique stream of characters and numbers which\ngives you access to a marketplace. These are, in reality, “private markets” that\nanyone can create. These markets can only be accessed by those who possess the\nkey, after which they gain full permissions over it (purchase products, list\nitems, flag undesirable content, etc).\n\nBootstrapping the Public Interface of the Open Marketplace\nGenerating a market key is important as the Particl team itself isn’t going to\nlaunch the marketplace. In fact, the Particl team is giving the opportunity for\nanyone in the community to create their own market key, push it on Github, and\nhave it be selected as the default key for the public interface of the\nmarketplace. In other words, the default key for the marketplace is going to be\n100% community-powered.\n\nYou see, on Particl, there is no difference between a private and a public\nmarket. The public interface of the Open Marketplace is merely a private market\nwhich has its key set as the default key on the Particl Desktop client. Any\nprivate market could be set as the default market, and this is the opportunity\nthat you will have as a community member.\n\nDon’t worry, there is no risk associated with integrating a community’s market\nkey as the default market. This is nothing like a trusted setup, and the market\nkey’s creator won’t have any sort of special access or permission over the\nmarketplace once the generated key gets merged. It’s not a master key.\n\nFor the next few days, it will be up to the more advanced users to figure out\nhow to generate market keys for themselves (following the instructions of the\nREADME.md file and the folder structure should give you enough hints on how to\ndo it). Then, in a few days, we’ll be giving out more details on how to do it so\nthat more people can join the fun.\n\nParticl Desktop 2.0 Releases on August 12, 2019\nOn the 12th of August, if everything goes well and no critical or significant\nbug is found on next week’s fully anon marketplace testnet build, Particl\nDesktop 2.0 will be released on mainnet.\n\nParticl Desktop 2.0, as it’s version number implies, is a pretty big milestone\nfor the project. Not only will it contain many new features (i.e. multi-wallets,\ncommunity proposals, etc) and UI/UX improvements that have been on testnet ever\nsince, but it will also be fully compatible with the Particl Open Marketplace,\non mainnet.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is it! This is the final burst to the finish line.\n\nWhat is tremendously exciting is that this isn’t actually the end by any means,\nbut rather the beginning of a new phase for Particl.\n\nWith the Particl Open Marketplace on mainnet fostering private, decentralized,\nand permissionless eCommerce, we are excited to see how vendors and buyers alike\nwill use the available features.\n\nSo get ready! The months of July and August will be ones to remember for a very\nlong time!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Particl-s-Second-Anniversary/1-3aInZ5BQOBAdR3s0ESIbig.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"let-s-celebrate-\">Let’s celebrate! ??</h3><p>Today is Particl’s second anniversary, and there are plenty of good reasons to take a moment and celebrate.</p><p>This blog post is definitely a celebratory one.

More information about the bounty will be given when it is published on <a href=\"http://particl.io\">particl.io</a>, which is going to be on the same day as the release of the next testnet marketplace build.</p><h3 id=\"generating-market-keys-advanced-users-can-start-today-\">Generating Market Keys (Advanced Users can Start TODAY)</h3><p>As the back-end code of the marketplace is now ready for launch, with RingCT escrow now baked in, it is now possible for anyone to start generating their very own market keys using the repository (and its README.md file) linked just below.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-market\"><strong>particl/particl-market</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-market\"><em>Particl Marketplace.

These are, in reality, “private markets” that anyone can create. These markets can only be accessed by those who possess the key, after which they gain full permissions over it (purchase products, list items, flag undesirable content, etc).</p><h3 id=\"bootstrapping-the-public-interface-of-the-open-marketplace\">Bootstrapping the Public Interface of the Open Marketplace</h3><p>Generating a market key is important as the Particl team itself isn’t going to launch the marketplace. In fact, the Particl team is giving the opportunity for anyone in the community to create their own market key, push it on Github, and have it be selected as the default key for the public interface of the marketplace. In other words, the default key for the marketplace is going to be 100% community-powered.</p><p>You see, on Particl, there is no difference between a private and a public market. The public interface of the Open Marketplace is merely a private market which has its key set as the default key on the Particl Desktop client. Any private market could be set as the default market, and this is the opportunity that you will have as a community member.</p><p>Don’t worry, there is no risk associated with integrating a community’s market key as the default market. This is nothing like a trusted setup, and the market key’s creator won’t have any sort of special access or permission over the marketplace once the generated key gets merged. It’s not a master key.</p><p>For the next few days, it will be up to the more advanced users to figure out how to generate market keys for themselves (following the instructions of the README.md file and the folder structure should give you enough hints on how to do it). Then, in a few days, we’ll be giving out more details on how to do it so that more people can join the fun.</p><h2 id=\"particl-desktop-2-0-releases-on-august-12-2019\">Particl Desktop 2.0 Releases on August 12, 2019</h2><p>On the 12th of August, if everything goes well and no critical or significant bug is found on next week’s fully anon marketplace testnet build, Particl Desktop 2.0 will be released on mainnet.</p><p>Particl Desktop 2.0, as it’s version number implies, is a pretty big milestone for the project. Not only will it contain many new features (i.e. multi-wallets, community proposals, etc) and UI/UX improvements that have been on testnet ever since, but it will also be fully compatible with the Particl Open Marketplace, on mainnet.</p><hr><p>This is it! This is the final burst to the finish line.</p><p>What is tremendously exciting is that this isn’t actually the end by any means, but rather the beginning of a new phase for Particl.</p><p>With the Particl Open Marketplace on mainnet fostering private, decentralized, and permissionless eCommerce, we are excited to see how vendors and buyers alike will use the available features.</p><p><strong>So get ready!

As it stands right now, <strong>we would feel 100% confident to release, on mainnet, the Open Marketplace with blinded escrows</strong>. The product is stable, secure, and runs very smoothly.</p><p>All there is left to do, now, is to finish the integration of the RingCT protocol into the escrow system of the marketplace so that all transactions can be completely untraceable.</p><h3 id=\"new-marketplace-testnet-build-releases-next-week\">New Marketplace Testnet Build Releases Next Week</h3><p>As you probably are well aware by now, the 16th of July hardfork has been successfully completed, meaning both the RingCT and Bulletproofs protocols are now available on mainnet.</p><p>And because the OMP Library had initially been coded with RingCT in the first place, the integration of this privacy protocol into the escrow system has been pretty quick to go through. Of course, it was necessary for Quarkslab to complete its audit of MLSAG and Bulletproofs before integrating these two protocols into a live version of the marketplace, but as the results were published on the 5th of July (with the actual report being received by the Particl team a few days prior), it took just a few days for the Particl developers to bake in the integration into the back-end.</p><p>The team is currently running tests and making a few tweaks that are required to ensure the integration is as stable as the blinded escrow system was. We are estimating that these tweaks will only take a few days to complete, which would bring the next testnet build of the Open Marketplace, with full anon (RingCT) escrow, to somewhere within the next week. As always, this isn’t a hard deadline, but this is what we are targeting and feeling confident about at this moment.</p><p>This build will contain fixes for all the bugs and issues identified last week as well as the new RingCT-powered escrow system. This new testing round will allow you to see how the marketplace will look like once it hits mainnet, but it will also allow you to earn a few PART!</p><h3 id=\"two-bug-bounties\">Two Bug Bounties</h3><p>At the same moment as the release of the new testnet build, two bug bounties will officially start — <strong>one for the testnet marketplace build, and the other as a permanent, general bug bounty for mainnet</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>testnet bug bounty</strong> is pretty self-explanatory: earn PART for finding bugs that remain in the latest version of the testnet build. This bug bounty, which <strong>will run for two weeks</strong>, is put in place specifically to ensure that the first mainnet release of the Open Marketplace is as smooth as possible and that the code is entirely secure. Note that, as bugs and issues are identified, it is likely that there will be more than one build posted throughout the duration of the bug bounty.</p><p>The second bounty, the permanent one, is a <strong>mainnet bounty</strong> that’s going to stay posted on <a href=\"http://particl.io\">Particl’s official website</a>. This bounty is dedicated to incentivizing people to find bugs, vulnerabilities, or issues, and properly disclose them to the Particl team in exchange for compensation for their work and contribution.

It was also announced that anyone\ncould start generating market keys and any of them could be submitted on Github\nto enable market capabilities on the official Particl Desktop 2.0 build.\n\nSo let’s have some fun with it!\nTo celebrate this important milestone, as well as the upcoming Trezor hardware\ndevice support for PART [https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/pull/316],\nthe Particl team will be giving away one (1) Trezor hardware device to 3 random\npeople who submit a set of market keys of their own. On top of this, the team\nwill also be giving away one (1) free limited edition t-shirt to every\nparticipant of this contest.\n\nLet’s first understand what this contest and giveaway are all about: the\ncreation and selection of market keys to be used as the default market on\nParticl’s Open Marketplace.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Content (Click Me)\n * What are Market Keys?\n * Create a Set of Market Keys\n * Submit Your Keys by Creating a Pull Request on Github\n * Contest Prizes\n * Contest Rules\n * How to Vote\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat are Market Keys?\nTo understand market keys, we need to refer back to the difference between user\nmarkets and the main interface of the Open Marketplace.\n\nMarket Keys are similar to PART address keys. There is a private and public key\nthat identifies a PART address — market keys work in the same way. Markets\nwithin Particl Desktop have a public and private key. Users can view, buy and\nsell items on all markets they know the keys of. The default market on Particl\nOpen Marketplace will have its public and private keys in the code and viewable\nby all clients. Users can also create other markets the same way. In these\nmarkets, only the clients or users invited to that market can view, buy and sell\nitems on it. Just like PART addresses, the existence of these markets is unknown\nto everyone without the private key.\n\nWhen installing Particl Desktop and enabling the marketplace, you can browse the\nlistings by clicking on the LISTINGS tab. This takes you to the main interface\nof the Open Marketplace where anyone can publish, purchase, and moderate\nlistings with no restriction. Additional markets, usually referred to as “user\nmarkets”, “VIP markets”, or “private markets”, can also be created by anyone.\n\nThese markets can only be accessed by manually inputting their market keys into\nyour local Desktop client. They behave exactly like the main interface of the\nOpen Marketplace: anyone with access to a specific market can publish, purchase,\nor moderate any listing it contains.\n\nThere isn’t any difference between these user-created markets and the default\ninterface of the Open Marketplace. Both are fully independent markets that can\nbe used, to their full extent, by anyone that’s connected to them. The only\nperceived difference is because the default interface of the Open Marketplace is\na market that is enabled and displayed by default, without requiring you to\nmanually connect your Particl Desktop client to its market keys, whereas user\nmarkets need to be manually connected to.\n\n> The main interface of the marketplace is exactly the same thing as a user\nmarket. The only difference is that everybody shares and knows the keys of the\nmain interface. —Arnold Bansemer, Particl Developer\n[https://github.com/zaSmilingIdiot/]\nAs you probably realize by now, even the main interface of the Open Marketplace\nrequires market keys so that Particl Desktop can connect to it by default. And\nwhile no extra step is required by the user to connect to the main interface of\nthe marketplace, this “connection” still need to be made before a new version of\nthe Open Marketplace is pushed publicly.\n\n> Note: It is not required to generate a key to use the Particl Open Marketplace.\nWhen downloading and installing Particl Desktop 2.0 or higher, it will come\npre-packaged with a market key already linked to the client.\nAnd to do just that, an entity has to generate and choose what market keys will\nbe used to host the main market of the Open Marketplace. This is where the\ncommunity comes in…\n\nHow to Generate and Submit Market Keys\nWhile the Particl team is building the Open Marketplace protocol, it doesn’t own\nor has any sort of control over the network itself. It is entirely up to the\ncommunity of users to run and govern it. That also means generating and choosing\nwhat set of market keys is going to be used to display the main interface of the\nmarketplace will be a 100% community-led process.\n\n> Note: Generating a set of market keys does not give you any special access,\npermission, or power over the market. Everyone that installs the Open\nMarketplace has equal rights and oversight over the generated market.

There is a private and public key that identifies a PART address — market keys work in the same way. Markets within Particl Desktop have a public and private key. Users can view, buy and sell items on all markets they know the keys of. The default market on Particl Open Marketplace will have its public and private keys in the code and viewable by all clients. Users can also create other markets the same way. In these markets, only the clients or users invited to that market can view, buy and sell items on it. Just like PART addresses, the existence of these markets is unknown to everyone without the private key.</p><p>When installing Particl Desktop and enabling the marketplace, you can browse the listings by clicking on the LISTINGS tab. This takes you to the main interface of the Open Marketplace where anyone can publish, purchase, and moderate listings with no restriction. Additional markets, usually referred to as “user markets”, “VIP markets”, or “private markets”, can also be created by anyone.</p><p>These markets can only be accessed by manually inputting their market keys into your local Desktop client. They behave exactly like the main interface of the Open Marketplace: anyone with access to a specific market can publish, purchase, or moderate any listing it contains.</p><p>There isn’t any difference between these user-created markets and the default interface of the Open Marketplace. Both are fully independent markets that can be used, to their full extent, by anyone that’s connected to them. The only perceived difference is because the default interface of the Open Marketplace is a market that is enabled and displayed by default, without requiring you to manually connect your Particl Desktop client to its market keys, whereas user markets need to be manually connected to.</p><blockquote>The main interface of the marketplace is exactly the same thing as a user market. The only difference is that everybody shares and knows the keys of the main interface. — <a href=\"https://github.com/zaSmilingIdiot/\">Arnold Bansemer, Particl Developer</a></blockquote><p>As you probably realize by now, even the main interface of the Open Marketplace requires market keys so that Particl Desktop can connect to it by default.

You’ll also notice you won’t be able to send or\nreceive transactions to people that have updated their nodes anymore.\n\nThat’s normal, it just means you are connected to the outdated version of the\nParticl network. All you need to do is update your wallet or node by getting the\nmost recent version of the client you are using (Particl Desktop, Particl Core,\nor Partyman).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n * To update a wallet, download the right client here: \n   https://particl.io/downloads\n * To update a staking node, enter the ./partyman update command as seen in this\n   video tutorial here: \n   https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1147618772112613376\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s RingCT & Bulletproofs\nParticl Explained - Private Transactions - Particl News\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd]\nAnonymous transactions, or Anon transactions, as referred to in Particl\nDesktop,\ntake privacy to the next level by not…\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd]\n\nRingCT is the privacy protocol made famous by Monero and is the second privacy\nprotocol, after Confidential Transactions (CT), to makes its way onto Particl’s\nmainnet. It fully anonymizes the transacting amounts and participants of any\ntransaction made using the protocol and makes financial data mining ineffective.\nThat’s because RingCT offers very strong privacy and plausible deniability that\nis supported by cryptography. Bulletproofs is an improvement to the technology\nwhich makes transactions less costly to send and lighter in size.\n\nUnlike Monero and all other RingCT-based cryptocurrencies, Particl has developed\na very different implementation that is compatible with the Bitcoin codebase, as\nopposed to the more rigid Cryptonote codebase, as is the case with Monero.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Bitcoin codebase is a much more flexible and\nprogrammable codebase. It enables RingCT to reach its full potential by not only\nbeing a protocol that makes currency transactions untraceable, but also brings\nanonymity to decentralized applications, atomic swaps, or even the Lightning\nNetwork itself, which is now running on Particl’s testnet\n[https://particl.news/particl-lightning-network-now-available-on-testnet-eb87a5ab65cd]\n.\n\n> Note: Particl’s custom RingCT and Bulletproofs implementations have been\naudited\nby Quarkslab security firm\n[https://particl.news/particl-mlsag-bulletproofs-security-audit-results-3581da33455e] \nand has been found to contain no bug or vulnerability and to behave precisely as\nexpected. The code has also had an additional code review by WSA\n[https://wesecureapp.com/] as well as an academic review made by Assistant\nProfessor Qiang Tang of the [https://web.njit.edu/~qiang/]NJIT Department of\nTechnology [https://web.njit.edu/~qiang/].\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to Use RingCT\nRingCT transactions are now enabled on Particl’s network and can be easily\nexecuted from these Particl clients:\n\nParticl Desktop\nParticl-Qt\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRingCT Best Practices & How to Help the Network\nHow can you help the network and contribute to its privacy strength? In short, \nhold funds in Anon balances and make RingCT transactions every once in a while.\n\nRingCT is a privacy protocol that becomes increasingly effective as more and\nmore people use it. This is one of the main reasons why the Particl Open\nMarketplace will make all transaction private by default using the protocol\n(more marketplace users automatically means a stronger privacy).\n\nTo help the network and support its privacy, it is recommended to leave a\nportion of your coins in Anon balances. This helps the network by providing more\noutputs that can be used by other users within their ring groups. In other\nwords, the more coins being held in Anon balances, the more outputs can be used\nby everyone else as decoys for their transactions.\n\nRingCT also gets even stronger when you make a few transactions here and there.\nThat’s because the protocol tends to prioritize recent outputs in order to \nmitigate the traceability of coins [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/].\n\nAdditionally, if you want to anonymize the coins you currently hold properly, it\nis recommended that you do multiple RingCT transactions (Anon balances to Anon \nbalances) to yourself before transferring coins held in your Anon balance back\nto your Public balance. That’s because an observer can tell the maximum size of\na recently created anon output by looking at the amounts of the non-blinded\ninputs that went into it. Alternatively, you can also wait some time after your \nPublic to Anon balance transfer so that your RingCT outputs can be used by\nvarious ring groups.

anonymity in\ncryptocurrencies and decentralized systems, we share our thoughts on the purpose\nof privacy in decentralized eCommerce platforms, specifically with regards to\nprotecting user safety and data sovereignty.\n\nA Brief Reminder of Bitcoin’s History\nNearly two decades ago, Bitcoin was introduced as a digital currency aiming to\nprovide financial freedom and personal sovereignty globally, irrespective of\none's background or circumstances.\n\nAnd while it spawned an incredible revolution, both in technological progress\nand online discourse, the proposed solution unfortunately fell short of\naccomplishing its stated mission.\n\nAn Unfortunate Reality\nContrary to early assumptions, Bitcoin transactions are far from private. In\nfact, they often fare worse than traditional fiat currencies in preserving\nfinancial confidentiality. Indeed, fiat systems typically handle fund transfers\nthrough secured channels designed to safeguard users' financial data from\nunauthorized public exposure.\n\nIn stark contrast, all Bitcoin transactions are permanently recorded on a public\nledger, openly exposing the entirety of one's financial details to any curious\nobserver. While Bitcoin's pseudonymous nature may foster a sense of anonymity in\nlimited contexts, this perception is increasingly recognized as a dangerous\nillusion.\n\nIn fact, transaction tracing capabilities have advanced significantly in the\npast few years, driven in part by regulatory requirements like\nKnow-Your-Customer (KYC) compliance that have necessitated increased transaction\nmonitoring by financial services.\n\nHistorically, only regulatory bodies and financial institutions had access to\ndetailed reports of users' on-chain financial histories through partnerships\nwith blockchain analytics firms however, the ability to effectively deanonymize\ntransactions and map them to real-world identities is rapidly proliferating to\nnew actors — most concerningly, criminals, hackers, and other malicious entities\nintent on exploiting this data for financial gain at the expense of unsuspecting\nvictims — thanks to the rapid evolution of large language models and artificial\nintelligence that have spawned widely accessible tracing protocols.\n\nThese escalating privacy vulnerabilities underscore the paramount importance of\ndeveloping robust privacy-preserving solutions for cryptocurrencies across the\nglobe, such as, among others, ”privacy coins”. Maintaining financial\nconfidentiality is not merely a luxury but an essential capability to safeguard\nusers operating in these systems.\n\nBitcoin and eCommerce\nHowever, when it comes to decentralized commerce – the logical evolution beyond\ndecentralized currencies – merely utilizing privacy coins is not sufficient.\nWhile on-chain transactions may be inherently private, the platforms\nfacilitating purchases and sales represent another significant attack vector\nthat must be addressed.\n\nAs regulatory obligations evolve, businesses operating centralized\ncryptocurrency platforms may be compelled to collect extensive user information,\nincluding transaction histories, associated identities, IP addresses, shipping\ndetails from buyers, sales data from sellers, and more. While one could\nreasonably expect regulatory bodies to handle such information responsibly, the\nsame assurances cannot be extended to the platforms themselves, as highlighted\nin our previous articles on the imperatives of privacy here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-protect-your-business-5b66beeea09a/] \nand here\n[https://particl.news/privacy-in-ecommerce-the-need-to-own-your-data-19bc31b0ec74/]\n.\n\nBut even if all platforms always acted in good faith, this centralized\naggregation of sensitive data becomes an enticing target for hackers and other\nmalicious actors seeking to exploit personal and financial information for\nillicit gains.\n\nThe Inherent Safety Risks of DeCommerce\nThe logical solution, therefore, is to develop an eCommerce platform that is as\ndecentralized as cryptocurrencies themselves. Such a platform would operate in a\npurely peer-to-peer manner, built upon a truly decentralized architecture devoid\nof single points of failure or centralized components. The objective is to offer\nservices akin to centralized eCommerce giants like eBay or Amazon, but without\nany central entity, thus eliminating the associated costs, fees, and frictions\ninherent to intermediaries. A \"decentralized online marketplace\", embodying\nBitcoin's ethos, and providing a clear user experience improvement over\ncentralized counterparts without data collection.\n\nHowever, while recent advancements in blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies\nenable such decentralized eCommerce platforms, they also introduce new\nchallenges in preserving users' financial data privacy and safety.\n\nPicture this scenario: You open a decentralized marketplace, hoping to purchase\na new computer online. You browse available listings from sellers worldwide and\nfind a suitable item. You proceed to add it to your cart and checkout, providing\nthe seller with your shipping address. Herein lies a significant safety concern;\nif you've paid using pseudonymous cryptocurrencies, you've likely revealed your\nphysical location alongside your entire financial history, including balances\nand past transactions.\n\nIn most cases, such disclosures may be innocuous, however, over an extended\nperiod, you or someone else may inadvertently expose critical details to\nmalicious actors, which could be used to identify and target the potential\nvictim. This risk vector is particularly concerning for high net-worth\nindividuals, as every purchase they make could effectively paint a target on\ntheir backs, making this situation simply unsustainable.\n\nCentralized platforms like eBay or Amazon typically circumvent this issue, as\npayments are facilitated through highly regulated centralized providers like\nPayPal, among others. While these entities face valid criticisms, they at least\navoid exposing users' complete financial histories on pseudonymous ledgers.\n\nHowever, a decentralized platform, by its very nature, does not rely on payment\nprocessors. Instead, it enables direct peer-to-peer trade between buyers and\nsellers. Consequently, an alternative solution must be implemented to preserve\nusers' financial privacy and security.\n\nThe Need for Privacy in DeCommerce\nParticl Marketplace addresses these concerns with its decentralized and secure\nonline marketplace, often touted as a privacy-first eCommerce solution. It\nensures user safety by providing robust privacy safeguards in two critical\nareas.\n\nTransactional Privacy\nFirst, it facilitates complete transactional privacy for counterparties through\nthe use of PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, which integrates advanced\non-chain privacy protocols. Two specific protocols are instrumental in\npreserving financial confidentiality: Confidential Transactions (\"CT\") and ring\nsignatures (\"RingCT\").\n\nCT transactions conceal the transfer amounts between parties, while RingCT\nobfuscates both transaction amounts and participant identities. However, RingCT\ntransactions lack programmable outputs, rendering them incompatible with\ndecentralized applications like Particl Marketplace. To address this limitation,\nRingCT inputs can be mapped to CT outputs, which possess programmable\ncapabilities. By chaining these protocols, Particl Marketplace effectively\nharnesses RingCT's enhanced privacy while facilitating seamless integration,\nproviding users with safety — which is otherwise entirely absent without\ntransactional privacy — and the assurance that their financial data remains\nconfidential during transactions.\n\nData-free Marketplace Activity\nSecondly, Particl Marketplace addresses the concerns surrounding excessive data\ncollection practices by centralized eCommerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, and\nEtsy, which have faced criticism for undermining user privacy. Some platforms\nhave even exploited user data to directly compete with their own sellers, as\nexemplified by AmazonBasics products and other Amazon sub-brands – an issue we\nhave previously explored in depth here\n[https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/].\n\nMoreover, while platforms claim to harvest data to enhance user experiences,\ntracking shopping habits can inadvertently expose sensitive information without\nconsent. A notable example is the Target pregnancy prediction case, in which an\nunsuspecting father learned of his daughter's pregnancy due to ad targeting – a\nscenario we’ve also previously discussed here\n[https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/].\n\nTo safeguard against such privacy infringements and data misuse, Particl\nMarketplace is designed to eliminate data generation, collection, storage, or\ndistribution entirely – encompassing both financial and non-financial metadata.\nAll marketplace activity data is stored locally, and all data transmitted (such\nas buyer-seller communications or shipping details) is conveyed through\nend-to-end encrypted messages via SMSG, a peer-to-peer data and messaging\nplatform (\"mixnet\") operating alongside Particl Core nodes\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/].\n\nThis privacy-first architecture ensures user safety and guarantees complete data\nownership and control, while preventing malicious data extraction through hacks,\nexploits, or the simple act of buying or selling online.\n\nConclusion\nWhile various accessibility, usability, and user-experience improvements are\nstill needed, the end result is a decentralized online marketplace that\neliminates fees and associated frictions inherent to third-party intermediaries\nwithin the eCommerce domain.\n\nHowever, beyond these benefits, it primarily serves as a secure platform for\ncryptocurrency users to engage in direct peer-to-peer trade without compromising\ntheir safety by exposing financial information to potentially malicious\nstrangers.\n\nAs we have aimed to clarify with this blog post, privacy in the context of\ncryptocurrency usage transcends a luxury or edge case. In scenarios such as\neCommerce/deCommerce, it is an absolute necessity to ensure the safety and\nwell-being of users transacting with unknown counterparties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

Such a platform would operate in a purely peer-to-peer manner, built upon a truly decentralized architecture devoid of single points of failure or centralized components. The objective is to offer services akin to centralized eCommerce giants like eBay or Amazon, but without any central entity, thus eliminating the associated costs, fees, and frictions inherent to intermediaries. A \"decentralized online marketplace\", embodying Bitcoin's ethos, and providing a clear user experience improvement over centralized counterparts without data collection.</p><p>However, while recent advancements in blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies enable such decentralized eCommerce platforms, they also introduce new challenges in preserving users' financial data privacy and safety.</p><p>Picture this scenario: You open a decentralized marketplace, hoping to purchase a new computer online. You browse available listings from sellers worldwide and find a suitable item. You proceed to add it to your cart and checkout, providing the seller with your shipping address. Herein lies a significant safety concern; if you've paid using pseudonymous cryptocurrencies, you've likely revealed your physical location alongside your entire financial history, including balances and past transactions.</p><p>In most cases, such disclosures may be innocuous, however, over an extended period, you or someone else may inadvertently expose critical details to malicious actors, which could be used to identify and target the potential victim. This risk vector is particularly concerning for high net-worth individuals, as every purchase they make could effectively paint a target on their backs, making this situation simply unsustainable.</p><p>Centralized platforms like eBay or Amazon typically circumvent this issue, as payments are facilitated through highly regulated centralized providers like PayPal, among others. While these entities face valid criticisms, they at least avoid exposing users' complete financial histories on pseudonymous ledgers.</p><p>However, a decentralized platform, by its very nature, does not rely on payment processors. Instead, it enables direct peer-to-peer trade between buyers and sellers. Consequently, an alternative solution must be implemented to preserve users' financial privacy and security.</p><h1 id=\"the-need-for-privacy-in-decommerce\">The Need for Privacy in DeCommerce</h1><p>Particl Marketplace addresses these concerns with its decentralized and secure online marketplace, often touted as a privacy-first eCommerce solution. It ensures user safety by providing robust privacy safeguards in two critical areas.</p><h2 id=\"transactional-privacy\">Transactional Privacy</h2><p>First, it facilitates complete transactional privacy for counterparties through the use of PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, which integrates advanced on-chain privacy protocols. Two specific protocols are instrumental in preserving financial confidentiality: Confidential Transactions (\"CT\") and ring signatures (\"RingCT\").</p><p>CT transactions conceal the transfer amounts between parties, while RingCT obfuscates both transaction amounts and participant identities. However, RingCT transactions lack programmable outputs, rendering them incompatible with decentralized applications like Particl Marketplace. To address this limitation, RingCT inputs can be mapped to CT outputs, which possess programmable capabilities. By chaining these protocols, Particl Marketplace effectively harnesses RingCT's enhanced privacy while facilitating seamless integration, providing users with safety — which is otherwise entirely absent without transactional privacy — and the assurance that their financial data remains confidential during transactions.</p><h2 id=\"data-free-marketplace-activity\">Data-free Marketplace Activity</h2><p>Secondly, Particl Marketplace addresses the concerns surrounding excessive data collection practices by centralized eCommerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, and Etsy, which have faced criticism for undermining user privacy. Some platforms have even exploited user data to directly compete with their own sellers, as exemplified by AmazonBasics products and other Amazon sub-brands – an issue we have previously explored in depth <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/\">here</a></strong>.</p><p>Moreover, while platforms claim to harvest data to enhance user experiences, tracking shopping habits can inadvertently expose sensitive information without consent. A notable example is the Target pregnancy prediction case, in which an unsuspecting father learned of his daughter's pregnancy due to ad targeting – a scenario we’ve also previously discussed <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/\">here</a></strong>.</p><p>To safeguard against such privacy infringements and data misuse, Particl Marketplace is designed to eliminate data generation, collection, storage, or distribution entirely – encompassing both financial and non-financial metadata. All marketplace activity data is stored locally, and all data transmitted (such as buyer-seller communications or shipping details) is conveyed through end-to-end encrypted messages via SMSG, <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\">a peer-to-peer data and messaging platform (\"mixnet\") operating alongside Particl Core nodes</a>.</p><p>This privacy-first architecture ensures user safety and guarantees complete data ownership and control, while preventing malicious data extraction through hacks, exploits, or the simple act of buying or selling online.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>While various accessibility, usability, and user-experience improvements are still needed, the end result is a decentralized online marketplace that eliminates fees and associated frictions inherent to third-party intermediaries within the eCommerce domain.</p><p>However, beyond these benefits, it primarily serves as a secure platform for cryptocurrency users to engage in direct peer-to-peer trade without compromising their safety by exposing financial information to potentially malicious strangers.</p><p>As we have aimed to clarify with this blog post, privacy in the context of cryptocurrency usage transcends a luxury or edge case. In scenarios such as eCommerce/deCommerce, it is an absolute necessity to ensure the safety and well-being of users transacting with unknown counterparties.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">The Open-Source Revolution</h3><p>We're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital economy that is fair and open to all.

for seamless and\npractical decentralized commerce solutions remains a driving force. Although\nthis is a self-evident use case for crypto, comprehensive solutions to use\ndecentralized money as money, without relying on heavily centralized\narchitecture, is lacking.\n\nWhile achieving this goal has proven challenging, this article explores how\nintegrating BasicSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) that offers Litecoin\npairs, into Particl Marketplace, a decentralized e-commerce platform, offers a\nsolution to overcome many user experience obstacles that have come to hinder the\nevolution of cryptocurrencies as a medium of payment.\n\nBy providing multi-currency support\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-integration-unlocking-currency-agnostic-commerce-on-particl/] \nto the decentralized e-commerce ecosystem, this upcoming integration offers a\ntangible path forward for many coins, unlocking the potential for widespread\ncryptocurrency usage in everyday retail transactions.\n\nWith this in mind, Litecoin, with its focused push as a payment currency, serves\nas the perfect candidate to illustrate this transformative potential, allowing\nanyone to use Litecoin for shopping.\n\nLitecoin; Faster and Cheaper Transactions\nLitecoin has garnered significant attention for its faster transaction times and\nlower fees compared to Bitcoin – a stark contrast to the latter's reputation for\nsluggish and costly processing. This, from the beginning, has positioned\nLitecoin as an ideal cryptocurrency for payments and commerce. Recognizing its\nstrengths in speed and affordability, the Litecoin community has been actively\npromoting its adoption as a practical and viable payment solution for years now.\n\nLitecoin MWEB and Privacy: Solidifying Litecoin as True Digital Cash\nLitecoin's MWEB (MimbleWimble Extension Blocks) introduces a significant\nimprovement to an already payment-friendly digital currency: transactional\nprivacy. This brings confidential transactions and privacy features to the\nLitecoin network, a pivotal development poised to solidify its positioning as\ntrue digital cash and a viable currency for payments.\n\nPrivacy is, of course, a crucial aspect in the realm of digital payments, as it\nsafeguards users' and businesses' financial information and promotes fungibility\n– a fundamental characteristic of sound money.\n\nParticl Marketplace: Redefining Decentralized E-Commerce\nWhile transactional privacy is paramount, it is also crucial for the platform\nfacilitating such payments to uphold privacy as well.\n\nEnvision this scenario: you send a private payment using Litecoin MWEB or even\nMonero to purchase an item online. However, you later discover that this\nplatform has been collecting user data and subsequently fell victim to a data\nbreach, exposing your shipping information, shopping history, along with\naddresses and payment details to an attacker. An absolute nightmare, even if the\ninitial payment was conducted through a private transaction.\n\nThis underscores the fact that private payments alone are insufficient to\ncompletely safeguard your shopping habits and selling history. This fact stands\nas a premise for the design of Particl Marketplace.\n\nParticl Marketplace is a decentralized, privacy-focused e-commerce platform\nbuilt using blockchain and peer-to-peer technology. Unlike traditional\ne-commerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, Etsy, or Alibaba, Particl Marketplace\noperates without intermediaries, ensuring secure and private transactions\nbetween users, free from fees or restrictions. Buyers and sellers transact\ndirectly, benefiting from a two-party escrow system that protects both parties\nand keeps all trade information private to the involved parties only.\n\nUsing Litecoin for Shopping on Particl Marketplace Soon to be AvailableWhile the\nplatform's unapologetically decentralized nature and privacy features make it an\nattractive alternative to centralized e-commerce platforms (which often face\ncensorship, data breaches, and other vulnerabilities), it is currently limited\nto using PART, Particl's native cryptocurrency, as the settlement currency. This\nis due to PART’s unique technology being an integral component in enabling some\nof the marketplace's unique features in the first place.\n\nBasicSwap DEX: Enabling Multi-Currency Payments\nLitecoin MWEB Balances and Conversions Live on BasicSwap DEXLitecoin\nMimbleWimble balances and balance conversions are now live on BasicSwap DEX, a\nfirst step towards full MWEB swaps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/litecoin-mweb-balances-and-conversions-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\nBasicSwap DEX is a decentralized exchange protocol and platform powered by\natomic swaps and SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a distributed data and\nmessaging protocol (often referred to as a “mixnet”). It offers a non-custodial\nand privacy-first trading experience, enabling trustless cross-chain swaps\nbetween different cryptocurrencies across various blockchains. And just like\nParticl Marketplace, it imposes no fees, restrictions, or data collection\npractices.\n\nAnd while it has always included Litecoin since its inception, it recently\nintegrated MWEB balances, paving the way for full MWEB swaps once Litecoin's\nupcoming core update — which will detect incoming Litecoin transactions using\nonly the viewkey without requiring the spendkey — goes live.\n\nTrade Litecoin on BasicSwap DEX (Litecoin DEX)By integrating BasicSwap into\nParticl Marketplace, alternative payment options are introduced at the time of\ncheckout, allowing users to seamlessly pay for items using their preferred\ncryptocurrency, a prime candidate of which being the fast and private Litecoin\nMWEB token.\n\nThis synergy aligns perfectly with Litecoin's vision of becoming a viable and\npractical form of digital cash, providing an additional real-world use case that\nfurther solidifies its position.\n\nBuilding Bridges Between Cryptocurrencies\nThe upcoming integration of BasicSwap and Litecoin MWEB on Particl Marketplace\nexemplifies BasicSwap's broader mission of forging bridges between diverse\ncryptocurrency communities and projects through its cross-chain functionality.\nThis synergy unites our efforts toward a shared vision of building a global\neconomy that prioritizes sovereignty and interoperability - the great promise of\ncrypto.\n\nBy enabling the use of Litecoin on Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap fosters a\nsymbiotic relationship that holds immense promise. Cultivating interoperability\nbetween the two ecosystems will accelerate the adoption of Litecoin as a\npractical, decentralized, and privacy-focused payment solution, while further\npositioning Particl as an enabler of financial activities beyond simple\npeer-to-peer transactions.\n\nIf you share this vision, we invite you to join the Particl and BasicSwap\ncommunity as we build towards a sovereign future and contribute to the mission,\nwhether through code or spreading awareness within the Litecoin community\nitself.

This is the future\nof BasicSwap, the atomic swap-based decentralized exchange that promises to be a\ncornerstone of the Particl ecosystem, and a catalyst for the growth of\ndecentralized commerce.\n\nThe Particl Ecosystem: A Beacon of Privacy Against Fiat\nParticl, through a multitude of modular privacy apps, can be understood as an\necosystem designed to respect individuals’ rights, freedoms, and privacy without\ncompromise. \n\nAt the core of the Particl project is the Particl Marketplace, a decentralized\ne-commerce platform that allows buyers and sellers to transact directly without\nintermediaries. This platform is complemented by a suite of privacy-focused\nprotocols that enable users to conduct various activities without relying on\nthird-party service providers.\n\nHowever, as Particl seeks to establish itself as a truly independent and\nself-sustaining ecosystem, a glaring issue has been a lack of avenues for\ninteracting effectively with the Marketplace, and the accessibility shortcomings\nthis represents. \n\nUntil recently, users have had to rely on centralized exchanges or unprotected\nover-the-counter (OTC) deals to acquire PART, the native currency of Particl\nMarketplace settlements, which undermines the platform's core principles of\nprivacy and autonomy.\n\nBridging the Gap: Bringing Decentralized Commerce to All Crypto\nWhile BasicSwap currently functions as an open-source decentralized exchange\napplication designed to facilitate trustless and anonymous trading of digital\nassets for all, its essence transcends that of a mere application; it is\nprimarily a protocol. This distinction, though seemingly minor on the surface,\ncarries profound implications for the future usage and purpose of BasicSwap.\n\nBy integrating it with the Particl Marketplace, thus providing to it\nBasicSwap-powered swap services such as a multi-currency payment option during\ncheckout, it promises to bridge the gap between privacy and decentralized\ncommerce, enabling users to interact with the Particl Marketplace using their\npreferred currency, while seamlessly converting the payment into PART in order\nto interact with certain aspects of the marketplace itself, such as Particl’s\nunique two-party escrow system\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-marketplace/marketplace_escrow.html]\n. The end result is a smooth experience where customers can pay for items in\ntheir preferred currency, which is then converted into PART in the background,\nproviding value to both the end-user and the Particl community of holders.\n\nBenefits that Extend Beyond the Usefulness of Multi-Currency Payments\nOne of the key advantages of BasicSwap is its ability to leverage atomic swap\ntechnology, specifically adaptor signatures, to allow users to exchange\ndifferent cryptocurrencies privately and without the need for a centralized\nintermediary. This not only enhances user security, it also opens up new\npossibilities for inter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects\nand their unique benefits.\n\nImagine a scenario where you wish to purchase an item on the Particl Marketplace\nusing Firo, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that employs the Lelantus protocol\nfor anonymity. With BasicSwap, you can initiate the transaction by sending your\nFiro to a designated address provided by the DEX. \n\nThe coins are then \"burned,\" and the Firo redeem token is exchanged for\nanonymous PART using BasicSwap, which is then used to complete the purchase on\nthe Particl Marketplace. Of course, all of this would happen behind the scenes,\nthe end-user being left with an easy-to-follow and comprehensive user experience\nakin to choosing a “checkout option” on traditional marketplaces.\n\nThis simple act demonstrates the power of atomic swap technology, effectively\ncombining the unique benefits of whatever coin is used as the checkout payment\noption (Firo, Monero, Litecoin MWEB, etc) and RingCT (the privacy protocol used\nby PART) in a single transaction. \n\nBy enabling such inter-compatibility between privacy technologies, BasicSwap\nunlocks a world of possibilities for users seeking to maintain their financial\nprivacy while engaging in decentralized commerce.\n\nThe Implications of a Truly Decentralized and Agnostic Payment System\nWhile the focus of BasicSwap is on bridging privacy projects and privacy coins,\nits true potential extends far beyond this scope. By offering a truly\ndecentralized and agnostic payment system, the BasicSwap protocol opens the door\nto a wide range of use cases and possibilities.\n\nOne exciting prospect is the integration of stablecoins, which could provide a\nmore stable and predictable means of value transfer within the Particl\necosystem. This could be particularly beneficial for e-commerce transactions,\nwhere price volatility can be a concern when cryptocurrency is involved.\n\nMoreover, the potential for anonymous stablecoins, or of anonymous swaps of\nexisting stablecoins, raises intriguing possibilities for enhancing financial\nprivacy while maintaining the benefits of price stability. As the technology\nevolves, BasicSwap's agnostic nature positions it to seamlessly integrate and\nfacilitate the use of such innovative financial instruments within the Particl\nMarketplace and beyond.\n\nConclusion: A Cornerstone for Decentralized Commerce\nThe integration of BasicSwap with the Particl Marketplace represents a\nsignificant milestone in our journey towards financial sovereignty. By providing\na robust and decentralized platform for trading PART and facilitating\ninter-compatibility between various privacy-focused projects, BasicSwap is\npoised to become a cornerstone of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nAs the world increasingly recognizes the importance of privacy and autonomy in\nfinancial transactions, platforms like Particl and BasicSwap are poised to lead\nthe way in fostering a truly decentralized and privacy-focused economic\nenvironment. \n\nWith its commitment to agnosticism and its ability to adapt to emerging\ntechnologies, BasicSwap has the potential to revolutionize the way we think\nabout decentralized commerce, paving the way for a future where individuals can\ntransact freely, securely, and without the need for trusted third parties.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
