The spectacular\nfailures of some centralized exchanges, like the Celsius debacle or last\nwinter’s implosion of the FTX exchange where billions of dollars of customer’s\nfunds were stolen obviously does nothing to help this climate.\n\nThere is, at the heart of the CEX vs DEX dynamic, a fundamental divide; while\nbig centralized entities suit traditional market logic, and can adapt these\nprinciples to fuel their own growth, they go against the fundamental principle\nof blockchain and cryptocurrency itself: private, peer-to-peer money.\n\nA Path Ahead\nIt could be argued that atomic swaps represent the most decentralized,\npotentially most private way to exchange cryptocurrencies. They are, of course,\nextremely resilient — as long as the blockchain accepts your transaction and you\nhave a reliable, hopefully private way to communicate with the other person, you\ncan swap. This, in effect, makes them exactly as decentralized as the\nblockchains involved. It also opens the door to entirely eliminating trust from\nthe process, unlike centralized models where you have to trust entities such as\nBinance, Celsius or FTX, and give them full control of your keys.\n\nIt was the Decred team who first made this technology a practical reality\n[https://github.com/decred/atomicswap], with their implementation of the first\nHTLC-based atomic swaps. At their core, HTLC swaps are easy to understand. They\ninvolve 'Hashed Timelock Contracts', which are types of smart contracts, on both\nthe buyer and seller sides. This means that both blockchains must have Timelock\nand Hashlock capabilities.\n\nBesides this limiting requirement, the HTLC swap also lacks privacy. While it\nallows for trustless, atomic swap exchanges to exist, it also creates a new\nproblem with it: when making a swap, a secret is created, hashed out, and\ninscribed, minutes apart, in the blockchains of both participating blockchains.\nThe problem here is that while this allows the protocol to verify the\ntransaction and move through the next steps of a swap, it also makes it trivial\nfor outside observers to infer the two participants of a swap, as well as what\namount of money is being exchanged. Here, an important privacy issue must be\naddressed.\n\nPoint Time Locked Contract Swaps and Adaptor Signatures\nAn important stepping stone to making atomic swaps the trustless, decentralized\nand hyper-private powerhouse that it can be lays in adaptor signatures.\n\nAs we explored in this piece [https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/],\nthe adaptor signature atomic swap scheme, otherwise referable to as \"Point Time\nLocked Contract (PTLC) swaps, begins with Andrew Poelstra’s work on scriptless\nscripts. Poelstra’s work was born out of necessity to interact with\nMimbleWimble, an extremely rigid blockchain protocol. These scriptless scripts\nexploit the linear nature of Schnorr signatures\n[https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/introduction-schnorr-signatures]: by\nusing Schnorr signatures in clever ways that are expanded further in this\narticle [https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/], or in greater\ntechnical detail here [https://hongchao.me/scriptless-script/].\n\nPoelstra’s work, in any case, makes it possible to replicate certain smart\ncontract capabilities without needing any of the actual smart contract language\na given coin may have. The adaptor signature swap, as such, is an example of a\nscriptless script.\n\nHowever, and this is important, Bitcoin and Monero do not use Schnorr signatures\nin its cryptographic signature algorithm — instead, they use a classic Elliptic\nCurve Digital Signature Algorithm, or ECDSA. There are a lot of differences\nbetween the two that we will not get into today, but suffice to say, adaptor\nsignature swaps on blockchain protocols using ECDSA curves, like Particl's PART,\nwould fall under the category of \"semi-scriptless protocols\n[https://medium.com/crypto-garage/adaptor-signature-on-ecdsa-cac148dfa3ad]\".\n\nThere is a huge benefit here compared to HTLC swaps, other than the fact that it\nenables PART's anon transaction type and other RingCT coins such as XMR to be\natomically swapped: they do not rely on identical hashes that need to be\ninscribed on the participating blockchains.\n\nOf course, in the case of RingCT based coins, that wouldn’t be much of a problem\neven if we were able to swap them using traditional HTLC swaps — which, again,\nis not possible on ECDSA schemes — because the hashes would be completely\nhidden.\n\nBut the beautiful thing here is that adaptor signature swaps can actually apply\nto a vast number of cryptocurrencies, and at the same time, make the swaps much,\nmuch more private.\n\nPre-Signed Transactions\nAn important aspect to the adaptor signature swap scheme is the use of\npre-signed refund transactions to solve the inherent problem of incomplete\nswaps, and achieve trustless, infallible atomic swaps while operating within the\nconfines of semi-scriptless protocols.\n\nPre-signing the refund transaction, addressing the XMR-BTC unhappy path problem.\nLet’s take a look at an atomic swap where Alice tries to swap 1 BTC with Bob for\n1 XMR. The first thing they do is pre-sign the refund transactions for Bitcoin.\nThis can be compared to signing the divorce papers before you get married. This\nallows them to split amicably even if one disappears and leaves the other\nstranded. Now at that very moment in time, the refund transaction is useless\nbecause they haven't deposited any money — much like you cannot file a divorce\nif you’ve never gotten married in the first place.\n\nThis is mandatory to making adaptor signature based swaps a functional reality\nin the real world, as any widespread implementations needs to account for\nincomplete swaps, interrupted flows, and other \"unhappy\" paths.\n\nAdditional Privacy and Scalability Improvements\nDuring the implementation of adaptor signature-based swaps into the BasicSwap\nDEX, we scrutinized the code to identify possible improvements that could be\nincorporated into the technology. The creation of this novel atomic swap type\nhas been a testament to open-source collaboration, and it's only fitting that we\ncontribute back to the community.\n\nAnd so, we ended up identifying a method to boost the privacy of PTLC swaps\nfurther and decrease the transaction size by adjusting a specific code segment.\n\nOriginal logic:\n\nOP_IF\n\tOP_SHA256 <hs> OP_EQUALVERIFY\n\t2 <Ba> <Bb> 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG\nOP_ELSE\n\t<t0> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP\n\t2 <Bra> <Brb> 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG\nOP_ENDIF\n\nSource:\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap/master/whitepaper/xmr-btc.pdf\nSimplified logic:\n\n2 <Ba> <Bb> 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG\n\nWith this change, adaptor signature-based swaps now look like any other 2-of-2\nmulti-signature transaction on the blockchain.

liquidity-providing\nscript for BasicSwap DEX. This user-friendly script enables you to offer\nliquidity for your preferred trading pairs and set a markup above or below the\nmarket price that lets you benefit from arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFurthermore, the script is designed to automatically republish your offers when\nthey expire, adhering to your predefined pricing strategy. This ensures that\nyour offers consistently reflect the current market rate, plus any additional\npremium you have chosen to apply.\n\n> Note: While this is currently made available as a companion script, we\nanticipate that many of its features will eventually be integrated into\nBasicSwap's core functionality.\nHow to Get Started\nTo get started, simply update your BasicSwap DEX instance. The script is\nincluded in the basicswap/scripts folder.\n\n * How to update BasicSwap DEX (Academy): \n   https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html\n * How to update BasicSwap DEX (Youtube): https://youtu.be/kk3FtE_TKBQ\n\nTo run the script, you’ll need to first edit the JSON template configuration\nfile (template_createoffers.json) included with the update to your liking, then\nrename it to createoffers.json. You can find the instructions on how to properly\nedit that file, as well as all possible variables, here\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_liquidity_bot.html] \non the Particl Academy.\n\nBasicSwap DEX Liquidity Tools Guide — Particl Academy latest documentationLearn\nhow to use the liquidity tools available for the BasicSwap DEX\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_liquidity_bot.html]\nOnce that’s done, simply run the script with the command python createoffers.py. \n\n> Note: The script needs to run continuously to be take effect. Closing the\nterminal tab that runs it will terminate it. \n\nFor this reason, we recommend executing the script using Byobu\n[https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-byobu-for-terminal-management-on-ubuntu-16-04] \nor Screen [https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen].\nConsiderations and Recommendations\n * For the script to correctly republish orders and update prices, it must keep\n   on running. Starting to script and then closing the terminal tab will shut it\n   down. As such, we recommend running it with a background task processor, such\n   as Byobu\n   [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-byobu-for-terminal-management-on-ubuntu-16-04] \n   or Screen [https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen] for example.\n * This script is best used in combination with a cloud-based version of\n   BasicSwap. When combined with a VPS setup, you can then ensure that both your\n   BasicSwap node and your script keep running 24/7, offering a true hands-off\n   approach to liquidity provision.

As such, it might not be ideal to set your offers as\n   “auto-accept” if you only intend on making one swap. We have a couple of\n   solutions to give the options to limit the number of swaps per order which\n   will come at a later stage, but for now, it’s important to be aware of this\n   behaviour.\n * Be careful about your configuration file’s formatting. JSON requires you to\n   keep the exact same indentations and logic, so watch out when editing the\n   file.\n * The script defaults to using adaptor signatures, which will cause issues if\n   you’re using a non-Segwit coin on the offering side (i.e., Firo, PIVX). In\n   those cases, make sure to configure the pair to use secret hash swaps by\n   putting \"swap_type\": \"secret_hash\" in the configuration file.\n * If you use the production (isolated) docker setup, you can bundle the script\n   with your BasicSwap launch sequence by adding it to your docker-compose\n   configuration file (\n   https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/docker/production/compose-fragments/8_script.yml\n   ).\n\nBecome a Liquidity Provider!\nLiquidity is fundamental to order book based exchanges, which is why we need\nyour assistance.

the open source BasicSwap DEX\nprotocol may have noticed some mentions of two different kinds of cross-chain\natomic swaps, namely “adaptor sig” swaps and “secret hash” swaps. \n\nThis article will explore the distinctions between the two kinds of swaps, their\ndifferences, and how the BasicSwap protocol leverages both to offer a truly\ndecentralized and remarkably private basis for decentralized exchanges.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat is an Atomic Swap?\nAn atomic swap, simply speaking, is a type of contract that enables a\ndecentralized cryptocurrency transaction. “Atomic”, in this case, implies that\nthe change of ownership of one asset should effectively imply the change of\nownership of the other. First conceptualized in 2013 by TierNolan on the\nBitcointalk forums\n[https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=193281.msg2003765#msg2003765], this\nfirst iteration of the concept, involving HTLCs (Hashed Time Lock Contracts),\nwould need four more years to finally see the light of day.\n\nAtomic swaps must involve two parties - as such, no third party or outside\nmiddleman can interrupt or interfere with the transaction. This characteristic\nmeans they are decentralized by nature and effectively immune to censorship, and\nas such are used in several decentralized exchanges, such as BasicSwap DEX and\nothers.\n\nIn the BasicSwap application, nearly all of the steps involved in both types of\nswaps happen seamlessly, at the back-end level. Furthermore, the initial\nagreement on the amounts and assets involved in any given swap between two\nparties is handled by its entirely distributed order book, powered by Particl's\nown encrypted mixnet, the SMSG network\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/].\n\nThe Original: Hashed Time Lock Contract (“Secret Hash”) Atomic Swaps\nThe first successful implementation of atomic swaps came from the Decred project\n[https://github.com/decred/atomicswap], leveraging \"hashlocks\" and \"timelocks\",\nwith the help of on-chain scripts (or smart contracts), to accomplish the atomic\nswap conceptualized by TierNolan years earlier. We refer to this type of swap as\na \"secret hash\" swap, or HTLC swap.\n\nTechnically speaking, the HTLC feature allows two users to conduct time-bound\ncryptocurrency transactions. This is highly relevant to this first\nimplementation of atomic swap technology, as the recipient must submit a\ncryptographic proof (the “secret”) to the contract within a set timeframe \n(established in number of blocks, or block height), or else the funds will be\nreturned to the sender. If the recipient acknowledges the payment, the\ntransaction is successful. This, as it happens, requires both participating\nblockchains to have both Hashlock and Timelock capabilities - a condition that\nleaves out certain blockchains, such as the notoriously rigid and hyper-private\nMonero blockchain.\n\nThese two key concepts may be summarized in the following way:\n\nA hashlock is a function of certain blockchains that restricts the spending of\nfunds until a certain piece of data is publicly disclosed (such as a\ncryptographic proof, in the form of a hash\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function]).\n\n\nA timelock is a function that restricts the spending of funds until a specific\ntime (or block height) in the future. This ensures that the transaction occurs\nwithin a given timeframe, and returns funds to the depositor if it is not\ncompleted, without a need for a third party adjudicator.\n\nThe graph below, sourced from Decred's implementation of atomic swaps, provides\na visual representation of the steps and necessary transfers of data that each\nparty performs:\n\n\n\nA HTLC (or \"secret hash\") atomic swap.\n\nIn other words, HTLC-based atomic swaps work as follows: \n\nAlice and Bob must first agree on the amounts and assets (e.g. Bitcoin and\nEther) to exchange. Alice then generates a random secret, s, and uses a\ncryptographic hash function to generate hash, h. She then creates an HTLC\ncontract using h, which locks up the Bitcoin. These coins can either be redeemed\n(spent) using the secret s, or they will be returned to her after a certain\namount of time, t, has passed. Bob does the same thing with his Ether on the\nother chain, locking it up in an HTLC using the same hash, h. Since Alice knows\nthe original secret, s, which was used to produce the hash, h, she can redeem\nthe Ether from Bob's HTLC. By doing so she reveals the secret s to Bob, who can\nthen take the Bitcoin and complete the swap.\n\nWithout diving too deep into the back-end inputs necessary to achieve a\nsuccessful HTLC swap as described in the graph above, the \"secret hash\" involved\nin them is the reason why HTLC swaps are sometimes referred to as \"Secret Hash\nswaps\". For the curious, more extensive documentation on the scripts involved in\nsecret hash swaps is available on the Decred atomic swap github page\n[https://github.com/decred/atomicswap].\n\nSome Shortcomings of Secret Hash Atomic Swaps\nAlthough they are a remarkable breakthrough in the space of decentralized \nexchange technologies, \"secret hash\" atomic swaps are not perfect: these atomic\nswap transactions, and thus, their associated data as well, take place on-chain,\nwhich has privacy implications that are particularly relevant to BasicSwap.\n\nWhenever a swap occurs, an identical hashed value will appear on both\nblockchains within a few blocks of each other — meaning that any moderately\nsophisticated passive observer of the two chains can easily link the coins\ninvolved in the swap, by finding identical hashes in blocks close to each other,\ntimestamp-wise. When the coins are tracked across chains, the provenance is\neasily established. Although there is no associated identity data revealed from\nsuch an analysis, it can potentially be trivial for third-parties to infer the\nidentity of the participants involved.\n\nThe Latest: Adaptor Signature (“Scriptless”) Atomic Swaps\nThe second type of atomic swap available on BasicSwap, dubbed \"adaptor sig\"\nswaps, is based on the work of Monero developer Joël \"h4sh3d\" Gugger, in a Sept.\n2020 paper titled \"Bitcoin–Monero Cross-chain Atomic Swap\"\n[https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126]. H4sh3d’s work can be said to be an\nimplementation of Lloyd Fournier’s work\n[https://github.com/LLFourn/one-time-VES/blob/master/main.pdf] on One-Time\nVerifiably Encrypted Signatures, A.K.A. Adaptor Signatures.\n\nThis type of swap is by necessity fundamentally different from HTLCs, because it\nis impossible for an XMR output to have an associated script. Therefore, a\ndifferent method, which relies in part on necessary prerequisites provided by\nthe non-XMR party, needs to be used to create the lock transaction. Note that\nthese prerequisites are such that the initiating party of the “adaptor sig” swap\nprotocol is only compatible with cryptocurrencies which use a bitcoin-style\ndecentralized UTXO model\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspent_transaction_output], and that have Segwit\nor a Segwit-equivalent malleability fix\n[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_malleability], such as Litecoin.\n\nThose \"scriptless\" swaps rely on a cryptographic technology known as an \"adaptor\nsignature\". In essence, without going too deep into the origins and underlying\nmath behind the technology, an adaptor signature is an additional signature that\nis combined with an initial signature to reveal a secret piece of data. Adaptor\nsignatures enable two parties to reveal two pieces of data to each other\nsimultaneously, and are the key building block of the kind of scriptless\nprotocols that render XMR atomic swap pairs possible.\n\nHow Does It Work?\nThis part of the article is particularly technical, but can shed some light on\nthe privacy distinctions between both swaps.\n\nThe graph below provides a visual representation of the steps and necessary\ntransfers of data that each party performs in an adaptor signature-based swap on\nBSX, from the offerer’s perspective. The green communication layer, in the case\nof BasicSwap, is handled by the SMSG network:\n\nAn \"adaptor sig\" atomic swap, from the Offerer's perspective.In other words,\nadaptor signature-based atomic swaps work as follows:\n\nAlice and Bob must first agree on the amounts and assets (e.g. BTC and XMR) to\nexchange. Just like in the case of “secret hash” swaps, this is achieved in a\nprivate and decentralized way in BasicSwap via its distributed order book.\n\nNote that a property of Monero is that the sum of public keys will match the\npublic key for the sum of private keys. By sending XMR to the sum of the public\nkeys they chose, Alice and Bob can create a lock tx similar to those used in the\nHLTC protocol.\n\nThe basic idea is:\n\nAlice and Bob each pick two secret (ECC) private keys (BTC and XMR), and swap\none set of public keys with each other. Here, three different keys are involved\nfor each side.\n\nAlice sends a BTC transaction with an output to a multisig output, which\nrequires a signature from both Alice and Bob in order to spend it. Once that\noccurs, Bob sees the BTC tx and sends the XMR tx to the XMR public key sum, as\nmentioned above.\n\nAlice signs for her private key and encumbers that signature with Bob's\nxmr_public_key.\n\nShe sends that adaptor signature to Bob. This adaptor signature is not a\ntransaction signature, so the transaction cannot be spent yet, but it does\ncommit to a secret value (Alice’s private key).\n\nBob then decodes the adaptor signature with his xmr_private key and then signs\nfor the BTC lock tx with his btc_private key.\n\nAs Bob now has a valid signature from Alice and himself, he can now spend from\nthe locked BTC tx.\n\nAlice watches the BTC chain for the tx that spends the lock tx. With Bob's\nsignature, which is broadcast publicly on the Bitcoin side once the Bitcoin\nlocked transaction is redeemed, she can recover Bob's xmr_private key.\n\nAlice, now endowed with both her and Bob's xmr_private keys, can spend from the\nXMR lock transaction, concluding the exchange.\n\n“****in’ VOILA” - Dr. Danny Duberstein accomplishing a BTC->XMR adaptor sig\natomic swap for the first time (allegedly)Some Advantages of Adaptor Signature\nSwaps\nAtomic swaps using adaptor signatures have several advantages over traditional\natomic swaps involving HTLCs.\n\nThe first thing to understand is that the adaptor signature swap scheme replaces\nthe on-chain scripts, involving timelocks and hashlocks, on which “secret hash”\nswaps rely on. In other words, the secret and secret-hash in a HTLC swap (as\ndetailed in the first graph) have no immediate parallel in adaptor sig swaps.\nThis particularity of adaptor signature technology is why their implementations\nare sometimes referred to as “scriptless scripts” within the Bitcoin research\ncommunity.\n\nSince no such script is involved, the on-chain footprint is reduced, which has\nthe non-negligible advantage of making the atomic swap more lightweight, and\ntherefore cheaper.\n\nFurthermore, contrary to HTLCs where the same hash has to be used on each chain,\ntransactions involved in an atomic swap using adaptor signatures cannot be\nlinked. This, again, is particularly relevant to BasicSwap’s privacy\nconsiderations [https://particl.news/privacy-and-liquidity-in-basicswap/],\ngranted that at least one of the two coins involved in the cross-chain swaps\nfulfills the prerequisites mentioned in the second paragraph of this article.\n\nThe Path Ahead for BSX: Two-Way Adaptor Signature Setup\nBecause scripts are not possible on blockchains like XMR, there are currently\nconstraints on which coin can initiate a swap on BSX. To trade Monero for\nBitcoin, for example, only the BTC-owning side can *initiate* a transaction. \n\nYet, because advance planning can be done consistent with atomic swapping, it is\nconceptually possible for both sides to effectively originate a swap:\n\nIf I have XMR and want, say, BTC, one could simply post a desire to do a trade \nas their offer. The BTC owner could then initiate the current, more formal\nprocess, still risk free. This process can be automated and be all but invisible\nto the front-end user experience, and is a major and very exciting upcoming item\non the BSX roadmap [https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap].\n\nTo Conclude…\nThe objective of this article is to provide a moderate but somewhat accessible\nunderstanding of why adaptor signature swaps can said to be a more private\nalternative to HTLC swaps, and how it protects swappers from any sort of\nmalicious passive observance by achieving the necessary smart contract logic for\nan atomic swap, without the use of on-chain script or hashed secrets. \n\nAs always, if you care about privacy as we do, we invite you to spread the word\nabout BasicSwap\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-dex/basicswap_explained.html]’s\nongoing open beta. It is free to use, open source, does not rely on native\ntokens, and involves absolutely no KYC or account requirements — this\narrangement offers only advantages for both you and the networks of the coins\nyou’re trading.\n\nEvery little bit helps, and we can all be a big part of this fight for our\nfreedoms and privacy. Even if this seems like a small step to you, bringing even\none person to trade their privacy coins on a decentralized exchange like BSX can\nhave a profound impact!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

First conceptualized in 2013 by <a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=193281.msg2003765#msg2003765\">TierNolan on the Bitcointalk forums</a>, this first iteration of the concept, involving HTLCs (Hashed Time Lock Contracts), would need four more years to finally see the light of day.</p><p>Atomic swaps must involve two parties - as such, no third party or outside middleman can interrupt or interfere with the transaction. This characteristic means they are decentralized by nature and effectively immune to censorship, and as such are used in several decentralized exchanges, such as BasicSwap DEX and others.</p><p>In the BasicSwap application, nearly all of the steps involved in both types of swaps happen seamlessly, at the back-end level. Furthermore, the initial agreement on the amounts and assets involved in any given swap between two parties is handled by its entirely distributed order book, powered by Particl's own encrypted mixnet, the <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/\">SMSG network</a>.</p><h2 id=\"the-original-hashed-time-lock-contract-secret-hash-atomic-swaps\">The Original: Hashed Time Lock Contract (“Secret Hash”) Atomic Swaps</h2><p>The first successful implementation of atomic swaps came <a href=\"https://github.com/decred/atomicswap\">from the Decred project</a>, leveraging \"hashlocks\" and \"timelocks\", with the help of on-chain scripts (or smart contracts), to accomplish the atomic swap conceptualized by TierNolan years earlier. We refer to this type of swap as a \"secret hash\" swap, or HTLC swap.</p><p>Technically speaking, the HTLC feature allows two users to conduct time-bound cryptocurrency transactions. This is highly relevant to this first implementation of atomic swap technology, as the recipient must submit a cryptographic proof (the “secret”) to the contract <strong>within a set timeframe</strong> (established in number of blocks, or block height), or else the funds will be returned to the sender. If the recipient acknowledges the payment, the transaction is successful. This, as it happens, requires both participating blockchains to have both <strong>Hashlock </strong>and <strong>Timelock </strong>capabilities - a condition that leaves out certain blockchains, such as the notoriously rigid and hyper-private Monero blockchain.</p><p>These two key concepts may be summarized in the following way:</p><p>A <strong>hashlock </strong>is a function of certain blockchains that restricts the spending of funds until a certain piece of data is publicly disclosed (such as a cryptographic proof, in the form of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function\">hash</a>).<br></p><p>A <strong>timelock </strong>is a function that restricts the spending of funds until a specific time (or block height) in the future. This ensures that the transaction occurs within a given timeframe, and returns funds to the depositor if it is not completed, without a need for a third party adjudicator.</p><p>The graph below, sourced from Decred's implementation of atomic swaps, provides a visual representation of the steps and necessary transfers of data that each party performs:</p><p></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2023/02/b8cfa1a1-d7ea-4f45-b79f-0609cff5889a.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2023/02/b8cfa1a1-d7ea-4f45-b79f-0609cff5889a.png 600w, /glink/2023/02/b8cfa1a1-d7ea-4f45-b79f-0609cff5889a.png 739w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>A HTLC (or \"secret hash\") atomic swap.</figcaption></figure><p></p><p>In other words, HTLC-based atomic swaps work as follows: </p><p>Alice and Bob must first agree on the amounts and assets (e.g. Bitcoin and Ether) to exchange. Alice then generates a random secret, s, and uses a cryptographic hash function to generate hash, <em>h</em>. She then creates an HTLC contract using <em>h</em>, which locks up the Bitcoin. These coins can either be redeemed (spent) using the secret <em>s</em>, or they will be returned to her after a certain amount of time, <em>t</em>, has passed. Bob does the same thing with his Ether on the other chain, locking it up in an HTLC using the same hash, <em>h</em>. Since Alice knows the original secret, <em>s</em>, which was used to produce the hash, <em>h</em>, she can redeem the Ether from Bob's HTLC. By doing so she reveals the secret <em>s</em> to Bob, who can then take the Bitcoin and complete the swap.</p><p>Without diving too deep into the back-end inputs necessary to achieve a successful HTLC swap as described in the graph above,<strong> the \"secret hash\" involved in them is the reason why HTLC swaps are sometimes referred to as \"Secret Hash swaps\"</strong>. For the curious, more extensive documentation on the scripts involved in secret hash swaps is available on the <a href=\"https://github.com/decred/atomicswap\">Decred atomic swap github page</a>.</p><h3 id=\"some-shortcomings-of-secret-hash-atomic-swaps\">Some Shortcomings of Secret Hash Atomic Swaps</h3><p>Although they are a remarkable breakthrough in the space of <strong>decentralized</strong> exchange technologies, \"secret hash\" atomic swaps are not perfect: these atomic swap transactions, and thus, their associated data as well, take place <strong>on-chain</strong>, which has privacy implications that are particularly relevant to BasicSwap.</p><p>Whenever a swap occurs, an identical hashed value will appear on both blockchains within a few blocks of each other — meaning that any moderately sophisticated passive observer of the two chains can easily link the coins involved in the swap, by finding identical hashes in blocks close to each other, timestamp-wise. When the coins are tracked across chains, the provenance is easily established. Although there is no associated identity data revealed from such an analysis, <strong>it can potentially be trivial for third-parties to infer the identity of the participants involved</strong>.</p><h2 id=\"the-latest-adaptor-signature-scriptless-atomic-swaps\">The Latest: Adaptor Signature (“Scriptless”) Atomic Swaps</h2><p>The second type of atomic swap available on BasicSwap, dubbed \"adaptor sig\" swaps, is based on the work of Monero developer Joël \"h4sh3d\" Gugger, in a Sept. 2020 paper titled <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126\">\"Bitcoin–Monero Cross-chain Atomic Swap\"</a>. H4sh3d’s work can be said to be an implementation of <a href=\"https://github.com/LLFourn/one-time-VES/blob/master/main.pdf\">Lloyd Fournier’s work</a> on One-Time Verifiably Encrypted Signatures, A.K.A. <strong>Adaptor Signatures</strong>.</p><p>This type of swap is by necessity fundamentally different from HTLCs, because it is impossible for an XMR output to have an associated script. Therefore, a different method, which relies in part on necessary prerequisites provided by the non-XMR party, needs to be used to create the lock transaction. Note that these prerequisites are such that the initiating party of the “adaptor sig” swap protocol is only compatible with cryptocurrencies which use a bitcoin-style decentralized <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspent_transaction_output\">UTXO model</a>, and that have Segwit or a Segwit-equivalent <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_malleability\">malleability fix</a>, such as Litecoin.</p><p>Those \"scriptless\" swaps rely on a cryptographic technology known as an \"adaptor signature\".

This, in part, means traders can\nmake or take orders at a price of their choosing and on their own terms.\n\nAt this stage of the beta, only full BasicSwap nodes — which need to be compiled\nand ran locally — are available to use. We are however working on deploying more\nconvenient solutions using light and web services as well as integration\ngateways.\n\nFor more in-depth information about BasicSwap, head over to this blog post\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/].\n\nCore Values\nBasicSwap’s unique exchange architecture introduces a lot of benefits for\ncryptocurrency users. Notably, its cross-chain approach radically improves the\nbroader blockchain ecosystem, by promoting healthier and more open trading\nconditions for all, without forcing users to use a specific coin or blockchain\nfor monetization purposes. BasicSwap aims to take down barriers and build\nbridges between various cryptocurrency communities.\n\nThe BasicSwap DEX is shaped by its uncompromising dedication to five core values\nthat we believe are bound to be in the interest of all traders:\n\n 1. Full custody of funds and keys;\n 2. A coin-agnostic architecture;\n 3. No trading fees or intermediary fees of any kind;\n 4. No accounts, limits, or restrictions;\n 5. Complete and total privacy.\n\nThese are the five constitutional values that make up the idea behind the\nBasicSwap protocol, and they guide every step of the way forward.\n\nFrom the Ground up — Uncompromising Commitment to Privacy\nBasicSwap is certainly not the first DEX around, but it does distinguish itself\nin its uncompromising commitment to user privacy. When we say BasicSwap is a\nprivacy-first DEX, it’s not just for buzz; we truly mean it.\n\nIndeed, BasicSwap is born out of a proof of concept\n[https://particl.news/monero-and-particl-atomic-swaps-775f87f6208a/] made 2\nyears ago when the Particl team began testing Monero atomic swaps\n[https://github.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap]. This eventually led to the\nrelease of a rudimentary DEX protocol that used Particl’s privacy-first SMSG\nnetwork, which eventually culminated into the more all-inclusive DEX platform\nthat we see today — complete with an order book and a modern, intuitive GUI.\n\nSuffice to say, privacy has always been at the core of BasicSwap’s history, and\nis its primary reason for existence. This holds true today more than ever.\n\nUnder the Hood\nBasicSwap is made up of a unique combination of leading-edge technologies in the\ndomains of blockchain, cryptography, and peer-to-peer networking. At no point\ndoes it use any centralized or intermediated components — ensuring the maximum\nlevel of security and privacy for all users and their hard-earned funds.\nCensorship, fraud, and misuse of user funds are fundamentally impossible from\nthe application to the protocol level.\n\nAtomic Swaps Atomic swaps have been around for quite some time and are an\nimportant part of many DEX platforms currently available online. They allow for\nswapping digital assets between two users in peer-to-peer fashion, assuming that\nthe logistical requirements behind executing such a swap exist. \n\nThe atomic swap technology is, in and of itself, a relatively narrow-scoped\nprotocol: it does not match orders between two users or provide any DEX\nframework whatsoever. It only safely swaps assets. \n\nFor a properly decentralized DEX to exist, it needs a common and decentralized\nchannel in which the information related to a swap is transferred between two\nparties — sometimes across two entirely different chains. Without this added\nlayer, it is impossible for a chain to know when to release the swap in question\nbecause it isn’t directly connected to the other blockchain. \n\nThis is often where some so-called “DEXs” cut corners and introduce a certain\nlevel of centralization. They offer decentralized swaps, but centralize the\nprocess of matching orders which entirely defeats the purpose of being a DEX in\nthe first place as it introduces a major central point of failure and control.\nIn the case of BasicSwap, this process remains entirely decentralized, thanks to\nthe SMSG network. \n\nMore detailed information on atomic swaps can be found here\n[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Atomic_swap]. \n\nin-progress waiting done SecureMessaging Network (SMSG) SecureMessaging (SMSG)\nis Particl’s own custom-built and unique P2P messaging network, which stands at\nthe core of its ecosystem. Inspired by the BitMessage Protocol\n[https://www.whonix.org/wiki/BitMessage], the SMSG network is a mixnet that acts\nas a decentralized storage network (DSN)\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/glossary.html#term-SecureMessaging-SMSG].\nAs such, it stores and transfers data across nodes in a privacy-preserving\nmanner, encrypted from end to end (E2EE), and without requiring the use of a\ncentral server. \n\nThis decentralized technology is essential in providing the BasicSwap DEX with\nfunctionality not provided by atomic swaps themselves, such as an order book and\norder matching system, as well as with transferring swap data between parties\nswapping from two different chains. \n\nWhen running a BasicSwap client, you are also automatically running an SMSG node\nalong with it. Any DEX and swap related data is then uploaded and downloaded\ndirectly from the SMSG network and interpreted by BasicSwap’s scriptless\nscripts, giving users a full-blown decentralized trading exchange (DEX)\nexperience. \n\nMore in-depth information about the SMSG protocol can be found here\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/] \n\nin-progress waiting done Scriptless Scripts Scriptless scripts are another key\naspect of BasicSwap and are a largely misunderstood and overlooked feature of\nBitcoin and blockchains in general. Originating from MimbleWimble, they are, in\ntheir basic sense, a way to execute secure and private smart contracts off-chain\nusing Schnorr Signatures [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature] or \nECDSA [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm]\n. \n\nIn the case of BasicSwap, two people send coins on a scriptless chain and into\nan address that's created from the sum of one private key from each of them.\nThat way, to spend that output requires them to cooperate through One-Time\nVerifiably Encrypted Signatures (OtVES)\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L154]\n. \n\n> \"A One-Time VES is a signature made invalid by mixing it with the public key of\nan encrypting key pair, a valid signature can be decrypted with knowledge of the\nprivate encrypting key and the private encrypting key can be recovered with\nknowledge of both the encrypted and plaintext signatures.\" Tecnovert — xmrswap\nprotocol notes\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L156] \n \n\n\nCompared to traditional on-chain smart contracts, scriptless scripts provide\nadded privacy and scalability. And compared to the rigid and barebone Bitcoin\nsmart contracts, they add a ton of functionality by allowing for much more\ncomplex and flexible, yet still securely tight, smart contracts. \n\nPrivacy: When on-chain, many details of a smart contract are shared to the\nentire network. These details include the number and addresses of participants\nand the amounts transferred, among other metadata. But because scriptless\nscripts are essentially smart contracts operating off-chain, most of the usage\ndata and user information is NOT shared with the rest of the network. The only\nthing that the network knows is that certain individuals are interacting with a\nsmart contract according to its pre-defined rules. However, depending on the\nspecific implementation, it is also possible for that information to be\ncompletely hidden. \n\nScalability: Smart contracts take up a lot of space on a blockchain. By moving\nthe smart contracting process off-chain, that data does not fill up and bloat\nthe blockchain, leading to much better scalability. The smart contracting\nprocess is also shared between scriptless scripts themselves and the SMSG\nnetwork. \n\nAdditionally, because scriptless scripts are eventually intended to leverage\nSchnorr Signatures, multiple keys can be aggregated into a single one — making\nthe actual smart contract code much lighter and more efficient than traditional\non-chain smart contracts. \n\nin-progress waiting done About the Open Beta Release\nBasicSwap’s open beta is now live, on mainnet, for everyone. That means you can\nnow set up the DEX and start trading with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Monero,\nand others without middlemen, without restrictions, and with no need to worry\nabout the custody of your coins.\n\nConsiderations — What to Expect at This Beta Stage\nThe release of the open beta is a major milestone for BasicSwap, but it is by no\nmeans intended as the final version of it. Indeed, we have much bigger plans for\nit, which you can get a hint at by checking out our roadmap\n[https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap].\n\nIndeed, we feel it is important to put emphasis on the beta aspect of this\nrelease. As such, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:\n\n * It may lack features that you’d like to see in the future.\n * It may feel unfinished or unpolished in some areas.\n * It still needs to be manually compiled.\n * It requires full coin nodes to be synced up and run locally.\n * It requires your node to stay online to complete swaps.\n * It requires your node to stay online for your offers to show up on the books.\n * It requires coin wallets to be unlocked when running.\n\nAll of the considerations mentioned above are merely temporary obstacles that we\nfully plan on resolving as we progress through this open beta phase. Consult\nour\nroadmap [https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap], scheduled to release this coming\nMonday, to get a better understanding of our plans moving forward and of the\nways we intend to improve the platform.\n\nRoadmap and Vision — What’s Next?\nWhile the open beta release of BasicSwap is a major milestone in its journey,\nthe best is yet to come. Indeed, BasicSwap is poised to evolve into a major,\nunstoppable DEX platform with significant innovations that will benefit the\nentire crypto ecosystem.\n\nGenerally speaking, the team will focus on four major technical items moving\nforward, with various other additions, improvements, and fixes along the way.\n\n * SMSG 2.0 — For better scalability, privacy, and efficiency;\n * Integration frameworks — To integrate BasicSwap into third-party platforms,\n   web apps, and more;\n * Privacy-centric updates — To improve user privacy and fund security;\n * Lightning Network — For near-instant swap speed (on eligible coins) and\n   capabilities.\n\nThese are the cornerstone items of our current roadmap. They are the most\nsignificant milestones and the keys to BasicSwap’s vision. While we work on\nthese, you can expect a wide variety of non-related features and improvements to\nalso be added.\n\nAdditionally, we fully plan on adding more coins to the platform as demand for\nit comes our way. As such, we’ve set up a listing application form\n[https://forms.gle/UZhdUJAXdEumVdBi8] on our website that can be filled out to\nrequest new coin listings. Note that, due to BasicSwap’s unique architecture and\nour current development resources, we cannot guarantee a fast integration\nprocess for all coins that apply, but we’ll do our best to work with you on\nthese matters.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo here we are - BasicSwap’s open beta is finally upon us. If you want to\ncontribute to the DEX revolution and help take the power away from those\ngatekeepers best known as centralized exchanges, then spread the word far and\nwide and bring your liquidity on a fair, open, and honest platform for all!\n\nAs more people use decentralized exchanges, liquidity will grow, which will\ncontribute to bringing better, more free trading conditions for all crypto\nusers. A winning scenario for all users of cryptocurrencies and participants in\nthe new digital economy.\n\nBig thank you to all for participating in this open beta, and for anchoring\nyourself in history. We can’t wait to hear about your feedback and see the\nplatform and its usage grow over time!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

These details include the number and addresses of participants and the amounts transferred, among other metadata. But because scriptless scripts are essentially smart contracts operating off-chain, most of the usage data and user information is NOT shared with the rest of the network. The only thing that the network knows is that certain individuals are interacting with a smart contract according to its pre-defined rules. However, depending on the specific implementation, it is also possible for that information to be completely hidden.\n            <br><br>\n            <b>Scalability:</b> Smart contracts take up a lot of space on a blockchain. By moving the smart contracting process off-chain, that data does not fill up and bloat the blockchain, leading to much better scalability. The smart contracting process is also shared between scriptless scripts themselves and the SMSG network.\n            <br><br>\n            Additionally, because scriptless scripts are eventually intended to leverage Schnorr Signatures, multiple keys can be aggregated into a single one — making the actual smart contract code much lighter and more efficient than traditional on-chain smart contracts.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    </div><!-- tabs close-->\n  </div><!-- col close-->\n</div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id=\"about-the-open-beta-release\">About the Open Beta Release</h2><p><strong>BasicSwap’s open beta is now live</strong>, on mainnet, for everyone. That means you can now set up the DEX and start trading with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Monero, and others without middlemen, without restrictions, and with no need to worry about the custody of your coins.</p><h3 id=\"considerations-what-to-expect-at-this-beta-stage\">Considerations — What to Expect at This Beta Stage</h3><p>The release of the open beta is a major milestone for BasicSwap, but it is by no means intended as the final version of it. Indeed, we have much bigger plans for it, which you can get a hint at by <a href=\"https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap\"><strong>checking out our roadmap</strong></a>.</p><p>Indeed, we feel it is important to put emphasis on the beta aspect of this release. As such, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>It may lack features that you’d like to see in the future.</li><li>It may feel unfinished or unpolished in some areas.</li><li>It still needs to be manually compiled.</li><li>It requires full coin nodes to be synced up and run locally.</li><li>It requires your node to stay online to complete swaps.</li><li>It requires your node to stay online for your offers to show up on the books.</li><li>It requires coin wallets to be unlocked when running.</li></ul><p>All of the considerations mentioned above are merely <strong>temporary obstacles</strong> that we fully plan on resolving as we progress through this open beta phase. <a href=\"https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap\"><strong>Consult our roadmap</strong></a>, scheduled to release this coming Monday, to get a better understanding of our plans moving forward and of the ways we intend to improve the platform.</p><h2 id=\"roadmap-and-vision-what-s-next\">Roadmap and Vision — What’s Next?</h2><p>While the open beta release of BasicSwap is a major milestone in its journey, the best is yet to come. Indeed, BasicSwap is poised to evolve into a major, unstoppable DEX platform with significant innovations that will benefit the entire crypto ecosystem.</p><p>Generally speaking, the team will focus on four major technical items moving forward, with various other additions, improvements, and fixes along the way.</p><ul><li><strong>SMSG 2.0 — </strong>For better scalability, privacy, and efficiency;</li><li><strong>Integration frameworks —</strong> To integrate BasicSwap into third-party platforms, web apps, and more;</li><li><strong>Privacy-centric updates — </strong>To improve user privacy and fund security;</li><li><strong>Lightning Network —</strong> For near-instant swap speed (on eligible coins) and capabilities.</li></ul><p>These are the cornerstone items of our current roadmap. They are the most significant milestones and the keys to BasicSwap’s vision. While we work on these, you can expect a wide variety of non-related features and improvements to also be added.</p><p>Additionally, we fully plan on adding more coins to the platform as demand for it comes our way. As such, we’ve set up a <a href=\"https://forms.gle/UZhdUJAXdEumVdBi8\">listing application form</a> on our website that can be filled out to request new coin listings. Note that, due to BasicSwap’s unique architecture and our current development resources, we cannot guarantee a fast integration process for all coins that apply, but we’ll do our best to work with you on these matters.</p><hr><p>So here we are - BasicSwap’s open beta is finally upon us. If you want to contribute to the DEX revolution and help take the power away from those gatekeepers best known as centralized exchanges, then spread the word far and wide and bring your liquidity on a fair, open, and honest platform for all!</p><p>As more people use decentralized exchanges, liquidity will grow, which will contribute to bringing better, more free trading conditions for all crypto users. A winning scenario for all users of cryptocurrencies and participants in the new digital economy.</p><p>Big thank you to all for participating in this open beta, and for anchoring yourself in history. We can’t wait to hear about your feedback and see the platform and its usage grow over time!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

Notably, its cross-chain approach radically improves the broader blockchain ecosystem, by promoting healthier and more open trading conditions for all, without forcing users to use a specific coin or blockchain for monetization purposes. BasicSwap aims to take down barriers and build bridges between various cryptocurrency communities.</p><p>The BasicSwap DEX is shaped by its uncompromising dedication to five core values that we believe are bound to be in the interest of all traders:</p><ol><li>Full custody of funds and keys;</li><li>A coin-agnostic architecture;</li><li>No trading fees or intermediary fees of any kind;</li><li>No accounts, limits, or restrictions;</li><li>Complete and total privacy.</li></ol><p>These are the five constitutional values that make up the idea behind the BasicSwap protocol, and they guide every step of the way forward.</p><h3 id=\"from-the-ground-up-uncompromising-commitment-to-privacy\">From the Ground up — Uncompromising Commitment to Privacy</h3><p>BasicSwap is certainly not the first DEX around, but it does distinguish itself in its uncompromising commitment to user privacy. When we say BasicSwap is a privacy-first DEX, it’s not just for buzz; we truly mean it.</p><p>Indeed, BasicSwap is born out of a <a href=\"https://particl.news/monero-and-particl-atomic-swaps-775f87f6208a/\">proof of concept</a> made 2 years ago when the Particl team began testing <a href=\"https://github.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap\">Monero atomic swaps</a>. This eventually led to the release of a rudimentary DEX protocol that used Particl’s privacy-first SMSG network, which eventually culminated into the more all-inclusive DEX platform that we see today — complete with an order book and a modern, intuitive GUI.</p><p>Suffice to say, privacy has always been at the core of BasicSwap’s history, and is its primary reason for existence. This holds true today more than ever.</p><h3 id=\"under-the-hood\">Under the Hood</h3><p>BasicSwap is made up of a unique combination of leading-edge technologies in the domains of blockchain, cryptography, and peer-to-peer networking. At no point does it use any centralized or intermediated components — ensuring the maximum level of security and privacy for all users and their hard-earned funds. Censorship, fraud, and misuse of user funds are fundamentally impossible from the application to the protocol level.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center full light-one\" id=\"btn-add_01\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"col\">\n    <div class=\"tabs\">\n      <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">Atomic Swaps</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Atomic swaps have been around for quite some time and are an important part of many DEX platforms currently available online.

That way, to spend that output requires them to cooperate through <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L154\">One-Time Verifiably Encrypted Signatures (OtVES)</a>.\n            <br><br>\n            <i></i></p><blockquote cite=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L156\"><i>\"A One-Time VES is a signature made invalid by mixing it with the public key of an encrypting key pair, a valid signature can be decrypted with knowledge of the private encrypting key and the private encrypting key can be recovered with knowledge of both the encrypted and plaintext signatures.\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L156\">Tecnovert — xmrswap protocol notes</a> </i></blockquote>\n            <br><br>\n            Compared to traditional on-chain smart contracts, scriptless scripts provide added privacy and scalability. And compared to the rigid and barebone Bitcoin smart contracts, they add a ton of functionality by allowing for much more complex and flexible, yet still securely tight, smart contracts.\n            <br><br>\n            <b>Privacy:</b> When on-chain, many details of a smart contract are shared to the entire network. These details include the number and addresses of participants and the amounts transferred, among other metadata. But because scriptless scripts are essentially smart contracts operating off-chain, most of the usage data and user information is NOT shared with the rest of the network. The only thing that the network knows is that certain individuals are interacting with a smart contract according to its pre-defined rules. However, depending on the specific implementation, it is also possible for that information to be completely hidden.\n            <br><br>\n            <b>Scalability:</b> Smart contracts take up a lot of space on a blockchain. By moving the smart contracting process off-chain, that data does not fill up and bloat the blockchain, leading to much better scalability. The smart contracting process is also shared between scriptless scripts themselves and the SMSG network.\n            <br><br>\n            Additionally, because scriptless scripts are eventually intended to leverage Schnorr Signatures, multiple keys can be aggregated into a single one — making the actual smart contract code much lighter and more efficient than traditional on-chain smart contracts.\n            <p></p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n\n    </div><!-- tabs close-->\n  </div><!-- col close-->\n</div><!-- row close-->\n</div><!-- acc close--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id=\"about-the-open-beta-release\">About the Open Beta Release</h2><p><strong>BasicSwap’s open beta is now live</strong>, on mainnet, for everyone. That means you can now set up the DEX and start trading with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Monero, and others without middlemen, without restrictions, and with no need to worry about the custody of your coins.</p><h3 id=\"considerations-what-to-expect-at-this-beta-stage\">Considerations — What to Expect at This Beta Stage</h3><p>The release of the open beta is a major milestone for BasicSwap, but it is by no means intended as the final version of it. Indeed, we have much bigger plans for it, which you can get a hint at by <a href=\"https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap\"><strong>checking out our roadmap</strong></a>.</p><p>Indeed, we feel it is important to put emphasis on the beta aspect of this release. As such, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>It may lack features that you’d like to see in the future.</li><li>It may feel unfinished or unpolished in some areas.</li><li>It still needs to be manually compiled.</li><li>It requires full coin nodes to be synced up and run locally.</li><li>It requires your node to stay online to complete swaps.</li><li>It requires your node to stay online for your offers to show up on the books.</li><li>It requires coin wallets to be unlocked when running.</li></ul><p>All of the considerations mentioned above are merely <strong>temporary obstacles</strong> that we fully plan on resolving as we progress through this open beta phase. <a href=\"https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap\"><strong>Consult our roadmap</strong></a>, scheduled to release this coming Monday, to get a better understanding of our plans moving forward and of the ways we intend to improve the platform.</p><h2 id=\"roadmap-and-vision-what-s-next\">Roadmap and Vision — What’s Next?</h2><p>While the open beta release of BasicSwap is a major milestone in its journey, the best is yet to come. Indeed, BasicSwap is poised to evolve into a major, unstoppable DEX platform with significant innovations that will benefit the entire crypto ecosystem.</p><p>Generally speaking, the team will focus on four major technical items moving forward, with various other additions, improvements, and fixes along the way.</p><ul><li><strong>SMSG 2.0 — </strong>For better scalability, privacy, and efficiency;</li><li><strong>Integration frameworks —</strong> To integrate BasicSwap into third-party platforms, web apps, and more;</li><li><strong>Privacy-centric updates — </strong>To improve user privacy and fund security;</li><li><strong>Lightning Network —</strong> For near-instant swap speed (on eligible coins) and capabilities.</li></ul><p>These are the cornerstone items of our current roadmap. They are the most significant milestones and the keys to BasicSwap’s vision. While we work on these, you can expect a wide variety of non-related features and improvements to also be added.</p><p>Additionally, we fully plan on adding more coins to the platform as demand for it comes our way. As such, we’ve set up a <a href=\"https://forms.gle/UZhdUJAXdEumVdBi8\">listing application form</a> on our website that can be filled out to request new coin listings. Note that, due to BasicSwap’s unique architecture and our current development resources, we cannot guarantee a fast integration process for all coins that apply, but we’ll do our best to work with you on these matters.</p><hr><p>So here we are - BasicSwap’s open beta is finally upon us. If you want to contribute to the DEX revolution and help take the power away from those gatekeepers best known as centralized exchanges, then spread the word far and wide and bring your liquidity on a fair, open, and honest platform for all!</p><p>As more people use decentralized exchanges, liquidity will grow, which will contribute to bringing better, more free trading conditions for all crypto users. A winning scenario for all users of cryptocurrencies and participants in the new digital economy.</p><p>Big thank you to all for participating in this open beta, and for anchoring yourself in history. We can’t wait to hear about your feedback and see the platform and its usage grow over time!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

After a successful and productive closed beta testing\nround, BasicSwap is now ready to publicly move to its open beta phase!\n\nIndeed, on the 8th of December at 15:00 UTC, the privacy-first and cross-chain\nDEX will go live, allowing everyone to trade cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin,\nMonero, Particl and others on an entirely distributed protocol, without third\nparty involvement of any kind.\n\nThis blog post will reveal everything you need to know about the upcoming beta\nlaunch, so make sure that you don’t skip on it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Contents\n * What’s BasicSwap\n * Open Beta Release Information\n * BasicSwap Website and Roadmap\n * What’s Next?\n\nNote: If you’re already familiar with BasicSwap, you may want to immediately\njump to this section containing all the information you need to know ahead of\nthe open beta release.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s BasicSwap\n> The Privacy-First and Cross-Chain DEX That Wants to Free Crypto\nAs bold the above statement may sound, this really is what BasicSwap is setting\nout to do.\n\nBasicSwap is a distributed cryptocurrency exchange protocol that lets you trade\ndifferent cryptocurrencies without the use of third-parties or middlemen using\nwhat is known as ‘atomic swaps’.\n\nThe DEX works using an order book system, in contrast to the liquidity pool\n(i.e. AMM) approach\n[https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm] \nthat most other DEXs have opted for. This, in part, means traders can make or\ntake orders at a price of their choosing and on their own terms.\n\nAt this stage of the beta, only full BasicSwap nodes — which need to be compiled\nand run locally — are available to use. We are however working on deploying more\nconvenient solutions using light and web services as well as integration\ngateways.\n\nFor more in-depth information about BasicSwap, head over to this blog post\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/].\n\nCore Values\nBasicSwap’s unique exchange architecture introduces a lot of benefits for\ncryptocurrency users. Notably, its cross-chain approach radically improves the\nbroader blockchain ecosystem, by promoting healthier and open trading conditions\nfor all, without forcing users to use a specific coin or blockchain for\nmonetization purposes. BasicSwap aims to take down barriers and build bridges\nbetween various cryptocurrency communities.\n\nThe BasicSwap DEX is shaped by its uncompromising dedication to five core values\nthat are bound to be in the interest of all traders:\n\n 1. Full custody of funds and keys;\n 2. A coin-agnostic architecture;\n 3. No trading fees or intermediary fees of any kind;\n 4. No accounts, limits, or restrictions;\n 5. Complete and total privacy.\n\nThese are the five constitutional values that make up the idea behind the\nBasicSwap protocol, and they guide every step of the way forward.\n\nFrom the Ground up — Uncompromising Commitment to Privacy\nBasicSwap is certainly not the first DEX around, but it does distinguish itself\nin its uncompromising commitment to user privacy. When we say BasicSwap is a\nprivacy-first DEX, it’s not just for buzz; we truly mean it.\n\nIndeed, BasicSwap is born out of a proof of concept\n[https://particl.news/monero-and-particl-atomic-swaps-775f87f6208a/] made 2\nyears ago when the Particl team began testing Monero atomic swaps\n[https://github.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap]. This eventually led to the\nrelease of a rudimentary DEX protocol that used Particl’s privacy-first SMSG\nnetwork, which eventually culminated into the more all-inclusive DEX platform\nthat we see today — complete with an order book and a modern, intuitive GUI.\n\nSuffice to say, privacy has always been at the core of BasicSwap’s history, and\nis its primary reason for existence. This holds true today more than ever with\nthe planned addition of several privacy-enhancing protocols such as Taproot,\nSMSG 2.0, Lightning Network, and more. \n\nUnder the Hood\nBasicSwap is made up of a unique combination of leading-edge technologies in the\ndomains of blockchain, cryptography, and peer-to-peer networking. At no point\ndoes it use any centralized or intermediated components — ensuring the maximum\nlevel of security and privacy for all users and their hard-earned funds.\nCensorship, fraud, and misuse of user funds are fundamentally impossible from\nthe application to the protocol level.\n\nAtomic Swaps Atomic swaps have been around for quite some time and are an\nimportant part of many DEX platforms currently available online. They allow for\nswapping digital assets between two users in peer-to-peer fashion, assuming that\nthe logistical requirements behind executing such a swap exist. \n\nThe atomic swap technology is, in and of itself, a relatively narrow-scoped\nprotocol: it does not match orders between two users or provide any DEX\nframework whatsoever. It only safely swaps assets. \n\nFor a properly decentralized DEX to exist, it needs a common and decentralized\nchannel in which the information related to a swap is transferred between two\nparties — sometimes across two entirely different chains. Without this added\nlayer, it is impossible for a chain to know when to release the swap in question\nbecause it isn’t directly connected to the other blockchain. \n\nThis is often where some so-called “DEXs” cut corners and introduce a certain\nlevel of centralization. They offer decentralized swaps, but centralize the\nprocess of matching orders which entirely defeats the purpose of being a DEX in\nthe first place as it introduces a major central point of failure and control.\nIn the case of BasicSwap, this process remains entirely decentralized, thanks to\nthe SMSG network. \n\nMore detailed information on atomic swaps can be found here\n[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Atomic_swap]. \n\nin-progress waiting done SecureMessaging Network (SMSG) SecureMessaging (SMSG)\nis Particl’s own custom-built and unique P2P messaging network, which stands at\nthe core of its ecosystem. Inspired by the BitMessage Protocol\n[https://www.whonix.org/wiki/BitMessage], the SMSG network is a mixnet that acts\nas a decentralized storage network (DSN)\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/glossary.html#term-SecureMessaging-SMSG].\nAs such, it stores and transfers data across nodes in a privacy-preserving\nmanner, encrypted from end to end (E2EE), and without requiring the use of a\ncentral server. \n\nThis decentralized technology is essential in providing the BasicSwap DEX with\nfunctionality not provided by atomic swaps themselves, such as an order book and\norder matching system, as well as with transferring swap data between parties\nswapping from two different chains. \n\nWhen running a BasicSwap client, you are also automatically running an SMSG node\nalong with it. Any DEX and swap related data is then uploaded and downloaded\ndirectly from the SMSG network and interpreted by BasicSwap’s scriptless\nscripts, giving users a full-blown decentralized trading exchange (DEX)\nexperience. \n\nMore in-depth information about the SMSG protocol can be found here\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/] \n\nin-progress waiting done Scriptless Scripts Scriptless scripts are another key\naspect of BasicSwap and are a largely misunderstood and overlooked feature of\nBitcoin and blockchains in general. Originating from MimbleWimble, they are, in\ntheir basic sense, a way to execute secure and private smart contracts off-chain\nusing Schnorr Signatures [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature] or \nECDSA [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm]\n. \n\nIn the case of BasicSwap, two people send coins on a scriptless chain and into\nan address that's created from the sum of one private key from each of them.\nThat way, to spend that output requires them to cooperate through One-Time\nVerifiably Encrypted Signatures (OtVES)\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L154]\n. \n\n> \"A One-Time VES is a signature made invalid by mixing it with the public key of\nan encrypting key pair, a valid signature can be decrypted with knowledge of the\nprivate encrypting key and the private encrypting key can be recovered with\nknowledge of both the encrypted and plaintext signatures.\" Tecnovert — xmrswap\nprotocol notes\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/implementation_notes/notes.tex#L156] \n \n\n\nCompared to traditional on-chain smart contracts, scriptless scripts provide\nadded privacy and scalability. And compared to the rigid and barebone Bitcoin\nsmart contracts, they add a ton of functionality by allowing for much more\ncomplex and flexible, yet still securely tight, smart contracts. \n\nPrivacy: When on-chain, many details of a smart contract are shared to the\nentire network. These details include the number and addresses of participants\nand the amounts transferred, among other metadata. But because scriptless\nscripts are essentially smart contracts operating off-chain, most of the usage\ndata and user information is NOT shared with the rest of the network. The only\nthing that the network knows is that certain individuals are interacting with a\nsmart contract according to its pre-defined rules. However, depending on the\nspecific implementation, it is also possible for that information to be\ncompletely hidden. \n\nScalability: Smart contracts take up a lot of space on a blockchain. By moving\nthe smart contracting process off-chain, that data does not fill up and bloat\nthe blockchain, leading to much better scalability. The smart contracting\nprocess is also shared between scriptless scripts themselves and the SMSG\nnetwork. \n\nAdditionally, because scriptless scripts are eventually intended to leverage\nSchnorr Signatures, multiple keys can be aggregated into a single one — making\nthe actual smart contract code much lighter and more efficient than traditional\non-chain smart contracts. \n\nin-progress waiting done Open Beta Release Information\nOn 08/12/2022 at 15:00 UTC, BasicSwap’s open beta goes live, on mainnet, for\neveryone. That means you’ll be able to set up the DEX and start trading with\ncryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Monero, and others without middlemen, without\nrestrictions, and with no need to worry about the custody of your coins.\n\nConsiderations — What to Expect on Launch Day\nThe release of the open beta is a major milestone for BasicSwap, but it is by no\nmeans intended as the final version of BasicSwap.\n\nIndeed, we feel it is important to put emphasis on the beta aspect of this\nrelease. As such, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:\n\n * It may lack features that you’d like to see in the future.\n * It may feel unfinished or unpolished in some areas.\n * It still needs to be manually compiled.\n * It requires full coin nodes to be synced up and run locally.\n * It requires your node to stay online to complete swaps.\n * It requires your node to stay online for your offers to show up on the books.\n * It requires coin wallets to be unlocked when running.\n\nAll of the considerations mentioned above are merely temporary obstacles that we\nfully plan on resolving as we progress through this open beta phase. Consult our\nroadmap, scheduled to release this coming Wednesday, to get a better\nunderstanding of our plans moving forward and of the ways we intend to improve\nthe platform.\n\nClosed Beta Status\nThe “closed beta” phase refers to a round of testing we’ve run with a select\ngroup of testers from the community. This phase concludes on 08/12/2022 at 15:00\nwith the launch of the open beta.\n\nHowever, we are happy to report that we now have a feature freeze on BasicSwap\nas of several days ago\n[https://twitter.com/BasicSwapDEX/status/1593691361731018754?s=20&t=MghrOuho2YRbk8HKAneQFQ]\n, meaning there won’t be new additions or updates until the open beta release.\nThis is to ensure a stable launch free of any last minute issues.\n\n> Today, we're putting the #BasicSwap\n[https://twitter.com/hashtag/BasicSwap?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] #DEX\n[https://twitter.com/hashtag/DEX?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] under \"feature\nfreeze\" until its open beta launch!\n\nFocus is now exclusively on the big release ?\n\nCOMING NEXT: Release date announcement! ?#DEXRevolution\n[https://twitter.com/hashtag/DEXRevolution?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] #FTX\n[https://twitter.com/hashtag/FTX?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] #NoMoreCEX\n[https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoMoreCEX?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]\n\n— BasicSwap DEX (@BasicSwapDEX) November 18, 2022\n[https://twitter.com/BasicSwapDEX/status/1593691361731018754?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]\nWebsite and Roadmap Go Live on Wednesday!\nBasicSwapDEXMeet BasicSwap, the privacy-first and cross-chain DEX. Swap coins\nlike Bitcoin and Monero on a trading platform that’s free, unstoppable, and\nconfidential. By the Particl Project.BasicSwapDEX [https://basicswapdex.com/]\nWe’re also excited to announce the upcoming release of BasicSwap’s own website — \nBasicSwapDEX.com [https://basicswapdex.com/] — this coming Wednesday the 30th of\nNovember, 2022. It intends on communicating in a clear and concise manner what\nBasicSwap is, what benefits one can expect from it, and how to use it.\n\nEqually as important, it is also meant to be centric in Particl’s current and\nfuture BasicSwap-related marketing efforts — serving as both a landing page and\neducational portal for any newfound curious minds.\n\nIf you want to tell others about BasicSwap, then the Particl Academy\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-dex/basicswap_explained.html] \nand BasicSwapDEX.com [http://basicswapdex.com] are the best ways to go about it!\n\nRoadmap to be Published\nBundled with the release of the website will be the publication of a\nBasicSwap-specific product roadmap. Due to the ever-evolving blockchain\nlandscape acting as a moving target, the roadmap will be presented as a set of\nnon-linear achievements for maximum flexibility and adaptability.\n\nWhat’s Next for BasicSwap?\nWhile the open beta release of BasicSwap is a major milestone in its journey,\nthe best is yet to come. Indeed, BasicSwap is poised to evolve into a major,\nunstoppable DEX platform with significant innovations that will benefit the\nentire crypto ecosystem.\n\nGenerally speaking, the team will focus on four major technical items moving\nforward, with various other additions, improvements, and fixes along the way.\n\n * SMSG 2.0 — For better scalability, privacy, and efficiency;\n * Integration frameworks — To integrate BasicSwap into third-party platforms,\n   web apps, and more;\n * Privacy-centric updates — To improve user privacy and fund security;\n * Lightning Network — For near-instant swap speed (on eligible coins) and\n   capabilities.\n\nThese are the cornerstone items of our current roadmap. They are the most\nsignificant milestones and the keys to BasicSwap’s vision. While we work on\nthese, you can expect a wide variety of non-related features and improvements to\nalso be added.\n\nAdditionally, we fully plan on adding more coins to the platform as demand for\nit comes our way. As such, we’ve set up a listing application form\n[https://forms.gle/UZhdUJAXdEumVdBi8] on our website that can be filled out to\nrequest new coin listings. Note that, due to BasicSwap’s unique architecture and\nour current development resources, we cannot guarantee a fast integration\nprocess for all coins that apply, but we’ll do our best to work with you on\nthese matters.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo there it is, the official open beta release date is now announced and mere\ndays stand before its launch! If you want to contribute to the DEX revolution\nand help take the power away from those gatekeepers best known as “centralized\nexchanges”, then help us spread the word far and wide!\n\nAs more people use decentralized exchanges, liquidity will grow, contributing to\nbringing better, more free trading conditions for all!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

Indeed, BasicSwap is poised to evolve into a major, unstoppable DEX platform with significant innovations that will benefit the entire crypto ecosystem.</p><p>Generally speaking, the team will focus on four major technical items moving forward, with various other additions, improvements, and fixes along the way.</p><ul><li><strong>SMSG 2.0 — </strong>For better scalability, privacy, and efficiency;</li><li><strong>Integration frameworks —</strong> To integrate BasicSwap into third-party platforms, web apps, and more;</li><li><strong>Privacy-centric updates — </strong>To improve user privacy and fund security;</li><li><strong>Lightning Network —</strong> For near-instant swap speed (on eligible coins) and capabilities.</li></ul><p>These are the cornerstone items of our current roadmap. They are the most significant milestones and the keys to BasicSwap’s vision. While we work on these, you can expect a wide variety of non-related features and improvements to also be added.</p><p>Additionally, we fully plan on adding more coins to the platform as demand for it comes our way. As such, we’ve set up a <a href=\"https://forms.gle/UZhdUJAXdEumVdBi8\"><strong>listing application form</strong></a> on our website that can be filled out to request new coin listings. Note that, due to BasicSwap’s unique architecture and our current development resources, we cannot guarantee a fast integration process for all coins that apply, but we’ll do our best to work with you on these matters.</p><hr><p>So there it is, the official open beta release date is now announced and mere days stand before its launch!

Notably, its cross-chain approach radically improves the broader blockchain ecosystem, by promoting healthier and open trading conditions for all, without forcing users to use a specific coin or blockchain for monetization purposes. BasicSwap aims to take down barriers and build bridges between various cryptocurrency communities.</p><p>The BasicSwap DEX is shaped by its uncompromising dedication to five core values that are bound to be in the interest of all traders:</p><ol><li>Full custody of funds and keys;</li><li>A coin-agnostic architecture;</li><li>No trading fees or intermediary fees of any kind;</li><li>No accounts, limits, or restrictions;</li><li>Complete and total privacy.</li></ol><p>These are the five constitutional values that make up the idea behind the BasicSwap protocol, and they guide every step of the way forward.</p><h3 id=\"from-the-ground-up-uncompromising-commitment-to-privacy\">From the Ground up — Uncompromising Commitment to Privacy</h3><p>BasicSwap is certainly not the first DEX around, but it does distinguish itself in its uncompromising commitment to user privacy. When we say BasicSwap is a privacy-first DEX, it’s not just for buzz; we truly mean it.</p><p>Indeed, BasicSwap is born out of a <a href=\"https://particl.news/monero-and-particl-atomic-swaps-775f87f6208a/\"><strong>proof of concept</strong></a> made 2 years ago when the Particl team began testing <a href=\"https://github.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap\"><strong>Monero atomic swaps</strong></a>. This eventually led to the release of a rudimentary DEX protocol that used Particl’s privacy-first SMSG network, which eventually culminated into the more all-inclusive DEX platform that we see today — complete with an order book and a modern, intuitive GUI.</p><p>Suffice to say, privacy has always been at the core of BasicSwap’s history, and is its primary reason for existence. This holds true today more than ever with the planned addition of several privacy-enhancing protocols such as Taproot, SMSG 2.0, Lightning Network, and more. </p><h3 id=\"under-the-hood\">Under the Hood</h3><p>BasicSwap is made up of a unique combination of leading-edge technologies in the domains of blockchain, cryptography, and peer-to-peer networking. At no point does it use any centralized or intermediated components — ensuring the maximum level of security and privacy for all users and their hard-earned funds. Censorship, fraud, and misuse of user funds are fundamentally impossible from the application to the protocol level.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"acc nwidth center full light-one\" id=\"btn-add_01\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"col\">\n    <div class=\"tabs\">\n      <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck1\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck1\">Atomic Swaps</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            Atomic swaps have been around for quite some time and are an important part of many DEX platforms currently available online. They allow for swapping digital assets between two users in peer-to-peer fashion, assuming that the logistical requirements behind executing such a swap exist.\n            <br><br> \n            The atomic swap technology is, in and of itself, a relatively narrow-scoped protocol: it does not match orders between two users or provide any DEX framework whatsoever. It only safely swaps assets.\n            <br><br>\n            For a properly decentralized DEX to exist, it needs a common and decentralized channel in which the information related to a swap is transferred between two parties — sometimes across two entirely different chains. Without this added layer, it is impossible for a chain to know when to release the swap in question because it isn’t directly connected to the other blockchain.\n            <br><br>\n            This is often where some so-called “DEXs” cut corners and introduce a certain level of centralization. They offer decentralized swaps, but centralize the process of matching orders which entirely defeats the purpose of being a DEX in the first place as it introduces a major central point of failure and control. In the case of BasicSwap, this process remains entirely decentralized, thanks to the SMSG network.\n            <br><br>\n            More detailed information on atomic swaps can be found \n            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Atomic_swap\">here</a>.\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"tags disabled\">\n            <span class=\"tag active\">in-progress</span>\n            <span class=\"tag gr inactive\">waiting</span>\n            <span class=\"tag done\">done</span>\n            </div><!-- tags-content close-->\n        </div><!-- tab-content close-->\n      </div><!-- tab close-->\n        \n      <div class=\"tab\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cat1_chck2\">\n        <label class=\"tab-label\" for=\"cat1_chck2\">SecureMessaging Network (SMSG)</label>\n        <div class=\"tab-content\">\n            <p>\n            SecureMessaging (SMSG) is Particl’s own custom-built and unique P2P messaging network, which stands at the core of its ecosystem.

That means you’ll be able to set up the DEX and start trading with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Monero, and others without middlemen, without restrictions, and with no need to worry about the custody of your coins.</p><h3 id=\"considerations-what-to-expect-on-launch-day\">Considerations — What to Expect on Launch Day</h3><p>The release of the open beta is a major milestone for BasicSwap, but it is by no means intended as the final version of BasicSwap.</p><p>Indeed, we feel it is important to put emphasis on the beta aspect of this release. As such, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>It may lack features that you’d like to see in the future.</li><li>It may feel unfinished or unpolished in some areas.</li><li>It still needs to be manually compiled.</li><li>It requires full coin nodes to be synced up and run locally.</li><li>It requires your node to stay online to complete swaps.</li><li>It requires your node to stay online for your offers to show up on the books.</li><li>It requires coin wallets to be unlocked when running.</li></ul><p>All of the considerations mentioned above are merely temporary obstacles that we fully plan on resolving as we progress through this open beta phase. Consult our roadmap, scheduled to release this coming Wednesday, to get a better understanding of our plans moving forward and of the ways we intend to improve the platform.</p><h3 id=\"closed-beta-status\">Closed Beta Status</h3><p>The “closed beta” phase refers to a round of testing we’ve run with a select group of testers from the community. <strong>This phase concludes on 08/12/2022 at 15:00 with the launch of the open beta.</strong></p><p>However, we are happy to report that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BasicSwapDEX/status/1593691361731018754?s=20&#x26;t=MghrOuho2YRbk8HKAneQFQ\"><strong>we now have a feature freeze on BasicSwap as of several days ago</strong></a>, meaning there won’t be new additions or updates until the open beta release. This is to ensure a stable launch free of any last minute issues.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today, we're putting the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BasicSwap?src=hash&#x26;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BasicSwap</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DEX?src=hash&#x26;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DEX</a> under \"feature freeze\" until its open beta launch!<br><br>Focus is now exclusively on the big release ?<br><br>COMING NEXT: Release date announcement! ?<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DEXRevolution?src=hash&#x26;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DEXRevolution</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FTX?src=hash&#x26;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FTX</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoMoreCEX?src=hash&#x26;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NoMoreCEX</a></p>— BasicSwap DEX (@BasicSwapDEX) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BasicSwapDEX/status/1593691361731018754?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 18, 2022</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</figure><h2 id=\"website-and-roadmap-go-live-on-wednesday-\">Website and Roadmap Go Live on Wednesday!</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://basicswapdex.com/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">BasicSwapDEX</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Meet BasicSwap, the privacy-first and cross-chain DEX.

It intends on communicating in a clear and concise manner what BasicSwap is, what benefits one can expect from it, and how to use it.</p><p>Equally as important, it is also meant to be centric in Particl’s current and future BasicSwap-related marketing efforts — serving as both a landing page and educational portal for any newfound curious minds.</p><p>If you want to tell others about BasicSwap, then the <strong><a href=\"https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-dex/basicswap_explained.html\">Particl Academy</a> </strong>and <a href=\"http://basicswapdex.com\"><strong>BasicSwapDEX.com</strong></a> are the best ways to go about it!</p><h3 id=\"roadmap-to-be-published\">Roadmap to be Published</h3><p>Bundled with the release of the website will be the publication of a BasicSwap-specific product roadmap. Due to the ever-evolving blockchain landscape acting as a moving target, the roadmap will be presented as a set of non-linear achievements for maximum flexibility and adaptability.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next-for-basicswap\">What’s Next for BasicSwap?</h2><p>While the open beta release of BasicSwap is a major milestone in its journey, the best is yet to come. Indeed, BasicSwap is poised to evolve into a major, unstoppable DEX platform with significant innovations that will benefit the entire crypto ecosystem.</p><p>Generally speaking, the team will focus on four major technical items moving forward, with various other additions, improvements, and fixes along the way.</p><ul><li><strong>SMSG 2.0 — </strong>For better scalability, privacy, and efficiency;</li><li><strong>Integration frameworks —</strong> To integrate BasicSwap into third-party platforms, web apps, and more;</li><li><strong>Privacy-centric updates — </strong>To improve user privacy and fund security;</li><li><strong>Lightning Network —</strong> For near-instant swap speed (on eligible coins) and capabilities.</li></ul><p>These are the cornerstone items of our current roadmap. They are the most significant milestones and the keys to BasicSwap’s vision. While we work on these, you can expect a wide variety of non-related features and improvements to also be added.</p><p>Additionally, we fully plan on adding more coins to the platform as demand for it comes our way. As such, we’ve set up a <a href=\"https://forms.gle/UZhdUJAXdEumVdBi8\"><strong>listing application form</strong></a> on our website that can be filled out to request new coin listings. Note that, due to BasicSwap’s unique architecture and our current development resources, we cannot guarantee a fast integration process for all coins that apply, but we’ll do our best to work with you on these matters.</p><hr><p>So there it is, the official open beta release date is now announced and mere days stand before its launch! If you want to contribute to the DEX revolution and help take the power away from those gatekeepers best known as “centralized exchanges”, then help us spread the word far and wide!</p><p>As more people use decentralized exchanges, liquidity will grow, contributing to bringing better, more free trading conditions for all!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

with the creation of the \"first altcoin\", Litecoin, people have been\npondering and developing ways to swap their favorite digital assets without\nrelying on third-parties — the goal being an efficient, simple and private way\nto swap Bitcoin for Litecoin, or Monero, or any other cryptocurrency, that holds\nthe same values as a traditional P2P cryptocurrency transaction. The immediate\nproblem is that these cryptocurrencies generally reside on separate blockchains,\nwhich do not offer a lot of interoperability.\n\nDevelopers and tech entrepreneurs of all kinds have spotted this need in the\nmarket and went to work trying to bring to life a series of decentralized\ntrading exchanges — often abbreviated as \"DEX\".  This led to an increase in the\nnumber of DEXs and decentralized trading protocols which, in truth, really have\nlarge degrees of variation between them in terms of decentralization or even\nstraight up usability.\n\nOne thing that can be observed is that, even today with dozens upon dozens of\nDEXs, a substantial quantity of them focus exclusively on intra-chain swaps,\nmeaning swapping different assets belonging to the same chain together. Those\nare unfortunately very restricted in their swapping abilities, and do not fix\nthe underlying issues regarding important but perhaps more difficult to\nintegrate blockchains like Monero.\n\nCrossing the Chain Barrier\nTo many users, the details of how such cross-chain trades are accomplished under\nthe hood is not very much on their mind — and the distinction may even seem\nfutile. The rebuttal is obvious; “But what about X and Y exchanges that claim to\nbe able to make cross-chain swaps? After all, I can swap BTC for CAKE on the\nBinance Smart Chain!\" Unfortunately, in nearly all cases, the interoperability\noffered by cross-chain DEXs does not function in a way that is optimal to those\nusers’ interests. And that's especially true for those who need additional\nprivacy protections for their asset swaps, or simply those who are serious about\ndecentralization and privacy.\n\nThere is a sad pattern we can often observe with lots of \"new-wave\" DEXs: many\nbold but ultimately lacking claims of interoperability without third parties are\nput forward. The way many of these DEXs achieve cross-chain compatibility is\ngenerally by adopting an illusory strategy which really ends up being a travesty\nboth in terms of decentralization and of security.\n\nA common strategy attempted to achieve that promise is the \"wrapping\", or\n\"mirroring\", of assets. With this strategy, the process of swapping can indeed\nbe decentralized, but what you are ultimately left with is a wrapped asset on\nthe very same chain you've initiated the swap from. A wrapped asset is a token\non a smart-contract chain that is allegedly backed by the asset it claims to be\nmirroring.\n\nThe original asset is held, in custody, by a third-party which then issues a\ntoken worth exactly that asset (an IOU). The smart contract holds the custodian\nto its promise that it will pay you back the original asset once you redeem it\nin exchange for the wrapped asset. But as we well know, \"not your keys, not your\ncoins”.\n\nUnfortunately, if the custodian loses access to your coins (which has happened\nin the past\n[https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/stakehound-loses-private-keys/]) there is\nabsolutely no recourse. The custodian is even in a position to possibly reverse\nor freeze your transactions\n[https://cryptocurrencynewsroom.com/tether-can-reverse-and-control-your-usdt/] \nthemselves, or lock you out from accessing your hard-earned assets\n[https://fortune.com/2022/03/07/coinbase-blocks-25000-crypto-wallets-russians-sanctions/]\n. The possibility of this, we can all agree, is straying very far from anything\ndecentralized and the original ethos of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnother common strategy involves atomic swaps – this, however, comes with\nimportant challenges when dealing certain pairs or highly different blockchains,\nor with particularly rigid blockchains such as Monero.\n\nThe Challenges of Atomic Swaps and DEXs\nAtomic swaps have been around for quite some time, having been first proposed\nin\n2013\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/lukefitzpatrick/2019/09/02/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-atomic-swaps/?sh=50fc82761784]\n. They allow two parties who don't know each other to safely swap\ncryptocurrencies without the use of a third-party. The process is time and\ncondition based — hence “atomic” — and any failure to remain honest or forgo\none's end of the deal automatically results in the assets being refunded to\ntheir original owner. It is, by design, impossible to cheat someone when doing\natomic swaps.\n\nBut even with atomic swaps, true, uncompromised decentralization is very hard to\nachieve when you want to swap one cryptocurrency to another one from an entirely\ndifferent chain. Notably, attempting to interact with highly privacy-centric\ncoins such as Monero, which has a famously rigid but incredibly private\nblockchain structure, leaves us with very few user-friendly and decentralized\nalternatives: often requiring users to run a Monero node, a Bitcoin node, both,\nor deal with highly complicated experimental protocols lacking in even basic\nGUI.\n\nAtomic swaps on their own are not enough for our purposes. In order to acquire\ntrue cross-chain operability on a bona fide exchange, and without giving in an\ninch on decentralization and privacy, atomic swaps require a secondary network,\nor layer, to coordinate some level of information between chains. That is\nprecisely where a huge challenge lies, and why atomic swaps have not been widely\navailable between two chains (especially involving Monero) as of yet.\n\nThat’s in major part what motivated us to build BasicSwap\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/] — a \ncross-chain, truly decentralized, and privacy-first DEX. When you trade, say,\nBitcoin to Monero on the BasicSwap orderbook, no extensive node configuration is\nneeded, and absolutely no wrapping of assets takes place. We instead made true\ncross-chain swaps possible by combining two groundbreaking protocols; atomic\nswaps, and Particl’s own SMSG mixnet network\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/].\n\nBasicSwap — The Fully Private Cross-Chain DEXMatch and settle cryptocurrency\ntrades in a trustless setup without any central point of failure or fee.Particl\nNewscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/]SMSG: A layer\n2 Solution for Cross-Chain Interoperability\nBitcoin advocates often mention the role of cross-chain operability will be\nfilled by the Lightning Network. Years have passed and, although we are seeing\nnominal progress on that end, it is unfortunately very slow and still\ncomplicated to setup. But because the ability to swap cryptocurrencies with full\nprivacy is of dire need in this day and age, we’ve decided to take control of\nthings and build exactly a solution for that: BasicSwap.\n\nSecureMessaging (SMSG)\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/glossary.html#term-SecureMessaging-SMSG],\na P2P messaging network inspired by BitMessage and developed by the particl.io\nteam, is what powers the BasicSwap DEX in place of the Lightning Network.\n\nIt acts as the required messaging layer for the accomplishment of BasicSwap’s\ntruly decentralized cross-chain DEX. SMSG is a simple message mixnet, where all\nnodes store a copy of everyone's end-to-end encrypted messages for a limited\nperiod of time. The sender of a message cannot exactly pinpoint the IP address\nof the receiver, because the messages defuse over the entire network.\n\nAll nodes attempt to decrypt every incoming message - if the HMAC\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC]check fails, then the message was either\nfraudulent or not addressed for you. This technology allowed us to successfully\nbuild a powerful and truly cross-chain DEX, that works using atomic swaps and \n'scriptless scripts'\n[https://wiki.ion.radar.tech/tech/research/scriptless-scripts-schnorr].\n\nThis allows BasicSwap to relay vital atomic swap information from one chain to\nan entirely different one, even Monero, in a seamless and user-friendly manner\nand without coin wrapping, custodian entity, or any other centralized\nenvironment. This layer 2 acts as a powerful, entirely distributed bridge\nbetween chains that otherwise have nothing in common — an uncompromisingly\ndistributed alternative with incredible potential for easy-to-use third-party\nintegrations and contributions.\n\nTo learn more about BasicSwap, refer to this in-depth blog post\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/] or have a\nlook at its section on the Particl Academy\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-dex/basicswap_explained.html]!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo here we stand today - trying to move the ball forward, always, towards a new\nera of decentralized cryptocurrency trading. An era where centralized,\ninstitutionalized, corporate “exchanges\" and the substantial security\nliabilities they involve are simply not needed anymore. An era where everyone is\nfree to trade whatever asset they want, efficiently and without third-parties.\n\nIf you want to help us build a freer world and more sane cryptocurrency trading\nconditions for all, we invite you to come test BasicSwap’s open beta, which goes\nlive imminently, and send us your feedback.

excited to announce that we’ve successfully completed BasicSwap’s user\ninterface (GUI v0.1), meaning that the final closed beta testing round has now\nbegun! ?\n\nThis is an important milestones and the last step before the public release of\nthe open beta, so make sure to read this blog post in full to get all the\ndetails and get a better idea of what to expect in the next few days to come!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat is BasicSwap?\nBasicSwap — The Fully Private Cross-Chain DEXMatch and settle cryptocurrency\ntrades in a trustless setup without any central point of failure or fee.Particl\nNewscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/]BasicSwap is\na cross-chain and private decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol and a trading\napp that allows you to swap one cryptocurrency for another without any middleman\nor third-party being involved.\n\nIt lets you make or take orders on a distributed order book and execute swaps\nthat are safe, trustless, unrestricted, and private. All of this combined sets\nBasicSwap apart as a DEX with uncompromising ease of use, security and\ndecentralization, and creates an environment that is totally free of any central\npoint of failure. Best of all: there are absolutely no trading fees!\n\nWe’ve already published an extensive blog post explaining everything you need\nto\nknow about BasicSwap\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-the-fully-private-cross-chain-dex/]. So if you\nwant more information on this upcoming breakthrough DEX, make sure to give it a\nread!\n\nAbout BasicSwap’s User Interface\nAs you may already be aware, the BasicSwap back-end protocol (\"swap engine\") has\nbeen operational as an early beta software for a while, allowing mainnet swaps\nto take place between a range of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin,\nParticl and even Monero.\n\nHowever, what it lacked, up until today, was a user-friendly and easy-to-use\ninterface to facilitate the act of trading on the platform. As we’ve often seen\nwithin the blockchain industry, the user experience is of the utmost importance.\n\nThat’s why we’ve opted to wait until BasicSwap’s user-friendly GUI was ready\nbefore publicly releasing the beta. And now that this is done, we enter a new\nphase for BasicSwap!\n\nThe Final Closed Beta Testing Round Begins Today\nWith the first version of the BasicSwap GUI now completed (v0.1), we have now\nbegun the final closed beta testing round before the public launch of the open\nbeta.\n\nDuring this final round, we’ll thoroughly test the user interface across a wide\nrange of environments and scenarios as well as the DEX protocol itself. This\nwill ensure the smoothest and most hassle-free open beta launch (public)\npossible.\n\nWhat’s BasicSwap’s Status?\nBasicSwap is a beta product and still under development. The release of the open\nbeta is a major milestone in its development but it is by no means a completed\nproduct.\n\nAs such, there may be missing features, quirks in the user experience, and areas\nof improvement. This is normal at this stage, and that’s precisely where we need\nyou!\n\nIf, during the upcoming open beta, you encounter any issue, bug, or discover\nareas of improvements, be sure to let us know by logging it on the DEX’s issue\npage [https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/issues]. This also applies to\ngeneral comment, feedback, and suggestions; they are the entire reason for an\nopen beta!\n\nIssues · tecnovert/basicswapBasic Atomic Swap Proof of Concept. Contribute to\ntecnovert/basicswap development by creating an account on GitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/issues]We are working hard on building\nthe most resilient, private, and decentralized DEX platform for all and your\nhelp and contributions are vital in making this happen!\n\nWhen is BasicSwap Expected to Launch Publicly?\nIt isn’t possible to confirm the precise public launch date yet.
