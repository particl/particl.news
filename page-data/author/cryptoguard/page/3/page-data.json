we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nParticl Team Proposal #5\nOur fifth community funding proposal, which aims to finance the ongoing\noperations of current Particl and BasicSwap contributors as well as cover\nnetwork-related expenses, is still in its discussion phase.\n\nYou can review the proposal [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/24] \nin detail on the CCS platform, or for a more detailed overview, read the \nassociated blog post [https://particl.news/particl-team-funding-request-5/] on\nParticl News which provides additional context and information.\n\nWith discussions surrounding the proposal having subsided, we will soon schedule\nits voting phase and communicate the details to the community as a few days\nbefore it begins.\n\nParticl Marketplace Update ?\nThis week's efforts regarding the marketplace moderation system has once again\nbeen spent on testing and improving the system, notably with how the app\ninteracts with the distributed LLM network.\n\nThis is an important step as automated, LLM-driven moderation can have wide\nranging impact on the marketplace, and so must be done right.\n\nAt this time, we're looking to expand the LLM options made available to users to\nimprove the reliability of the moderation as well as incorporating a few new\nfunctions as a result of our testing.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nAdaptor Signature Code Conversion ?\nThis week, our back-end efforts have primarily focused on converting BasicSwap's\nPython code to C++, particularly modules related to adaptor signatures. \n\nThis extensive and time-consuming process is crucial for making BasicSwap's\nbidirectional adaptor signature swaps compatible with portable versions of the\nDEX, such as mobile or web applications. You can refer to past weekly updates\nfor more information on this item here\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-30-08-2024/#integration-layer-]\n.\n\nUser Interface  ?️\nWith our front-end developer back in full health, we've made progress on items\nslated for the next user interface update. We're finalizing the following\nimprovements, which will be gradually rolled out on GitHub (dev branch) over the\nnext day or two:\n\n 1. Refactoring of the JavaScript code for the Network Offers (order book) page,\n    providing:\n\n * Greater flexibility for current and future price and rate displays\n * Improved API key management and usage\n * A more streamlined price chart\n\n2. Bug fix for the shutdown button, preventing DEX shutdown during active swaps\n\n3. Improvements to the Create New Offers page, including better rate display\n(replacing the JSON-style format)\n\n4. Upgraded notification system\n\nMoving forward, we plan to implement a strategy of smaller, more frequent\nupdates on GitHub, rather than waiting to bundle larger updates. This approach\nwill facilitate easier participation from open-source contributors as the\ncodebase evolves.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nParticl Team Proposal #5\nOur fifth community funding proposal, which aims to finance the ongoing\noperations of current Particl and BasicSwap contributors as well as cover\nnetwork-related expenses, is still in its discussion phase.\n\nYou can review the proposal [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/24] \nin detail on the CCS platform, or for a more detailed overview, read the \nassociated blog post [https://particl.news/particl-team-funding-request-5/] on\nParticl News which provides additional context and information.\n\nWith discussions surrounding the proposal having resurfaced throughout the week,\nwe opted to keep the proposal in its discussion phase for a little more time.\nHowever, we do expect to move it to the voting phase shortly, and we'll\ncommunicate the details to the community as promptly as possible.\n\nParticl Marketplace Update ?\nThis week's efforts regarding the marketplace moderation system has been spent\non testing and improving the system, notably with how the app interacts with the\ndistributed LLM network.\n\nAs such, work on the system is still ongoing as we're making changes as they are\nrequired. \n\nTo provide maximum clarity about the architecture of this system, its\nimplications, and the way it is expected to be used by users that wish to\nparticipate in moderating the marketplace, we plan to publish a detailed blog\npost on Particl News which will cover all the basics. However, we are waiting\nfor the system to be completed and ready to be deployed first to allow us the\nflexibility to make any necessary adjustments to the system's components before\nrelease.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nOrder Book Monitoring ?️\nWe've made further progress on the system to extract and publicly broadcast data\nfrom BasicSwap's order book that was mentioned last week. This data can be used\nto display BasicSwap-related information in various formats, such as the more\nCEX-like order book interface shown in the screenshot above.\n\nIn the near future, we plan to make this interface accessible at \noffers.basicswapdex.com, including the ability to fetch rates without running\nBasicSwap locally, a feature that will benefit third-party contributors looking\nto utilize this data for a variety of reasons.\n\nWe also plan integrating, later on, this type of order book display directly\ninto BasicSwap as an additional way to view the order book. Note, however, that\nwe do intend on maintaining the current \"marketplace-like\" interface as well,\nproviding users with multiple viewing options.\n\nUser Interface  ?️\nWork continues on BasicSwap's broader set of user interface updates. However,\njust like last week, our front-end development efforts have been divided between\nthis task and the aforementioned data processing work. As a result, while the\nupcoming GUI updates are still in progress, we expect to release them soon.\n\nIntegration Layer ?\nWe have begun the process of converting portions of the BasicSwap codebase to\nC++. This conversion is a crucial step towards integrating adaptor signature\natomic swaps into third-party platforms.\n\nWhile it's challenging to provide a precise timeline for this task, it\nrepresents a significant milestone in our roadmap, achieving our goals of:\n\n 1. Making BasicSwap compatible with third-party platforms,\n 2. Significantly improving the user experience by integrating the DEX's\n    protocol to portable platforms, such as mobile applications.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nParticl Team Proposal #5\nLast week, we published our fifth community funding proposal which aims to\nfinance the ongoing operations of current Particl and BasicSwap contributors, as\nwell as cover network-related expenses.\n\nYou can review the proposal [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/24] \nin detail on the CCS platform, or for a more detailed overview, read the \nassociated blog post [https://particl.news/particl-team-funding-request-5/] on\nParticl News which provides additional context and information.\n\nWith discussions surrounding the proposal having subsided, it's time to move\nforward with the voting process to determine its approval by Particl\nstakeholders. We will soon schedule the proposal's voting period and communicate\nthe details to the community as promptly as possible.\n\nParticl Marketplace Update ?\nWe have made good progress in merging the listing scanner API with the\nAI-powered moderation system. While this integration is still ongoing and\nrequires further testing, we are pleased with the advancements made this week on\nthat end.\n\nThe listing scanner API has now been merged with the AI-powered moderation\nsystem, with the latter now being mostly complete. We are currently testing the\nsystem and will proceed to start connecting to the marketplace to ensure that\nvotes on listings are properly broadcast to the network.\n\nTo provide maximum clarity about the architecture of this system, its\nimplications, and the way it is expected to be used by users that wish to\nparticipate in moderating the marketplace, we plan to publish a detailed blog\npost on Particl News which will cover all the basics. However, we are waiting\nfor the system to be completed and ready to be deployed first to allow us the\nflexibility to make any necessary adjustments to the system's components before\nrelease.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nOrder Book Monitoring ?️\nBasicSwap front-end developer, Crz, has begun work on a system to extract and\npublicly broadcast data from BasicSwap's order book. This development will allow\ncontributors to access and utilize various data points for multiple use cases\nwithout the need to run a local version of BasicSwap.\n\nThe tool will offer greater insight and visibility into available liquidity on\nBasicSwap DEX and the relationships between different offers, enabling\ncontributors to seamlessly integrate the data into their own products or\napplications.\n\nExample of use-case leveraging extracted BasicSwap data (traditional CEX-like\nUI)As illustrated above, the data encompasses a wide range of properties and can\nbe applied to diverse scenarios, including alternative order book display\nmethods, rate comparisons, market depth analysis, and more.\n\nUser Interface  ?️\nWhile we've pushed a minor GUI fix with regards to QR code, we've continued work\non BasicSwap's larger user interface update coming up soon, although time on\nthat end has been shared with building the aforementioned data broadcasting\nsystem.\n\nAs such, the upcoming GUI updates are still work-in-progress but should be\nreleased shortly.\n\nIntegration Layer ?\nThis week, we've continued R&D with regards to messaging protocols in the\ncontext of a more portable version of BasicSwap (via the integration layer).\nWe're currently exploring tapping directly into the SMSG network, without\nrequiring a local SMSG node, which would provide the ability to use SMSG without\nrunning a Particl node on portable (mobile) devices. \n\nWhile possible, we are currently testing what sort of performance using such a\nsetup would result in, and if realistically usable, will likely end up being how\nportable versions of BasicSwap allow peers to communicate swap data with each\nother and access the DEX's order book (with alternative messaging layers being\nimplemented as a secondary priority).\n\nAdditionally, we have begun research and early work into converting some of\nBasicSwap's components into C++, a requirement to allow for portable versions of\nBasicSwap that include adaptor signature atomic swaps and not just HTLC ones.\nWork on that end is likely to take a couple of weeks.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nParticl Team Proposal #5 \nTeam Funding Proposal #5Learn all the details about the Particl team’s fifth\nfunding request from the Treasury Fund.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particl-team-funding-request-5/]Earlier this week, we\npublished our fifth community funding proposal which aims to finance the ongoing\noperations of current Particl and BasicSwap contributors, as well as cover\nnetwork-related expenses.\n\nYou can review the proposal [https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/24] \nin detail on the CCS platform, or for a more detailed overview, read the \nassociated blog post [https://particl.news/particl-team-funding-request-5/] on\nParticl News which provides additional context and information.\n\nIf you have questions, comments, or feedback regarding the proposal, feel free\nto discuss it within the community channels or leave a direct comment on the CCS\nproposal page (https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/24).\n\nParticl Marketplace Update ?\nWe have made good progress in merging the listing scanner API with the\nAI-powered moderation system. While this integration is still ongoing and\nrequires further testing, we are pleased with the advancements made this week on\nthat end.\n\nUpon completion of this merger, our next step will be to connect the new\nmoderation system to the marketplace itself, ensuring that nodes properly\nbroadcast their votes when they need to and that they're applied to the relevant\nlistings.\n\nTo provide maximum clarity about the architecture of this system, its\nimplications, and the way it is expected to be used by users that wish to\nparticipate in moderating the marketplace, we plan to publish a detailed blog\npost on Particl News which will cover all the basics. However, we are waiting\nfor the system to be completed and ready to be deployed first to allow us the\nflexibility to make any necessary adjustments to the system's components before\nrelease.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nUser Interface  ?️\nWe've unfortunately hit some delays pushing the fixes we wanted to over the week\nas our front-end developer has been mostly unavailable due to health reasons.\nFor this reason, the GUI-related section of this progress report remains the\nsame as it was last week.\n\nThat means we're still gearing up to push a minor update in the next couple of\ndays that will fix a few bugs and include a few improvements, notably to the\ndisplay of QR codes in some cases.\n\nFurthermore, we're hoping for a release of the larger GUI update we've been\nworking on for the past few weeks somewhere next week, if all goes well.\n\nThis larger update will soon be available on GitHub and, as always, and you'll\nbe able to test the changes before they go live by switching to the dev branch.\nThe smaller update, however, will be available directly from the master branch.\n\nIntegration Layer ?\nWe have continued our investigation into the integration of new, alternative\nmessaging protocols into BasicSwap. This would serve two primary purposes: to\nfacilitate the integration of BasicSwap into third-party applications, which\ncarry their own restrictions, and to provide a backup solution to SMSG in\nscenarios where scalability becomes an issue, such as during a sudden,\nsignificant increase in the number of swaps.\n\nAt this time, we are evaluating several options and are also considering\nstandardizing the integration of messaging layers, which could lead to a\nplugin-like system. This approach would allow users to select their preferred\nmessaging layers in the options, but it is still unclear whether or not that\nwill be the preferable path to follow. While our exploration in this area is\nongoing, we have made satisfactory progress in our research and expect to be\nable to take a decision about it shortly.\n\nAdditionally, following discussions with potential partners, we are reviewing\nsections of the BasicSwap codebase that will likely need to be converted into\ndifferent programming languages to ensure proper integration of the DEX into\nthese third-party platforms and to leverage their infrastructure (e.g.,\nintegrated light node). Although this may involve a substantial amount of work,\nit is crucial for simplifying future integrations and improving fundamental\naspects of the codebase at the same time.\n\nIt's important to note that while we do have several individual components\nrequired for this integration layer either in place or at various stages of\ndevelopment, we are still in the early phases of this process and haven't yet\nfully transitioned out of the R&D phase. As such, we may need to refine or\niterate these components as we progress.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nParticl Marketplace Update ?\nWe have completed development of a market listing scanner that enables the new,\nimproved moderation system to extract relevant information and feed it into a\ndistributed network of Large Language Model (LLM) for moderation purposes.\n\nOur current focus is now on integrating the two systems — the market scanner and\nthe LLM-powered moderation tool. Once this integration is complete, we will be\nready to deploy the new system.\n\nIt's important to note that the new moderation tool is entirely optional; no\nuser will be required to run it nor will it come pre-packaged with or\nenabled-by-default in Particl Core. Additionally, moderation policies are fully\ncustomizable and are set by the individual user running an instance of this\nsystem. These policies are defined using natural language, thus allowing for a\nvery intuitive setup.\n\nWe want to emphasize that our team does not, and will not, enforce specific\nmoderation policies or maintain a ban list. Decentralization is a fundamental\nprinciple in everything we do at Particl, and we are committed to upholding this\nvalue.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nUser Interface  ?️\nWe're gearing up to push a minor update in the next day or two that will fix a\nfew bugs and include a few improvements, notably to the display of QR codes in\nsome cases.\n\nFuthermore, we're hoping for a release of the larger GUI update we've been\nworking on for the past few weeks somewhere next week, if all goes well.\n\nThis larger update will soon be available on GitHub and, as always, and you'll\nbe able to test the changes before they go live by switching to the dev branch.\nThe smaller update, however, will be available directly from the master branch.\n\nIntegration Layer ?\nWe're currently exploring a new, alternative messaging protocol for the purpose\nof integrating BasicSwap into third-party applications more easily as well as to\nprovide a fallback solution to SMSG in cases where it wouldn't scale enough\n(e.g., a sudden massive spike in the number of swaps).\n\nThis research is part of our ongoing efforts in building BasicSwap's integration\nlayer, which is the next major milestone for the DEX and the Particl ecosystem\nas a whole. \n\nIn the interest of deploying integratable BasicSwap-powered solutions to\npartners more quickly, we are considering a phased approach. For instance, this\nstrategy may involve initially enabling UTXO <> UTXO swaps using HTLC (\"Secret\nHash\") atomic swaps, followed by a gradual implementation of the broader range\nof features and capabilities offered by BasicSwap over time.\n\nIt's important to note that, while we do have individual components required for\nthis integration layer either in place or at various stages of development, we\nare still in the early phases of this process.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nParticl Marketplace Update ?\nWe're currently working on a marketplace message scanner to extract the relevant\ninformation that needs to be analyzed by the LLM-powered moderation script. This\nis our current focus as the portion of the work relating to the LLM logic is now\ncomplete and awaiting the delivery of the scanner.\n\nOnce completed, the next step will be to merge it with the marketplace-related\ncomponent of the system, and then test it extensively before release.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nUser Interface  ?️\nWe've continued with work on improvements to the user interface, including an\nimprovement to the rate system and how coin prices are fetched. The upcoming\nupdate will also contain a full redesign of the new offer page, a redesign of\nthe current \"swaps in progress\" page, a new index page, as well as the inclusion\nof better defined \"terms and conditions\" (taken from BasicSwap's website here\n[https://basicswapdex.com/terms]) that the users will have to accept after\nsetting up BasicSwap for the first time. \n\nAdditionally, we're working on a series of general changes and improvements to\nthe codebase, such as a more distributed API key management system.\n\nThese updates will soon be available on GitHub and, as always, you'll be able to\ntest these changes before they go live by switching to the dev branch.\n\nIntegration Layer ?\nSince coming back from the 2024 Litecoin Summit, we've started designing the\nintegration layer that will make it possible to integrate swap capabilities into\nthird-party applications or on the web.\n\nWhile actual coding hasn't officially started, we expect to begin within a few\ndays as we iron out the last few details. This item is the next major milestone\nfor BasicSwap and will dramatically improve its user experience by making it\nmore intuitive and easy to use via leverage of third-party applications such as\nalready-established crypto wallets or fully integrated web platforms.\n\nAs always, we're designing this integration layer in such a way that will\npreserve decentralization and privacy as much as possible, as per the usual\nethos that comes with BasicSwap and Particl. \n\nAdditionally, working on this integration layer will carry the additional\nbenefit of completing several milestones identified in community contributor\nOfrnxmr's proposal here\n[https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/ccs-proposals/-/merge_requests/457].\n\nParticl and BasicSwap Media ?\nPrivacy Roundtable ?️\nDon't miss our upcoming Privacy Roundtable on X Spaces with our friend from PIVX\nand Firo this coming 5th of August at 9:00 AM EST as we discuss Zcash funding\noperations and improvements, among other topics!\n\nx.comX (formerly Twitter) [https://x.com/_PIVX/status/1819360462598795374]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

Currently, we have two developers assigned\nto the task: one focusing on the LLM component and the other on\nmarketplace-related adjustments.\n\nWe understand that the community has questions about the system's design and\nwhether it will maintain the marketplace's decentralized and private ethos.\nWhile we plan to release an in-depth blog post explaining all details before the\nsystem's launch, we'd like to provide some additional information now.\n\nDecentralized Marketplace Moderation v0.2\nIt's important to understand that the current system will remain in place. Even\nwith upcoming changes, it will still be possible to manually upvote and downvote\nlistings directly in the application.\n\nWhen first released, this system was announced as v0.1, with future iterations\nplanned. Effective moderation of a decentralized system without third-party bias\nis challenging, and what we're working on is essentially v0.2 of that system.\n\nThis new version will use the same downvote/upvote mechanism where listings are\nremoved from the marketplace's interface once they reach a negative threshold,\nbut with more automation, resulting in a much improved user experience.\n\nPro-Active Moderation\nThe updated system will run on staking nodes, and the Partyman cold staking\napplication will likely include a script to guide users through enabling the\nsystem, setting moderation policies and rules, and consulting moderation\nhistory.\n\nWhen enabled, the system will scan the marketplace and extract individual\nlisting titles and descriptions, which will be processed through a decentralized\nLLM network to test against the user's moderation policies.\n\nThis improved version will ensure more effective and proactive marketplace\nmoderation while reducing reliance on manual user interaction.\n\nFrom an end-user perspective, more effective, automated content moderation will\nreduce encounters with undesirable listings before delisting them, benefiting\nmarketplace adoption and directly addressing a theoretical attack vector.\n\nAbsolute Decentralization\nWe've noted concerns about the new system's level of decentralization and\nwhether users will need to create accounts with AI service providers or run\nresource-intensive open-source models locally.\n\nRest assured, our innovative solution requires neither accounts nor local LLM\ninstances. It utilizes a decentralized network of voluntary GPUs collectively\nrunning Llama-based models. Staking nodes will simply send messages to this\ndecentralized LLM network and receive appropriate responses, which will then be\nprocessed by the rest of the moderation system.\n\nIn other words, decentralization and privacy remain intact, with no compromises\ncaused by the new changes.\n\nUpvoting and Downvoting\nOnce a response is received from the LLM network, the node will use the\nassociated wallet's staking weight to upvote, downvote, or ignore the listing.\nThe marketplace will tally votes for each listing, and if the negative threshold\nis reached, it will be removed, as per the current system.\n\nListings can also be upvoted to counterbalance downvotes, and the delisting\nthreshold will be adjusted to account for the expected increased participation\nrate.\n\nUpcoming Blog Post\nWe'll publish a detailed blog post shortly before releasing this new version of\nthe moderation system, including diagrams, in-depth information, and usage\nguides.\n\nWe're confident this new system will improve the user experience by reducing the\nmoderation burden on end users while also improving efficiency.\n\nDisabling of Public Markets and Storefronts\nWe've also noticed concerns regarding a specific commit made in June to Particl\nMarketplace that would disable public markets and storefronts.\n\nThis commit was initially pushed as a proactive measure to prevent potential\nabuse of Particl Marketplace in case we couldn't rapidly improve the moderation\nsystem.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this commit has not yet been included in\nany release and, given our satisfactory progress on the new version of the\nmoderation system, it now appears that implementing it will not be necessary.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core.

We're confident this new system will significantly improve\nthe current moderation process, improving both its effectiveness but also the\ngeneral user experience.\n\nBefore the new moderation system is fully implemented, you can expect a Particl\nDesktop update featuring the necessary preparatory changes to drop.

That\nmeans you can now swap Decred with all available cryptocurrencies on BasicSwap,\nwhich coincidently marks the completion of its integration within the DEX.\n\nWe'd like to extend our thanks to the Decred community for supporting BasicSwap\ndevelopers with the integration. ?\n\n> Note: We will publish, next week on the Particl News blog, a detailed article\nthat officially announces the completion of the integration as well as in-depth\ninformation about it.\nWownero Integration ? ?️\nThis update also introduces Wownero on the master branch. Similarly to Monero,\nWownero cannot be swapped using regular HTLC (Secret Hash) based swaps, but can\nbe swapped using adaptor signature swaps.\n\nJust like Decred, this update marks the completion of the Wownero integration\ninto BasicSwap. As such, we'd like to extend our thanks to Ofrnxmr for\ncompleting the vast majority of the work that has gone into making this\npossible! ?\n\n> Note: We will publish, next week on the Particl News blog, a detailed article\nthat officially announces the completion of the integration as well as in-depth\ninformation about it.\nParticl and BasicSwap Media ?\nBasicSwap DEX at Monerokon 2024Watch this year’s BasicSwap talk at Monerokon\n2024.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-dex-at-monerokon-2024/]One of BasicSwap's\npresentation at this year's edition of Monerokon has been published by the\norganizers of the conference on their Youtube channel.\n\nSo if you've missed the talk as it was streamed live, or if you want to watch it\nonce more, you can now do so by following the link above or using the embedded\nmedia player below.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Marketplace Update ?\nWe have continued, this week, a full in-depth review of the current design of\nParticl Marketplace, to determine its viability within the current context and\nwhether design changes need to be brought to it.\n\nWith this in mind, we will be carrying all considerations made here into the\ndesign of the new marketplace (tentatively being referred to as \"Particl\nMarketplace V2\"), which is being designed as a more open-ended, accessible, and\nuser-friendly iteration. \n\nAs such, we are deferring work on marketplace features as well as the TAILS and\nTor deliverables until after we complete our reassessment.\n\nParticl Desktop Update ?️\nAs we're progressing through the wallet-related improvements planned for Particl\nDesktop, we've pushed, earlier this week, a new Particl Core update to the\ndesktop client.\n\nTo run the new Core version, simply launch Particl Desktop, or restart it if\nit's already running, and the update will automatically start.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by

regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nWe've been working through a series of back-end and general improvements to the\nBasicSwap DEX codebase, some of which having been completed throughout the week,\nas defined in the list below.\n\n☑️ Update Litecoin Core to 0.21.3\n☑️ Fix LTC trying to use MWEB outputs for proof of funds\n☑️ Fix offer rate + get updating send amount\n? Remove protobuf and encode/decode the binary format directly\n? Allow setting wallet file name for multi-wallet coins\n? Work around LTC MWEB spends not detected after import\n\nDecred Integration ✅\nWe're still working on integrating Decred into BasicSwap and have made progress\nthis week. Here is the relevant progress report in regards to that specific\ndeliverable:\n\n☑️ Collect Decred chain parameters\n☑️ Encode and decode Decred addresses\n☑️ Call Decred RPC commands\n☑️ Start and manage DCR daemon from BasicSwap\n☑️ Start and manage DCR wallet from BasicSwap\n☑️ Validate Decred seed and wallet restoration\n☑️ Add extkey class to get from seed to account pubkey\n☑️ Add CTransaction class\n☑️ Sign Decred transactions\n☑️ Compute Decred sighash\n☑️ Build CSV tests\n☑️ Build watch-only tests\n☑️ Build gettxout, getProofOfFunds, verifyProofOfFunds tests\n? Add Decred to basicswap-prepare setup script\n? Start Decred wallet with full functionality into DEX\n? Add a series of Decred tests\n\nWownero Integration ✅\nThe Wownero integration is nearly ready and can be tested by switching to the \nwownero_full branch on Github, although there may still be issues with it.\n\nThe next step is for the BasicSwap team to review the integration and run a few\ntests before merging. Although we are currently busy working through the Decred\nintegration, we will try to find some time for this shortly. \n\n☑️ Collect Wownero chain parameters\n☑️ Enable encode and decode of 2 byte address prefixes\n☑️ Call WOW RPC commands\n☑️ Start and manage WOW daemon from BasicSwap\n☑️ Start and manage WOW wallet from BasicSwap\n☑️ Validate WOW seed and wallet restoration\n☑️ Add price fetching from CoinGecko\n☑️ Add WOW to basicswap-prepare setup script\n☑️ Start WOW wallet with full functionality into DEX\n?
