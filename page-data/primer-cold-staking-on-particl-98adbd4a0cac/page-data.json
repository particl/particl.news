In Particl your public key isn’t (initially) made public. While you share\nyour Particl address with others so that they can send you coins, your Particl\naddress is only a hash of your public key, not the public key itself.\n\n> A hash function is a one-way cryptographic function that takes an input and\nturns it into a cryptographic output. By one-way I mean that you can’t derive\nthe input from the output. It’s kind of like encrypting something then losing\nthe key.\nWhat does that mean in English?\nAll of that is a complicated way of saying that while an attacker with a quantum\ncomputer could derive the private key from the public key, they couldn’t derive\nthe public key from the Particl address since the public key was run through\nmultiple quantum-resistant one-way hash functions.\n\n— Classic!So how does this all fit together?\nThe cold staking feature consists of several key components:\n\n * your “staking node” (running a new wallet)\n * your “wallet” with your coins (much like today) and\n * a “cold staking script” — this is like the script in bitcoin or smart\n   contracts on other alts\n\nOnce activated your staking node signs transactions with its private key, thus\nyour real public key for your actual PART tokens is never exposed onto the\nblockchain, until you actually spend them, in which case the change always goes\ninto a new address where the public key is not known.\n\nCold Staking In Action\nAgain, cold staking consists of the following components — your staking node,\nyour wallet and a cold staking script.\n\nWhat is the cold staking script?\n\nIt is essentially a smart contract that says `if this is a cold staking\ntransaction, then allow the private key from the staking node to sign the\ntransaction; otherwise the private key from the wallet is required.`\n\nLet’s walk through the process of setting cold staking up\n1First step is to setup a new “staking node”. A staking node is a full\nblockchain node which has been configured to stake on behalf of your “wallet”\n(aka it has been delegated staking power over your wallet). This can be a\ndedicated server, cloud or virtual server, Raspberry Pi3+ or Rock64 etc.\n\n> It is important to note that CPU does matter when staking, so do not expect to\nget the same results from a earlier Pi vs the new generation Pi3s etc.\nOnce the node is setup and in sync, go ahead and create a new wallet, then\ngenerate a staking node public key (keep a note of this as you will need it in\nthe next step).\n\n**We have prepared tools which will automate all these steps for you. These will\nbe made available after the hardfork has happened and the Particl blockchain is\ndeemed secure.**\n\n2Now, lets go back to your “wallet” on your desktop and click on “Activate Cold\nStaking”. You will be prompted for the staking node public key (from step 1).\nEnter this and click activate.\n\nSo what exactly did we just do?\nFirst, you have created a cold staking script config which includes the public\nkey for the staking node to whom you have delegated staking powers to.\n\nSecond, you have instructed your client that the next time it creates a block\nfrom staking (leave the current wallet running until the cold staking progress\nbar shows 100%), it should send the outputs back to itself (just like PoS\ncurrently does) but these outputs will be part of the cold staking script.\n\nThird, the next time you spend any Particl from your wallet the client will also\nautomatically include the cold staking script— from thereon. Once the Cold\nStaking progress bar reaches 100% activation your wallet can remain offline and\nthe staking node you setup in Step 1 will now stake securely for you without\nrisking any of the PART in your wallet.\n\nIt is important to understand that along with this new “coin staking script”\nsmart contract, we have also introduced an important consensus rule that applies\nto cold staking:\n\n> if this is a cold staking transaction then output value must go back to the same\naddress with the same minimum value as the input\nIn short, what this means is “If I staked 1,000 PART from my\nPar7ZFotVucq9EyXN6wRNGFwiZGHVN8Xq7 address then 1,000 PART must go back to the\nsame address” for this to be considered a valid cold staking transaction.\n\nThis is important as it ensures that the staking node only has power to stake\nyour coins and not spend them.\n\nIt is also worth noting here that any value greater than the input value, aka\nthe reward for staking + block fees, are manageable by the staking node. So in\ntheory you could — as part of cold staking — send your staked coins back to your\nwallet address (as per consensus) and send the stake reward to a different\naddress.\n\n?Future Applications\nThis flexibility at the protocol consensus level pave the road for several new\nfeatures in the future such as:\n\n * staking pools\n * donating staking rewards to other causes\n * sending staking rewards to exchange to provide liquidity\n\nThe cold staking protocol is agnostic, so that it works with all public balances\n(anon and blind cannot stake) including those protected by multi-signature\naddresses.\n\nIn the future we envision an upgrade to our Particl Copay App that will add Cold\nStaking support. That will allow us to take advantage of the wallet’s excellent\nmulti-signature support and enable a whole host of new security benefits,\nincluding but not limited to:\n\n * cold staking with multi-signature (ie. your “staking node” will stake but to\n   spend funds you will need m-of-n signatures\n * integration with hardware devices (like Ledger or Trezor) for key signing\n   (providing the utmost level of security when combined with multi-signature\n   and cold staking).\n\nBrief statement about tomorrow’s hardfork\nAs the hardfork cometh at midnight, we’re going to let everyone continue to\nupgrade and track the health of the blockchain for around 12–24 hours. We know\neveryone is anxious to build their Cold Staking contract but what is most\nimportant is ensuring the blockchain and all PART are secure.\n\nThe GUI is getting waxed and buffed for tomorrow’s debut and we’re also\npreparing some guides for the GUI so people can walk through setting up your\ncold staking contracts.\n\nThank you\nParticl Team","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Primer--Cold-Staking-on-Particl/0-HrZMzdYyRd0LIyut.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h2 id=\"quantum-computer-resistant\">Quantum Computer Resistant</h2><p><strong>How? </strong>In Particl your public key isn’t (initially) made public.

Particl Foundation has been using Particl Copay to manage its affairs\nfor both BTC and PART since inception in July. Available on Google Play\n[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.particl.copay] and our Particl\nGithub repository [https://github.com/particl/copay/releases].\n\nQ3 2017 | Particl Electron Wallet App—News Update\n[https://particl.news/built-on-electron-we-proudly-introduce-particl-wallet-v0-1-0-4f312c3df41f]\n\nThe first official builds for this product were for testnet only. However,\neveryone has been free to compile this wallet for mainnet since its release in\nSeptember. The Particl team will be releasing their first official builds of our\nGUI release for mainnet this week. The past 5 weeks have been all hands on deck\nto ensure we have a beautiful, smooth wallet ready for Cold Staking.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nClosing Out\nQ4 2017 | Cold Staking—News Update\n[https://particl.news/alert-particl-hardfork-nov-10th-4ca5b994017c]\n\nThis Friday, Cold Staking will be activated on mainnet meaning it has graduated\nfrom the testing environment (testnet) into the arms of every user working on\nthe network!\n\nDon’t be left behind! You may be one of the nodes still running old protocol.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNew Additions\nQ4 2017 | Atomic Swaps\n\nThis quarter the PART blockchain will realize it’s not alone in this world! The\ngreat guys at Decred Project tested and approved the PR a couple weeks ago. Keep\na lookout for promotion of DCR/PART atomic swaps. We will continue to test and\ncollaborate cross chain transactions with other projects. This is a big part of\nour vision for the cryptoagnostic Marketplace\n[http://www.investopedia.com/news/how-cryptocurrency-agnosticism-could-impact-industry/]\n.\n\nAdd Particl Support by dasource · Pull Request #29 · decred/atomicswap\n[https://github.com/decred/atomicswap/pull/29]\nThis implements the partatomicswap command.

Above, we shared the new team\nmembers that are coming on to help us reach these goals.\n\nThis week also closes the last critical path item (cold staking) for public\nrelease so the team can focus 100% on the Privacy Marketplace. Case in point, a\nnew huge initial commit on paid SMSG code posted earlier today!\n\nInitial paid smsg code. · particl/particl-core@4596cf3\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commit/4596cf3139ac274df048197503857f85187ea0f0]\nNew -smsgsaddnewkeys option restores the old behaviour of searching for\nmessages\non all new keys Moved stake and…\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commit/4596cf3139ac274df048197503857f85187ea0f0]\ngithub.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commit/4596cf3139ac274df048197503857f85187ea0f0]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore 3rd-Party Integrations\nBeginning next week the Dev Team will be back full strength on the Marketplace\napplication. We are always in conversations with people with projects that will\nadd value to Particl. A big piece of the framework that makes up the Particl\nPlatform is having spending/trading/commerce flexibility between\ncryptocurrencies and off platform.\n\nWe’ve shared on Twitter our GUI integrations of some of the popular exchanges\nwe’ve built relationships with — Changelly and Shapeshift among others. These\nintegrations don’t require full-team input, typically just our Lead Core\nDeveloper Tecnovert’s expertise.\n\n> \nAs the opportunity presents itself we will push for valuable integrations that\nwill benefit the Particl Framework and our users. One to keep a lookout for is\nwith the team at Ledger.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResearch Grant\nOne of our token exchange milestones was to create a research grant with a major\nuniversity.\n\nGiven the resources and focus an education institution can bring to a privacy\nproject like Particl, we saw this as a way to leverage research students and\nfaculty towards decentralized marketplace economics.\n\nThe Foundation began November with a $35,000 donation to the New Jersey\nInstitute of Technology that gives us a focused team of students\n[https://web.njit.edu/~qiang/#student] and faculty lead by Assistant Professor \nQiang Tang [http://cs.njit.edu/people/qiang-tang].\n\nHis team will spend 6 months combing over privacy enhancements Particl has added\non top of Bitcoin such as Ring Signature Confidential Transactions (RingCT) and\nfocused research surrounding decentralized marketplaces, privacy and user\nacquisition/localization strategies.\n\nProfessor Tang’s research interests lie in applied & theoretical cryptography,\nprivacy and computer security. In particular: blockchain technology,\npost-Snowden cryptography, accountability, and information theoretic security.\n\nWhen looking for a qualified group of academics to focus on privacy on Particl’s\nblockchain we were very impressed by Qiang’s own research — which we encourage\nanyone to take the time to read through some of his papers and publications.\n\nQiang Tang [https://web.njit.edu/~qiang/#paper]\n2017.10.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
