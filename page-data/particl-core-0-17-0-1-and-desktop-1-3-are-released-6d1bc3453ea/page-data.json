Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\nLast week’s livestream was a special edition as we had the great pleasure to\nwelcome Gerlof van Ek, Particl’s Lead Designer, on the livestream as a guest.\n\nGerlof, more commonly known as Crz within the community, has gained valuable\nexperience working for international companies like Disney, Yves Rocher and\nother major design companies. He’s made a name for himself working and\nfreelancing for various successful crypto and blockchain projects such as \nShadowcash, which he co-founded with Ryno and Tecnovert. He has also had a hand\nin EOS (logo/branding), Nexus, CryptoFR [https://cryptofr.com/], BitcoinFR\n[https://bitcoin.fr/], Blocktix, a few exchanges and — of course —Particl, to\nname a few.\n\nGerlof works full-time on Particl, a project he has absolute passion for, and is\nin charge of the branding, GUI design, and much more. For more details about\nGerlof’s journey, watch him break it down on last week’s livestream starting at \n2:10 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=2m10s]!\n\n(10:10 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=10m10s]) Could you please elaborate a bit\non the Bitcoin DDoS bug that was disclosed? How is it possible Particl isn’t\naffected since it’s built on the Bitcoin codebase?\nThe Bitcoin DDoS bug that was recently disclosed about Bitcoin was actually\npretty critical\n[https://medium.com/@jimmysong/bitcoin-core-bug-cve-2018-17144-an-analysis-f80d9d373362]\n, some people even speculating it may have been one of the largest, if not the\nlargest, exploit ever found on Bitcoin. This exploit was inadvertently\nintroduced in Bitcoin Core 0.14 and has been present in all further versions,\nmeaning projects with older versions of the Bitcoin codebase weren’t affected by\nit (for example, PIVX).\n\nAs for Particl, our codebase is always on the heels of Bitcoin Core and is\nsimply not a copy-paste version Bitcoin at some past point in time. Indeed, our\ncore development team is super diligent and focused on security, and this\nvulnerability was spotted long ago by them as they built Particl Confidential\nTransactions on Bitcoin 14.2. In fact, this issue was fixed by our team even\nbefore we went live with our genesis block, meaning Particl has never been\naffected by it at any moment of its history. When we say that security is one of\nour core value, we really mean it, and we have the developers to live up to this\nclaim!.\n\n(13:48 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=13m48s]) Has the Particl UI been designed\nin such a way that will make it easy to apply skins to it?\nYes. Particl Desktop is 100% open-source and users can code their own themes\nusing HTML and CSS. Particl itself is planning on introducing two default themes\n, a light one, which is the current one, and a dark one, for those using Particl\nDesktop at night. We have had an idea where users could go to their Settings\npage and set up their client to automatically change the theme at a specific\ntime of the day, as chosen by the user itself. Additional themes can be coded by\nthe community and might make it to the official repo if they are popular or\nparticularly appreciated by the team.\n\n(15:44 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=15m44s]) Gerlof, it’s been said that\nyou’ve helped other crypto teams with their graphics and branding (such as EOS),\nso with that in mind, what made you choose to join Particl as a team member as\nopposed to any of the other teams you’ve worked with?\nParaphrased: Particl really is my passion and what I consider to be my main\nproject. I absolutely enjoy working on it and taking what was once simply an\nidea to what it is now. I keep wanting to improve it, make it better, and see\nhow far it can go. Another reason I made Particl my full-time project is that we\nhave a super great team composed of genuinely great AND really talented\nindividuals. The atmosphere “behind the scenes” is super positive and\nmotivating, which makes for a great work environment.\n\n(17:39 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=17m39s]) When you first started working\nwith Ryno, was it just the two of you or was Tecnovert, or any other developer,\npart of the initial team?\nParaphrased: We were basically like the three musketeers. We had members come\nand go throughout this journey but us three were basically the core team. The\nvision and scope of the project has severely evolved since we started working on\nit and we found new core members along the way which are now important\ncomponents of Particl. The team has pretty much become a well-oiled machine now\nwith around 15 developers actively working on the project and it is amazing to\nsee!\n\nEverything is carefully planned, and we have daily meetings (sometimes more than\none per day), and the entire project has evolved from a hobby project to a\nreally professional one. Ludx is one great example of a super top quality team\nmember we’ve picked along the way and he’s now working full-time and around the\nclock on Particl, leading the marketplace side of things as well as a lot of the\nbackend stuff. He’s really passionate about Particl and definitely helps taking\nParticl to the next level!\n\n(20:31 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=20m31s]) Will Particl Desktop’s page\neventually default to the marketplace for the sake of usability and mainstream\npotential?\nYes and no… Right now, the wallet is what you see first when you launch Particl\nDesktop, but we do want to redesign/rebuild the Overview page to change it to a\nmore customizable one with the help of Particl widgets. That is because buyers\nand vendors will probably not want to see the same thing when they launch\nParticl Desktop. A vendor might be interested in quickly overviewing their sales\ndata, orders, or inventory whereas a buyer might be more interested in their\npurchasing history or favored items.\n\nSimilarly to regular eCommerce websites, it would be more familiar to shoppers\nif the first thing they see when loading up Particl is a search bar where they\ncan immediately start looking for what they want. Of course, both types of users\nmight be interested in the same data as well such as messages, shipping statues\non ongoing transactions, and so on. This would make the Overview page of Particl\nDesktop a true dashboard.\n\nBecause every user has different needs and expectations, we want Particl Desktop\nto be very customizable. One of the way we aim to attain that customization is\nto have a complete installer that launches the first time you launch the client.\nThis installer will allow users to choose what decentralized applications they\nwant to be included in their personal version of Particl Desktop as well as set\ntheir client up with various parameters and setting options. For example, a user\nmight be only interested in the passive income aspect of Particl, therefore she\ncould disable the marketplace altogether to make the client more lightweight in\nterms of resources. This will be up to the users themselves to choose and design\ntheir most optimal Particl Desktop setup.\n\n> It’s important to understand that Particl is still pretty much in a heavy\ndevelopment phase and mostly a testing environment for now.\nThese are all options we’ve been heavily considering but as with everything\nbeing built alongside blockchain technology, it takes time to develop and\neverything has to be included in a priority queue. We highly recommend users to\ntest the various iterations of Particl Marketplace and Particl Desktop and give\nus as many feedback as possible, either by writing about it in our #testing\n[https://discord.gg/m27aqEq] or #Open-Development [https://discord.gg/7SjzX7Q] \nchannels or directly on the Issues section of Particl Desktop on Github\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues]. It’s important to try\ndifferent approaches at this stage of development and see what works best and\nwhat doesn’t.\n\nParticl-Desktop — Issues [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues]\nParticl Angular GUI — The source for the Particl GUI. — particl/particl-desktop\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues]\n\n(24:59 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDCzPdVHMJY&feature=youtu.be&t=24m59s])\nIs Particl making plans to have more sponsored ambassadors, per country?\nYes. We’ve had some community members step up already. As a prime example,\nJoaquimF, a Particl fan from Brazil, has been working with us for the past 2 or\n3 weeks to organize a local meetup in Saō Paulo, Brazil. We provided him with a\nton of information as well as some PART coins for the attendees to play with on\nParticl Copay. Additionally, we’ve created flyers both in english and portuguese\nfor the people that are going to be present as well as some custom and exclusive\nt-shirts. Brazil is big on marketplaces in general and we do see this country as\na good place where Particl Marketplace could shine, so with that in mind, we’d\nlike to take this opportunity to thank JoaquimF for his implication and\ngo-getter attitude as well as the effort put in in organizing this these past\nfew weeks!\n\nParticl Meetup in São Paulo, Brazil | Dunas\n[https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde]\nFriday, October 5, 2018\n[https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde]\n\nWe also had motivated folks from the United States, France, Switzerland, and UK\npointing out to us their interest in contributing in a more pro-active way. Note\nthat we will always support and give resources to motivated individuals with a\ndesire to spread the Particl word in the “real world”. We highly encourage\nanyone that wants to step up or have ideas on how to spread the word to contact\nus, either through Paul Schmitzer, Cryptoguard, or any other team member. We’ve\nalso started to take a deeper look into potential conferences, and while it may\nbe hard for us sometimes to make it to these conferences due to the fact that we\nare still in that heavy development phase, we will always consider great\nopportunities. Going to conferences will be something we’ll increasingly be\nlooking for the closer we near to the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace and\nbeyond.\n\n(44:03 [https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=44m3s]) Is there a limit to the number of\nlistings Particl Marketplace can support?\nNo! There is no upper limit to how many items Particl Marketplace can support!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nNew Particl Core and Particl Desktop Versions Released\nParticl Core 0.17.0.1 and Desktop 1.3 are released\n[https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-1-and-desktop-1-3-are-released-6d1bc3453ea]\nToday, Particl Core 0.17.0.1 was released on the heels of Bitcoin Core 0.17.0\nreleased yesterday.\n[https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-1-and-desktop-1-3-are-released-6d1bc3453ea]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-core-0-17-0-1-and-desktop-1-3-are-released-6d1bc3453ea]\n\nWe’ve released yesterday two major updates to our clients: Particl Desktop 1.3,\nand Particl Core 0.17.0.1. Both these updates are important, especially for\nParticl Desktop to connect securely to 0.17. This update marks a departure in\nour usual methodology of keeping up-to-date with the Bitcoin codebase a few days\nor weeks after Bitcoin updates its core protocol. This time, we’ve gone ahead a\nreleased it ahead of time.\n\nMost of the changes from Desktop v1.2.3 to v1.3 are cosmetic or bug/issue\nrelated. Most importantly — just like the previous version — users of Desktop\nv1.3 will see an upgrade to the latest Particl Core (0.17.0.1) automatically on\nrestart.\n\n> It is highly recommended for users running Desktop v1.2.2 or earlier to\nimmediately upgrade to Desktop 1.3 in order to be securely communicating with\nCore 0.17.0.1.\nNote: If you have cold staking activated, you will need to update your partyman\napp by navigating to its folder and executing the “git pull” command (without\nthe “ ”). You might also be requested to update your Core node by executing the\n“./partyman update” command (again, without the “ ”).\n\nNew Status Report Out\nParticl.io — StatusReport [https://www.particl.io/status-report]\nParticl provides a decentralized privacy platform with a suite of tools to\nenhance your online privacy * Private… [https://www.particl.io/status-report]\nwww.particl.io [https://www.particl.io/status-report]\n\nAs is now tradition, a new Status Report has been released last Friday just\nbefore we’ve started streaming. While not entirely different from previous\nreports, there are still a few interesting developments worth pointing out. For\none, the report shows that the escrow refactoring and enhancement process has\nbeen completed.\n\nA one week old preview of the current Particl’s testnet environmentThe report\nalso shows the team has started adding coin weight to the governance mechanism,\nmeaning that soon enough, it will work on a 1 coin = 1 vote basis. Implementing\nthe coin weight is a necessary feature of the governance mechanism to help\nfights spammers and only let users with an actual stake in the platform govern\nit. Coin weight also allows anyone, staker or not, to participate in the\ndemocratic process. For an interesting discussion regarding coin weight, visit\nthis forum thread of an archived discussion some community members and Lead\nParticl Marketplace Developer Ludx had last week on Discord/Telegram:\n\nDebate on Decentralized Voting Methodology Optimization\n[https://particl.community/t/debate-on-decentralized-voting-methodology-optimization/306]\nARCHIVED] General Discussion Channel (Discord/Telegram) (28–09–2018) Link:\nhttps://discord.gg/uvSpbQN Lollr: You can’t…\n[https://particl.community/t/debate-on-decentralized-voting-methodology-optimization/306]\nparticl.community\n[https://particl.community/t/debate-on-decentralized-voting-methodology-optimization/306]\n\nAdditionally, following some requests from the community on Telegram, we’ve\nbegun working on a Support & Help tab which will guide and help new users,\nespecially those not very experienced with crypto, in using Particl Desktop.\nThis is directly in line with our mission to make the Particl platform as easy\nto use as possible, even for non-techy individuals. Another item we’ve started\nworking on is a small tweak to the Community Proposals system to make its\nlifecycle based on a time measure rather than a block measure.\n\nAs usual, Particl is still under heavy development and there are a lot of code\nbeing refactored to make it more efficient as well as making the experience\nsmoother and more user-friendly. To get more details about the development\nprogress, please refer to our Status Report [http://particl.io/status-report].\n\nNoteworthy Github Activity\nAside from the Status Report, Github [http://github.com/particl] is always the\nbest place to keep yourself up-to-date with all the latest developments.

Once again, we’ve had a very high participation rate with around 90\nsubmissions from 18 different users. As suggested by some community members,\nwe’ve decided to change the rules a little bit and have a jury composed of team\nmembers handpick the best slogans and put them up for vote. This should reduce\n“user fatigue” when confronted with too many options, and hopefully will result\nin a higher voting participation rate.\n\nThe contest ends next Monday, so if you had a slogan in mind and haven’t posted\nit yet, now is the time to do it!\n\nNew Video & Article from CryptoRamble\nThe Startling Secret Between Google and MasterCard — Crypto Ramble — Medium\n[https://medium.com/@cryptoramble/14eb3cfbc172]\nImagine that you are the creator of a useful tool that you think will help\nsociety.

When we say that security is one of our core value, we really mean it, and we have the developers to live up to this claim!.</p><h3 id=\"-13-48-has-the-particl-ui-been-designed-in-such-a-way-that-will-make-it-easy-to-apply-skins-to-it\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=13m48s\">13:48</a>) Has the Particl UI been designed in such a way that will make it easy to apply skins to it?</h3><p>Yes. Particl Desktop is 100% open-source and users can code their own themes using HTML and CSS. Particl itself is planning on introducing <strong>two default themes</strong>, a light one, which is the current one, and a dark one, for those using Particl Desktop at night. We have had an idea where users could go to their Settings page and set up their client to <strong>automatically change the theme at a specific time of the day</strong>, as chosen by the user itself. Additional themes can be coded by the community and might make it to the official repo if they are popular or particularly appreciated by the team.</p><h3 id=\"-15-44-gerlof-it-s-been-said-that-you-ve-helped-other-crypto-teams-with-their-graphics-and-branding-such-as-eos-so-with-that-in-mind-what-made-you-choose-to-join-particl-as-a-team-member-as-opposed-to-any-of-the-other-teams-you-ve-worked-with\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=15m44s\">15:44</a>) Gerlof, it’s been said that you’ve helped other crypto teams with their graphics and branding (such as EOS), so with that in mind, what made you choose to join Particl as a team member as opposed to any of the other teams you’ve worked with?</h3><p><strong>Paraphrased:</strong> <em>Particl really is my passion and what I consider to be my main project. I absolutely enjoy working on it and taking what was once simply an idea to what it is now. I keep wanting to improve it, make it better, and see how far it can go. Another reason I made Particl my full-time project is that we have a super great team composed of genuinely great AND really talented individuals. The atmosphere “behind the scenes” is super positive and motivating, which makes for a great work environment.</em></p><h3 id=\"-17-39-when-you-first-started-working-with-ryno-was-it-just-the-two-of-you-or-was-tecnovert-or-any-other-developer-part-of-the-initial-team\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=17m39s\">17:39</a>) When you first started working with Ryno, was it just the two of you or was Tecnovert, or any other developer, part of the initial team?</h3><p><strong>Paraphrased: </strong><em>We were basically like the three musketeers. We had members come and go throughout this journey but us three were basically the core team. The vision and scope of the project has severely evolved since we started working on it and we found new core members along the way which are now important components of Particl. The team has pretty much become a well-oiled machine now with around </em><em><strong>15 developers</strong></em><em> actively working on the project and it is amazing to see!</em></p><p><em>Everything is carefully planned, and we have </em><em><strong>daily meetings</strong></em><em> (sometimes more than one per day), and the entire project has evolved from a hobby project to a really professional one.

That is because buyers and vendors will probably not want to see the same thing when they launch Particl Desktop. A vendor might be interested in quickly overviewing their sales data, orders, or inventory whereas a buyer might be more interested in their purchasing history or favored items.</p><p>Similarly to regular eCommerce websites, it would be more familiar to shoppers if the first thing they see when loading up Particl is a search bar where they can immediately start looking for what they want. Of course, both types of users might be interested in the same data as well such as messages, shipping statues on ongoing transactions, and so on. This would make the Overview page of Particl Desktop a true dashboard.</p><p>Because every user has different needs and expectations, we want Particl Desktop to be <strong>very customizable</strong>. One of the way we aim to attain that customization is to have a complete <strong>installer</strong> that launches the first time you launch the client. This installer will allow users to <strong>choose what decentralized applications they want to be included</strong> in their personal version of Particl Desktop as well as set their client up with various parameters and setting options. For example, a user might be only interested in the passive income aspect of Particl, therefore she could disable the marketplace altogether to make the client more lightweight in terms of resources. <strong>This will be up to the users themselves to choose and design their most optimal Particl Desktop setup</strong>.</p><blockquote>It’s important to understand that Particl is still pretty much in a heavy development phase and mostly a testing environment for now.</blockquote><p>These are all options we’ve been heavily considering but as with everything being built alongside blockchain technology, it takes time to develop and everything has to be included in a priority queue. We highly recommend users to test the various iterations of Particl Marketplace and Particl Desktop and give us as many feedback as possible, either by writing about it in our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/m27aqEq\"><strong>#testing</strong></a> or <a href=\"https://discord.gg/7SjzX7Q\"><strong>#Open-Development</strong></a> channels or directly on the <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\"><strong>Issues section of Particl Desktop on Github</strong></a>.

We’ve had some community members step up already. As a prime example, JoaquimF, a Particl fan from Brazil, has been working with us for the past 2 or 3 weeks to organize a local meetup in Saō Paulo, Brazil. We provided him with a ton of information as well as some PART coins for the attendees to play with on Particl Copay. Additionally, we’ve created flyers both in english and portuguese for the people that are going to be present as well as some custom and exclusive t-shirts. Brazil is big on marketplaces in general and we do see this country as a good place where Particl Marketplace could shine, so with that in mind, we’d like to take this opportunity to thank JoaquimF for his implication and go-getter attitude as well as the effort put in in organizing this these past few weeks!</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\"><strong>Particl Meetup in São Paulo, Brazil | Dunas</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\"><em>Friday, October 5, 2018</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\">particl.news</a></p><p>We also had motivated folks from the United States, France, Switzerland, and UK pointing out to us their interest in contributing in a more pro-active way. Note that we will always support and give resources to motivated individuals with a desire to spread the Particl word in the “real world”. We highly encourage anyone that wants to step up or have ideas on how to spread the word to contact us, either through Paul Schmitzer, Cryptoguard, or any other team member. We’ve also started to take a deeper look into potential conferences, and while it may be hard for us sometimes to make it to these conferences due to the fact that we are still in that heavy development phase, we will always consider great opportunities. Going to conferences will be something we’ll increasingly be looking for the closer we near to the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace and beyond.</p><h3 id=\"-44-03-is-there-a-limit-to-the-number-of-listings-particl-marketplace-can-support\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=44m3s\">44:03</a>) Is there a limit to the number of listings Particl Marketplace can support?</h3><p>No!

Both these updates are important, especially for Particl Desktop to connect securely to 0.17. This update marks a departure in our usual methodology of keeping up-to-date with the Bitcoin codebase a few days or weeks after Bitcoin updates its core protocol. This time, we’ve gone ahead a released it ahead of time.</p><p>Most of the changes from Desktop v1.2.3 to v1.3 are cosmetic or bug/issue related. Most importantly — just like the previous version — users of Desktop v1.3 will see an upgrade to the latest Particl Core (0.17.0.1) <strong>automatically</strong> on restart.</p><blockquote><strong>It is highly recommended for users running Desktop v1.2.2 or earlier to immediately upgrade to Desktop 1.3 in order to be securely communicating with Core 0.17.0.1.</strong></blockquote><p><em><strong>Note: </strong></em><em>If you have cold staking activated, you will need to update your partyman app by navigating to its folder and executing the “</em><em><strong>git pull</strong></em><em>” command (without the “ ”).

A vendor might be interested in quickly overviewing their sales data, orders, or inventory whereas a buyer might be more interested in their purchasing history or favored items.</p><p>Similarly to regular eCommerce websites, it would be more familiar to shoppers if the first thing they see when loading up Particl is a search bar where they can immediately start looking for what they want. Of course, both types of users might be interested in the same data as well such as messages, shipping statues on ongoing transactions, and so on. This would make the Overview page of Particl Desktop a true dashboard.</p><p>Because every user has different needs and expectations, we want Particl Desktop to be <strong>very customizable</strong>. One of the way we aim to attain that customization is to have a complete <strong>installer</strong> that launches the first time you launch the client. This installer will allow users to <strong>choose what decentralized applications they want to be included</strong> in their personal version of Particl Desktop as well as set their client up with various parameters and setting options. For example, a user might be only interested in the passive income aspect of Particl, therefore she could disable the marketplace altogether to make the client more lightweight in terms of resources. <strong>This will be up to the users themselves to choose and design their most optimal Particl Desktop setup</strong>.</p><blockquote>It’s important to understand that Particl is still pretty much in a heavy development phase and mostly a testing environment for now.</blockquote><p>These are all options we’ve been heavily considering but as with everything being built alongside blockchain technology, it takes time to develop and everything has to be included in a priority queue. We highly recommend users to test the various iterations of Particl Marketplace and Particl Desktop and give us as many feedback as possible, either by writing about it in our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/m27aqEq\"><strong>#testing</strong></a> or <a href=\"https://discord.gg/7SjzX7Q\"><strong>#Open-Development</strong></a> channels or directly on the <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\"><strong>Issues section of Particl Desktop on Github</strong></a>. It’s important to try different approaches at this stage of development and see what works best and what doesn’t.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\"><strong>Particl-Desktop — Issues</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\"><em>Particl Angular GUI — The source for the Particl GUI. — particl/particl-desktop</em></a><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues\">github.com</a></p><h3 id=\"-24-59-is-particl-making-plans-to-have-more-sponsored-ambassadors-per-country\">(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDCzPdVHMJY&#x26;feature=youtu.be&#x26;t=24m59s\">24:59</a>) Is Particl making plans to have more sponsored ambassadors, per country?</h3><p>Yes. We’ve had some community members step up already. As a prime example, JoaquimF, a Particl fan from Brazil, has been working with us for the past 2 or 3 weeks to organize a local meetup in Saō Paulo, Brazil. We provided him with a ton of information as well as some PART coins for the attendees to play with on Particl Copay. Additionally, we’ve created flyers both in english and portuguese for the people that are going to be present as well as some custom and exclusive t-shirts. Brazil is big on marketplaces in general and we do see this country as a good place where Particl Marketplace could shine, so with that in mind, we’d like to take this opportunity to thank JoaquimF for his implication and go-getter attitude as well as the effort put in in organizing this these past few weeks!</p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\"><strong>Particl Meetup in São Paulo, Brazil | Dunas</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\"><em>Friday, October 5, 2018</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-meetup-in-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil-dunas-a7a120ad3dde\">particl.news</a></p><p>We also had motivated folks from the United States, France, Switzerland, and UK pointing out to us their interest in contributing in a more pro-active way. Note that we will always support and give resources to motivated individuals with a desire to spread the Particl word in the “real world”. We highly encourage anyone that wants to step up or have ideas on how to spread the word to contact us, either through Paul Schmitzer, Cryptoguard, or any other team member. We’ve also started to take a deeper look into potential conferences, and while it may be hard for us sometimes to make it to these conferences due to the fact that we are still in that heavy development phase, we will always consider great opportunities. Going to conferences will be something we’ll increasingly be looking for the closer we near to the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace and beyond.</p><h3 id=\"-44-03-is-there-a-limit-to-the-number-of-listings-particl-marketplace-can-support\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDCzPdVHMJY?t=44m3s\">44:03</a>) Is there a limit to the number of listings Particl Marketplace can support?</h3><p>No!

Both these updates are important, especially for Particl Desktop to connect securely to 0.17. This update marks a departure in our usual methodology of keeping up-to-date with the Bitcoin codebase a few days or weeks after Bitcoin updates its core protocol. This time, we’ve gone ahead a released it ahead of time.</p><p>Most of the changes from Desktop v1.2.3 to v1.3 are cosmetic or bug/issue related. Most importantly — just like the previous version — users of Desktop v1.3 will see an upgrade to the latest Particl Core (0.17.0.1) <strong>automatically</strong> on restart.</p><blockquote><strong>It is highly recommended for users running Desktop v1.2.2 or earlier to immediately upgrade to Desktop 1.3 in order to be securely communicating with Core 0.17.0.1.</strong></blockquote><p><em><strong>Note: </strong></em><em>If you have cold staking activated, you will need to update your partyman app by navigating to its folder and executing the “</em><em><strong>git pull</strong></em><em>” command (without the “ ”).

This is directly in line with our mission to make the Particl platform as easy to use as possible, even for non-techy individuals. Another item we’ve started working on is a small tweak to the Community Proposals system to make its lifecycle based on a time measure rather than a block measure.</p><p>As usual, Particl is still under heavy development and there are a lot of code being refactored to make it more efficient as well as making the experience smoother and more user-friendly.

Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nMulti-Net Support ?\nMultinet by tecnovert · Pull Request #311 · basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
