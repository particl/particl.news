They will be\npublished at a regular schedule on the fourth Thursday of every month.\n\nToday marks this first such project update, and it’s one that is particularly\nimportant given the load of information contained in this blog post. So without\nfurther ado, let’s dive right into it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Content\n * Tecnovert Update\n   [https://particl.news/project-update-26-11-2020-2bdaedb3e96b#1e4a]\n * Particl V3 Progress\n   [https://particl.news/project-update-26-11-2020-2bdaedb3e96b#283f]\n * In-app Swap Module\n   [https://particl.news/project-update-26-11-2020-2bdaedb3e96b#5b90]\n * Team Update\n   [https://particl.news/project-update-26-11-2020-2bdaedb3e96b#f0b6]\n * CCS System [https://particl.news/project-update-26-11-2020-2bdaedb3e96b#e32e]\n * Revamped Particl Wiki\n   [https://particl.news/project-update-26-11-2020-2bdaedb3e96b#8b14]\n * What’s Coming\n   [https://particl.news/project-update-26-11-2020-2bdaedb3e96b#770c]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDevelopment Update\nTecnovert & Core Update\nAs you know, most of the current development efforts have been focused on\nbringing to life the long-anticipated Particl V3 release. However, Tecnovert,\nParticl’s lead cryptographer, has been working on other stuff in the meantime.\n\nXMR — PART Atomic Swap\ntecnovert/xmrswap\nImplementation of the h4sh3d Bitcoin-Monero Cross-chain Atomic Swap protocol…\ngithub.com\nNot too long ago, he released the xmrswap protocol\n[http://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap] which allows XMR and PART to be exchanged\nvia atomic swaps. For those who don’t know, atomic swaps are contracts of\nexchange and executed between two users without the assistance of any\nthird-party. They are uncensorable, private, and fully decentralized swaps of\nvalue from one cryptocurrency to the other.\n\nParticl Core 0.21.1.0\nHe has also put a lot of work into updating the current Particl Core version\n(0.19) to the latest Bitcoin version (0.21). Since it has been some time since\nthe latest Core update, it’s taken a significant amount of work to complete but\nit was well worth it due to what’s being introduced by it.\n\nOn Monday the 23rd of November, 2020, Tecnovert has finally pre-released Particl\nCore 0.21.1.0 on mainnet. We highly recommend downloading and installing the new\ncore version and testing it out. That’ll provide valuable feedback to Tecnovert\nwhich he’ll be able to use to finish off the release and push it as a full\nrelease.\n\n * Download: https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.1.0rc1\n\nNote: This release re-introduces 32bit builds which have been requested by some\ncommunity members. If you happen to be one of those, please download and test\nthese in your environment and report back to the #Development channel.\n\nTaproot Readiness\nUpgrading to the newest core version of Particl introduces the required code for\nTaproot to make its way onto Particl.\n\nTaproot is a form of transaction based on “MAST”, but with a little tweak, that\nallows you to make a complicated conditional transaction (i.e. atomic swap) look\nlike a typical transaction. In Particl’s case, this new feature is specially\nintended to increase the privacy level of atomic swaps by having them look like\nany other regular transaction to the outside observer. Check this article from\nCoinDesk [https://www.coindesk.com/taproot-merged-bitcoin-core] for more\ninformation about this new protocol improvement.\n\nBlockBook Integration\nParticl’s invaluable core developer Kewde has recently been working on adding\nsupport for Blockbook, a Trezor-compatible block explorer with some extra\nfeatures. The support should be available within the new few days now, watch for\nany Particl.news [https://particl.news/] blog post about it in the coming days.\n\nParticl Marketplace (V3)\nIn reality, there is very little left to do before the V3 release is ready for\npublic testing.\n\n- The V3 market codebase has recently been pushed on Github and is now available\nfor public audit. The codebase is complete with all V3 additions and refactored\ncode in place. You can follow its progress and check out the changes here: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-market/commits/develop\n\n- During the internal round of testing that’s been going for a couple of weeks\nnow, a bunch of new issues related to the Windows build have popped up and\nrequired developers to allocate extra time to them. They have all been resolved\nas of last week, but please be on the lookout for any Windows-related issues\nwhen testing Particl V3 on Windows.\n\n- It was announced two weeks ago that only notifications and comments needed to\nbe completed before the public release of testnet builds. As of today, it can be\nreported that the notifications have been fully completed and are currently\nbeing tested in recent internal builds.\n\n- Some issues have arisen concerning the buyflow integration of comments\n(buyer/seller communication). As the changes required to fix the problem may\ntake some time, the team is exploring releasing the testnet build without this\nportion of the comment feature for now and integrating it either during public\ntestnet or as a V3.1 release.\n\n- Current builds have been tested quite extensively by now. The public testnet\nis expected to go very smoothly and be short in duration before the release can\nmove up onto the mainnet.\n\nIn-app Swap Module\nParticl’s SMSG bot framework has been significantly improved, but the in-app\nswap module still requires a bit of work for it to be completely finished off.\nAdditionally, some of Particl’s swap partners (SimpleSwap, StealthEX, and\nSwapSpace) have been experiencing issues with the PART pair and are actively\nworking on bringing back up.\n\nThe Particl team and these teams have been in constant communication for a while\nnow. The issue is related to Bittrex which has recently changed the terms of how\nthey want to work with swap businesses using their APIs. The exchanges are\nstating that they are working on solutions to bring PART back up on the\nexchanges, but it may take some time.\n\nFor this reason, the in-app swap module may unfortunately not be part of the\ninitial V3 release and may, instead, be pushed to the 3.1 release or whenever\nPART gets back up on these exchanges. Exactly when this happens is yet to be\ndetermined but is partly dependent on factors external to Particl.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTeam Update\nA few weeks ago and effective at that time, the Particl team and Foundation\nmutually agreed to take proactive measures to ensure the continued development\nof the project while at the same time cutting down the costs to the minimum.\n\nCutting Down on the Costs\nAs a result, all salaried Particl team members have agreed to momentarily not\ntake a salary while at the same time pledging to continue the development of the\nproject and its roadmap.\n\nThis is only possible thanks to the passion of each Particl team member and\ntheir commitment to Particl’s mission of a more fair, free, and secure\nenvironment of eCommerce.\n\nWhat does this change?\nIn reality, this won’t change much in the sense that the roadmap will still be\nworked on as planned earlier this year. It does, however, change how the team\nwill approach tackling the roadmap items needed to complete. Here are a few\nexpected changes as a result of this new reality.\n\n 1. The project will be managed a bit differently in the background with a focus\n    on maximum cost reduction. This includes using different tools, streamlining\n    processes, and refocusing the development strategy of the project. This may\n    not cause a lot of visible changes to the outside environment but will be\n    key to the continued success of the project and the reduction of its costs.\n 2. Some independent initiatives may be pushed by team members, their partners,\n    or outside contractors through the CCS system. The Particl team highly\n    encourages and supports community members making their own proposals.\n 3. Particl team members may independently work with or help different projects\n    which are working on directly expanding Particl’s ecosystem. These may\n    include various independent initiatives, Particl-based applications or\n    businesses, service providers, and etc. Over the past few weeks, there has\n    been a lot brewing in that important regard which has kept some of Particl\n    team members very busy. More details on the topic will be provided at a\n    later date.\n\nImportant Focus on CCS\nThe Particl team has recently released the CCS, a community crowdfunding tool.\nMoving forward, the team may use this system to push independent initiatives or\ncommunity votes. The team strongly recommends the community to also come up with\nits own initiatives to further decentralize the evolution of the Particl\necosystem and stimulate its economy.\n\nIf you have any ideas or proposals, don’t hesitate to reach out to fellow\nParticl community or team members for help. The CCS is the perfect system to\nkickstart Particl’s economy and will prove very useful over time.\n\nRevamped Particl Wiki\nThe Particl Wiki [https://particl.wiki] has recently been significantly improved\nthanks to the incredible work done by Allien, Particl’s UI/UX Lead. It features\na much better navigation/structure and provides a lot of technical documentation\nand guides. The Particl Wiki, which focused on the advanced user, serves as a\ngreat complement to the incoming Particl Academy which will instead focus on the\n“general user” by making all the information as simple to follow and easy to\nunderstand as possible.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Coming\nThere are a lot of really great things coming for Particl. Whereas 2020 has been\na significant development-focused year for Particl, mainly because the great\nmajority of the time has been spent on Particl’s massive V3 update, 2021 should\nfeel more active in terms of outreach and marketing efforts towards vendors and\nusers!\n\nHere are some of what you can expect from Particl in the next couple of weeks.\n\n * The first public testnet build should be ready and made available in a very\n   short amount of time. You’ll then be able to test and play around with\n   Particl V3 for the first time, on testnet.\n * Particl.news has been completely rebranded and will launch in a few days.\n   Particl’s official blog has moved from Medium onto Ghost. The move brings on\n   added functionality for blog posts, a better user experience, and one that is\n   more tailored to Particl.\n * The Particl Academy will launch and provide very easy to understand\n   tutorials, guides, and walk-through guides for people to quickly understand\n   how to use Particl. The academy will release a few days after the public\n   testnet build goes live and contains a massive amount of content.\n * More vendor and customer outreach and onboarding efforts will start once\n   Particl V3 is live. Whereas 2020 was almost exclusively focused on BUIDL,\n   2021 will be much more about the adoption of the marketplace.\n * An automated system to seed the marketplace with thousands of listings will\n   be announced in the next coming days and will be pushed to the CCS for\n   funding. This initiative is a side-project of Particl team members Juha\n   Kovanen and Cryptoguard and serves many different purposes at once. It is\n   also intended to serve as an example for a typical proposal that anyone in\n   the community could come up with and will jumpstart the adoption of Particl\n   Marketplace and the CCS.\n * The Particl team will go through a “monitoring” phase for about a month or so\n   following the mainnet release of V3. This will allow them to detect and fix\n   bugs, collect feedback from the community, apply them to Particl V3.1, and\n   set the ground to establish the development priorities for 2021 and onward.\n * The website will be entirely rebranded and released to support the V3 release\n   and improve the communication of Particl’s mission, products, and brand.\n   Depending on how fast Particl V3 moves from testnet to mainnet, the rebrand\n   of the website may go live only after the mainnet release.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Wait is Almost Over\nThis week, what is supposed to be the last internal build before the public\ntestnet release has been compiled and been going through one final internal\ntesting round.\n\nThat means that the almost year-long wait is almost over! Starting with the\ntestnet release, a lot of exciting stuff will start coming out and a lot of what\nthe team has been quietly working on in the background will be revealed. As\nalways, we don’t want to commit to a specific date or ETA for release, but that\ninformation alone should give you a pretty good idea of where we stand.\n\nFor this reason, stay eyes on the target and don’t miss the announcement of the\npublic testnet coming shortly on Particl.news [https://particl.news/]!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

However, Tecnovert, Particl’s lead cryptographer, has been working on other stuff in the meantime.</p><h2 id=\"xmr-part-atomic-swap\">XMR — PART Atomic Swap</h2><h2 id=\"tecnovert-xmrswap\">tecnovert/xmrswap</h2><h3 id=\"implementation-of-the-h4sh3d-bitcoin-monero-cross-chain-atomic-swap-protocol-\">Implementation of the h4sh3d Bitcoin-Monero Cross-chain Atomic Swap protocol…</h3><h4 id=\"github-com\">github.com</h4><p>Not too long ago, he released the <a href=\"http://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap\" rel=\"noopener\">xmrswap protocol</a> which allows XMR and PART to be exchanged via atomic swaps. For those who don’t know, atomic swaps are contracts of exchange and executed between two users without the assistance of any third-party. They are uncensorable, private, and fully decentralized swaps of value from one cryptocurrency to the other.</p><h2 id=\"particl-core-0-21-1-0\">Particl Core 0.21.1.0</h2><p>He has also put a lot of work into updating the current Particl Core version (0.19) to the latest Bitcoin version (0.21). Since it has been some time since the latest Core update, it’s taken a significant amount of work to complete but it was well worth it due to what’s being introduced by it.</p><p>On Monday the 23rd of November, 2020, Tecnovert has finally pre-released Particl Core 0.21.1.0 on mainnet. We highly recommend downloading and installing the new core version and testing it out. That’ll provide valuable feedback to Tecnovert which he’ll be able to use to finish off the release and push it as a full release.</p><ul><li><strong>Download: </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.1.0rc1\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.1.0rc1</a></li></ul><p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> This release re-introduces 32bit builds which have been requested by some community members. If you happen to be one of those, please download and test these in your environment and report back to the #Development channel.</em></p><h2 id=\"taproot-readiness\">Taproot Readiness</h2><p>Upgrading to the newest core version of Particl introduces the required code for Taproot to make its way onto Particl.</p><p>Taproot is a form of transaction based on “MAST”, but with a little tweak, that allows you to make a complicated conditional transaction (i.e. atomic swap) look like a typical transaction. In Particl’s case, this new feature is specially intended to increase the privacy level of atomic swaps by having them look like any other regular transaction to the outside observer. Check <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/taproot-merged-bitcoin-core\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>this article from CoinDesk</strong></a> for more information about this new protocol improvement.</p><h2 id=\"blockbook-integration\">BlockBook Integration</h2><p>Particl’s invaluable core developer Kewde has recently been working on adding support for Blockbook, a Trezor-compatible block explorer with some extra features. The support should be available within the new few days now, watch for any <a href=\"https://particl.news/\" rel=\"noopener\">Particl.news</a> blog post about it in the coming days.</p><h1 id=\"particl-marketplace-v3-\">Particl Marketplace (V3)</h1><p>In reality, there is very little left to do before the V3 release is ready for public testing.</p><p>- The V3 market codebase has recently been pushed on Github and is now available for public audit. The codebase is complete with all V3 additions and refactored code in place. You can follow its progress and check out the changes here: <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-market/commits/develop\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/particl/particl-market/commits/develop</a></p><p>- During the internal round of testing that’s been going for a couple of weeks now, a bunch of new issues related to the Windows build have popped up and required developers to allocate extra time to them. They have all been resolved as of last week, but please be on the lookout for any Windows-related issues when testing Particl V3 on Windows.</p><p>- It was announced two weeks ago that only notifications and comments needed to be completed before the public release of testnet builds. As of today, it can be reported that the notifications have been fully completed and are currently being tested in recent internal builds.</p><p>- Some issues have arisen concerning the buyflow integration of comments (buyer/seller communication). As the changes required to fix the problem may take some time, the team is exploring releasing the testnet build without this portion of the comment feature for now and integrating it either during public testnet or as a V3.1 release.</p><p>- Current builds have been tested quite extensively by now. The public testnet is expected to go very smoothly and be short in duration before the release can move up onto the mainnet.</p><h1 id=\"in-app-swap-module\">In-app Swap Module</h1><p>Particl’s SMSG bot framework has been significantly improved, but the in-app swap module still requires a bit of work for it to be completely finished off. Additionally, some of Particl’s swap partners (SimpleSwap, StealthEX, and SwapSpace) have been experiencing issues with the PART pair and are actively working on bringing back up.</p><p>The Particl team and these teams have been in constant communication for a while now. The issue is related to Bittrex which has recently changed the terms of how they want to work with swap businesses using their APIs. The exchanges are stating that they are working on solutions to bring PART back up on the exchanges, but it may take some time.</p><p>For this reason, the in-app swap module may unfortunately not be part of the initial V3 release and may, instead, be pushed to the 3.1 release or whenever PART gets back up on these exchanges. Exactly when this happens is yet to be determined but is partly dependent on factors external to Particl.</p><hr><h1 id=\"team-update\">Team Update</h1><p>A few weeks ago and effective at that time, the Particl team and Foundation mutually agreed to take proactive measures to ensure the continued development of the project while at the same time cutting down the costs to the minimum.</p><h2 id=\"cutting-down-on-the-costs\">Cutting Down on the Costs</h2><p>As a result, all salaried Particl team members have agreed to momentarily not take a salary while at the same time pledging to continue the development of the project and its roadmap.</p><p>This is only possible thanks to the passion of each Particl team member and their commitment to Particl’s mission of a more fair, free, and secure environment of eCommerce.</p><h2 id=\"what-does-this-change\">What does this change?</h2><p>In reality, this won’t change much in the sense that the roadmap will still be worked on as planned earlier this year. It does, however, change how the team will approach tackling the roadmap items needed to complete. Here are a few expected changes as a result of this new reality.</p><ol><li>The project will be managed a bit differently in the background with a focus on maximum cost reduction. This includes using different tools, streamlining processes, and refocusing the development strategy of the project. This may not cause a lot of visible changes to the outside environment but will be key to the continued success of the project and the reduction of its costs.</li><li>Some independent initiatives may be pushed by team members, their partners, or outside contractors through the CCS system. The Particl team highly encourages and supports community members making their own proposals.</li><li>Particl team members may independently work with or help different projects which are working on directly expanding Particl’s ecosystem. These may include various independent initiatives, Particl-based applications or businesses, service providers, and etc. Over the past few weeks, there has been a lot brewing in that important regard which has kept some of Particl team members very busy. More details on the topic will be provided at a later date.</li></ol><h2 id=\"important-focus-on-ccs\">Important Focus on CCS</h2><p>The Particl team has recently released the CCS, a community crowdfunding tool. Moving forward, the team may use this system to push independent initiatives or community votes. The team strongly recommends the community to also come up with its own initiatives to further decentralize the evolution of the Particl ecosystem and stimulate its economy.</p><p>If you have any ideas or proposals, don’t hesitate to reach out to fellow Particl community or team members for help. The CCS is the perfect system to kickstart Particl’s economy and will prove very useful over time.</p><h2 id=\"revamped-particl-wiki\">Revamped Particl Wiki</h2><p>The <a href=\"https://particl.wiki\" rel=\"noopener\">Particl Wiki</a> has recently been significantly improved thanks to the incredible work done by Allien, Particl’s UI/UX Lead. It features a much better navigation/structure and provides a lot of technical documentation and guides. The Particl Wiki, which focused on the advanced user, serves as a great complement to the incoming Particl Academy which will instead focus on the “general user” by making all the information as simple to follow and easy to understand as possible.</p><hr><h1 id=\"what-s-coming\">What’s Coming</h1><p>There are a lot of really great things coming for Particl. Whereas 2020 has been a significant development-focused year for Particl, mainly because the great majority of the time has been spent on Particl’s massive V3 update, 2021 should feel more active in terms of outreach and marketing efforts towards vendors and users!</p><p>Here are some of what you can expect from Particl in the next couple of weeks.</p><ul><li>The <strong>first public testnet</strong> build should be ready and made available in a very short amount of time. You’ll then be able to test and play around with Particl V3 for the first time, on testnet.</li><li><strong>Particl.news has been completely rebranded</strong> and will launch in a few days. Particl’s official blog has moved from Medium onto Ghost. The move brings on added functionality for blog posts, a better user experience, and one that is more tailored to Particl.</li><li>The <strong>Particl Academy</strong> will launch and provide very easy to understand tutorials, guides, and walk-through guides for people to quickly understand how to use Particl. The academy will release a few days after the public testnet build goes live and contains a massive amount of content.</li><li><strong>More vendor and customer outreach and onboarding efforts</strong> will start once Particl V3 is live. Whereas 2020 was almost exclusively focused on BUIDL, 2021 will be much more about the adoption of the marketplace.</li><li><strong>An automated system to seed the marketplace with thousands of listings</strong> will be announced in the next coming days and will be pushed to the CCS for funding. This initiative is a side-project of Particl team members Juha Kovanen and Cryptoguard and serves many different purposes at once. It is also intended to serve as an example for a typical proposal that anyone in the community could come up with and will jumpstart the adoption of Particl Marketplace and the CCS.</li><li>The Particl team will go through a<strong> “monitoring” phase</strong> for about a month or so following the mainnet release of V3.

[http://ccs.particl.io] \nhas been live, and there’s been a bit of action with it in the past few days.\nFor this reason, we’ve prepared a small update for the community.\n\nAs a reminder, the Community Crowdfunding System (CCS) is Particl’s brand new\nsystem for the community to push proposals to collect donations from the\ncommunity or pass ideas to a provably fair vote. Proposals can be any community\nproject, initiative, service, or desired feature that may require funding or a\nvote to be initiated.\n\nTo learn about the CCS in more detail, follow this link\n[https://particl.news/new-community-crowdfunding-system-f31f54231982].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe CCS Sees its First Proposal\nRoughly three weeks ago, Particl’s CCS saw its first proposal ever being\npublished by a community member. Please join with the Particl team to\ncongratulate and thank community member Ozandalgali for breaking the ice and\nbeing the first in Particl history to push a proposal on the CCS!\n\nAlthough relatively small in scope, the proposal requests a modest amount of\nPART for the funding of the creation of an explainer GIF to quickly illustrate\nthe concept of Particl’s novel two-party escrow system. Because Particl’s escrow\nsystem is quite different from what most people are used to when shopping or\nselling online (it uses the MAD game-theory instead of a third-party holding\nfunds on behalf of both users), this GIF will be quite helpful to help newcomers\nin understanding how it works.\n\nThis proposal inaugurated the CCS system and has now been pushed to the “Funding\nRequired” phase just a few moments ago. This means that anyone can now donate to\nthe initiative and get it moving. Particl’s Lead Brand Designer and UI/UX Lead\nGerlof van Ek (Crz) has already pledged to create the GIF.\n\nOnce again, thank you, Ozandalgali, for breaking the ice and anchoring yourself\nin Particl’s history!\n\n> To learn more about the proposal, click here\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/mad-escrow-GIF.html].\nA Second CCS Proposal Followed Suite\nJust a few days ago, a second proposal was pushed to the CCS proposal. This\ntime, it was pushed by two Particl team members — Juha Kovanen (Ludx) and\nCryptoguard. This proposal is relatively more extensive in scope than the first\none, and it aims at supporting the release of the groundbreaking and\nlong-anticipated Particl V3 release.\n\nThe proposal suggests funding for developing, deploying, and maintaining an\nautomated system that will list thousands of items on Particl V3, shipped from\nvarious locations. The system will also automatically process orders on Particl,\nreducing the time to move the escrow steps to the bare minimum technically\npossible for the network. This will tremendously reduce the gap (in terms of\nshopping experience) between traditional marketplaces and Particl’s\ndecentralized approach.\n\nThis proposal goes hand in hand with future outreach and user acquisition\nefforts. It is currently in the “idea phase” of the CCS, which means that it is\nstill up for discussion, comments, feedback, and amendment proposals. If you\nwant to partake in the discussion, head over to the proposal’s page and leave a\nreply at the bottom.\n\n> To learn more about the proposal, click here\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/3].\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDecentralizing Particl Even More\nA few weeks ago, it was mentioned in the November Project Update\n[https://particl.news/project-update-26-11-2020-2bdaedb3e96b] that the Particl\nteam has decided to hold off from collecting a salary for their work\nmomentarily. As an alternative, it is likely that a few proposals here and there\nmay be pushed, independently by team members, to the CCS from time to time.\n\nThis new approach increases the project’s community aspect and gives all of its\nmembers much more decisional power. Indeed, the community can now approve or\ndisapprove current and future proposals by either donating or not and letting\ntheir voice be heard. It also gives the community all the tools they need to\ngather support from other members for any idea or project they may have that\ndirectly benefits Particl. No more does everything have to go through the team, \nanyone can now steer this ship that is the Particl project!\n\nYou can now expect a few proposals, sponsored by team members or managed by\nthem, to go live on the CCS. Some of them may involve some team members working\non initiatives, while others may involve third-party contractors or partners\nwith whom the team has developed relationships. There are a few initiatives in\nthe pipeline that should be soon published, and the team is looking forward to\npresenting them to you!\n\nOn-Chain Voting is Coming to the CCS\nThe Particl team has been working on a new on-chain voting system and will be\nintegrating it into the CCS shortly. This will give the system more flexibility\nand allow anyone to push proposals that may require a community vote to move\nforward. This can be, for example, a proposal that suggests a modification to\nParticl Core or another critical aspect of the ecosystem.\n\nThe ability to push proposals that require voting may also be used by anyone in\nthe community to spend, move, or manage the Community Fund’s funds. More\ndetailed information on the topic will be provided at a later point in the\nfuture.\n\nA Strong Community Project!\nThe Marketplace Listing Seeding\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/3] proposal partly intends to\nshowcase what kind of proposals anyone can present to the community. It can\nserve as an example to follow by anyone. In no way is the CCS exclusive to the\nteam. On the contrary, it is intended to give more power and tools to the\ncommunity to work on and develop their ideas independently.\n\nDo you have an idea in mind that would benefit the Particl ecosystem? Something\nyou’ve dreamt of for a long time? Now’s the time to get it going! All you have\nto do is thoughtfully plan your idea, find the team to work on it (if you\nrequire additional people to help you out), and write a detailed proposal for\nthe community to fund.

✅\nSince the last Development Update\n[https://particl.news/development-update-10-08-2020-d0c1e6b29ad0], Particl V3\nhas progressed remarkably well and has finally been compiled into a working\nbuild this past Friday, the 15th of October 2020, which is currently undergoing\ninternal testing before going live.\n\nParticl V3 is the upcoming massive Particl update. It brings forward a\ncompletely new and improved desktop application, a refactored marketplace with\nbetter performance than ever, and a ton of long-awaited features such as, among\nmany, multi-markets. To learn more about Particl V3, head over to this blog post\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813] \nor check out this article\n[https://dt.gl/decommerce-is-about-to-become-a-reality-2/] published today on \nDecentralize Today [http://decentralize.today].\n\nStepping Things Up Again With Particl Desktop 3.0A New Breakthrough for Privacy\nand eCommerce ?particl.news\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\nWe’ve got a lot to report on today, and a few surprise features and\nfunctionalities as well, so let’s jump into it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl V3 Progress Report\nAs announced on the 15th of October\n[https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1316810699650277376], the first\nsuccessful build of Particl V3 has been compiled and the client has been going\nthrough thorough internal testing before it can be published publicly.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.0 Splash Screen (WIP)So where do things stand now, considering\nthat important development milestone is reached? Here is the latest progress\nreport which should give you a good overall idea.\n\n- All core functionalities of the marketplace have been completed and\nsuccessfully integrated into the improved Particl Desktop 3.0 client. “Core\nfunctionalities” refer to all basic marketplace interactions, including the\nselling and purchasing of products, the escrow system, the creation/sharing of\nmulti-markets, etc.\n\n- Particl Desktop 3.0 is now at feature parity level with Particl Desktop 2.0,\nmeaning that all desktop features that were present on Particl Desktop up to\nParticl Desktop 2.1 are now present in 3.0 and working fine. This excludes all\nthe new features introduced by 3.0, which are now integrated as well.\n\n- New features introduced by Particl V3 are completed, successfully integrated,\nand undergoing internal testing. These include multi-markets and storefronts,\nuser identities, modular approach to desktop client, coin control, anon listing\nfees, increased default ring signatures, anon order releasing, user market\ndashboard, UTXO splitter, etc, More information on some of these features in the\nfollowing section.\n\nParticl Desktop Market Overview (WIP)- Pre-existing features introduced in versions between Particl Desktop 2.0 and\nthe current latest version (2.3.5) are currently being reworked and improved to\nreach much smoother integrations and interaction with the new 3.0. These include \ncomments, as well as its new integration within the buy flow (you can now\ncommunicate with the other party, in the middle of an escrow transaction, to\nresolve any potential issue), bulk product import, and in-app swap module. These\nspecific items are not expected to take much longer before they are fully ready.\n\n- The first few internal builds of Particl V3 (there have been now over 5\niterations of it, each improving on previous issues and fixing bugs) have been \nvery stable, fast, and smooth considering the scope of the improvements and new\nfeatures added. There have, however, been a few issues notably with the speed\nand stability of Windows builds and this has been a major point of focus for the\nteam during the past few days. It has now identified the root of these issues\nand is in the process of promptly applying the required fixes.\n\n- Minor bugs and issues are being picked up and addressed all throughout this\ninternal testing phase.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNew Features and Functionalities Announcement\nParticl V3 introduces a bunch of new features and functionalities that\nsignificantly improves the user experience. Most of these additions are a direct\nresult of feedback and comments collected from you and all other Particl\ncommunity members. Because of this, the Particl team would like to thank you for\nhelping to identify areas of struggle and help improve DeCommerce.\n\nWe are excited to announce today a few features which have either been\nunannounced as of yet or have received minimal coverage. They are as follows.\n\nCoin Control Arrives in Particl Desktop\nParticl Desktop’s Coin Control (WIP)This feature was teased on Twitter\n[https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1300772895812091907] on the first of\nSeptember and can now finally be revealed. Coin Control is the ability to better\ncontrol the parameters of a transaction by selecting exactly which output(s) to\nuse when sending funds.\n\nAlthough this is an advanced feature, it is very useful to a lot of users which\nforced them to constantly switch between Particl Desktop and Particl-Qt wallets\njust to properly manage their outgoing transactions. Coin Control is now\navailable right from Particl Desktop!\n\nAnonymous Payment of Listing Fees (Anon Balances)\nIn Particl V2, listings used to be paid with public balances. Although that is\nstill the default behavior, you can now easily choose to pay for listing fees\nusing your anon balance. This significantly improves the level of privacy when\nadding listings to the marketplace, but it also has a few drawbacks such as\nlonger delays for listings to appear on the marketplace and can also negatively\nimpact the ability to list multiple listings at once.\n\nThat’s because anon “outputs” require 12 confirmations until they are confirmed\nby the network and can be used in new transactions. If you want to list multiple\nlistings at once and pay for the listing fees using your anon balance, you’ll at\nleast need as many anon outputs as the number of listings you’re trying to list\nat once.\n\nUTXO splitter\nTo facilitate the creation of many anon outputs, Particl V3 will also introduce\na UTXO splitter. This will allow you to set up your balances in such a way that\nyou’re going to be able to buy and sell multiple listings at once.\n\nWhen converting funds from a public balance to an anon balance, it used to\ncreate a single output. Outputs are kind of like internal balances that are used\nto execute transactions. A single address may have multiple outputs.\n\nWhenever you need to make an anon transaction, for example paying for an item,\nlisting a product on the marketplace, or just privately sending funds to\nsomeone, it locks the full amount contained in the output for 12 confirmations\n(~24 minutes). That’s true even if you don’t use the total number of coins\ncontained in that output. And then, if you had, for example, 2 outputs in a\nsingle address and tried to purchase 3 items, then you would have only been able\nto buy 2 items and then having to wait 24 minutes just to buy the third one. Of\ncourse, if the cost of an item can’t be covered by the full amount contained in\na single output, then 2 or more outputs may be used to cover the payment,\nleading to even more annoyances.\n\nWith Particl V3, you’ll now be able to specify how many outputs you want\nwhenever making an anon transaction (or balance conversion). The recommended\nbehavior is to create multiple outputs whenever converting balances, that way\nyou’ll ensure that you’re not going to encounter any bumps when making\nmarketplace payments for multiple listings at once.\n\nOrder Payments and Escrow Deposits Now Sent in Anon Balances\nIn Particl V2, order payments and escrow security deposits used to be sent into\nblind balances once transactions were completed. That is not the case anymore.\n\nWhen completing a transaction, you will receive your due funds into your anon\nbalance. This improves the level of privacy associated with using Particl\nMarketplace to even higher than before and makes it impossible for outside\nobservers to track the revenue of sellers and deposits of buyers.\n\nHigher Default Value for the Number of Ring Signatures\nNew Default Ring Signature Number (WIP)When making an anon transaction (RingCT),\nyour privacy is protected using what’s referred to as “ring signatures” (read\nthe Particl Explained — Private Transactions\n[https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd] \narticle for more details). As a general rule of thumb, the more ring signatures\nused in a transaction, the greater your level of privacy gets. But much more\nthan that, a higher number of ring signatures also improves the level of privacy\nof other users’ anon transactions.\n\nWith Particl Desktop 3.0, the number of default ring signatures used to\nanonymize RingCT transactions (anon) has been increased to 24. You, as well as\neveryone else making anonymous transactions, will now benefit from greater data\nsecurity!.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThoughts From Particl Desktop Developer Arnold Bansermer\nRecently, Particl Desktop developer Arnold Bansemer commented on a question from\nthe community about the perceived slow speed development for Particl V3. Because\nhis reply provides valuable insights into the process, we’ve decided to include\nit in this Development Update so that you can get an inside perspective on the\nmatter.\n\n“I want to mention that development is not occurring slowly. It’s progressing at\na much faster pace than what we were producing before. It may appear slow from\nthe outset perhaps due to visibility over the changes actually being made, so\nperhaps this is the actual concern.\n\nBut for perspective — in basically ten months, we’ve done major surgery on both\nParticl Desktop and the marketplace codebase which are both nearing release\nreadiness. That’s compared to Particl V2 (which includes Particl Desktop 2.0 to\nthe current version that’s live on mainnet) which took a lot longer than ten\nmonths to complete, taking in fact more than two years. That’s on top of doing\nthe R&D that’s necessary to actually make the newer stuff work.\n\nKeep in mind that this isn’t some copy/paste job, so when adding/updating\nfunctionalities we need to figure it out as well, and find a way to do it\nwithout sacrificing security/privacy which are core Particl values, or degrading\nthe UX significantly, etc.\n\nAll of that is coming from a team that’s a lot smaller than most dev products\nout there as it is, let alone in the crypto space. So while team members and\ndevelopers might seem quiet, it’s because we’re mostly focused on getting the\napplications finalized.”— Arnold Bansemer, Lead Particl Desktop Developer\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArriving at Destination\nThe Particl team would like to thank you for your continued support and patience \nin this long journey that has been the development of Particl V3. The team is\nfully aware of your expectations and is confident that V3’s release will be\nmeaningful not only for the Particl project but the entire world of DeCommerce.\nPlease bear with us as we thoroughly test the new builds and ensure the release\ngets the impact it deserves.\n\nThe team is very excited to finally be reaching the end of this phase of\ndevelopment and looks forward to embarking on new challenges following this\nlong-awaited release.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

Because of this, <strong>the Particl team would like to thank you</strong> for helping to identify areas of struggle and help improve DeCommerce.</p><p>We are excited to announce today a few features which have either been unannounced as of yet or have received minimal coverage. They are as follows.</p><h3 id=\"coin-control-arrives-in-particl-desktop\">Coin Control Arrives in Particl Desktop</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*MOG23cQ1lv3sEYuCm_Rwug.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Particl Desktop’s Coin Control&nbsp;(WIP)</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ParticlProject/status/1300772895812091907\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>This feature was teased on Twitter</strong></a> on the first of September and can now finally be revealed. Coin Control is the ability to better control the parameters of a transaction by selecting exactly which output(s) to use when sending funds.</p><p>Although this is an advanced feature, it is very useful to a lot of users which forced them to constantly switch between Particl Desktop and Particl-Qt wallets just to properly manage their outgoing transactions. <strong>Coin Control is now available right from Particl Desktop!</strong></p><h3 id=\"anonymous-payment-of-listing-fees-anon-balances-\">Anonymous Payment of Listing Fees (Anon Balances)</h3><p>In Particl V2, listings used to be paid with public balances. Although that is still the default behavior, <strong>you can now easily choose to pay for listing fees using your anon balance</strong>. This significantly improves the level of privacy when adding listings to the marketplace, but it also has a few drawbacks such as longer delays for listings to appear on the marketplace and can also negatively impact the ability to list multiple listings at once.</p><p>That’s because anon “outputs” require 12 confirmations until they are confirmed by the network and can be used in new transactions. If you want to list multiple listings at once and pay for the listing fees using your anon balance, you’ll at least need as many anon outputs as the number of listings you’re trying to list at once.</p><h3 id=\"utxo-splitter\">UTXO splitter</h3><p>To facilitate the creation of many anon outputs, Particl V3 will also introduce a UTXO splitter. This will allow you to set up your balances in such a way that you’re going to be able to buy and sell multiple listings at once.</p><p>When converting funds from a public balance to an anon balance, it used to create a single output. Outputs are kind of like internal balances that are used to execute transactions. A single address may have multiple outputs.</p><p>Whenever you need to make an anon transaction, for example paying for an item, listing a product on the marketplace, or just privately sending funds to someone, it locks the full amount contained in the output for 12 confirmations (~24 minutes). That’s true even if you don’t use the total number of coins contained in that output. And then, if you had, for example, 2 outputs in a single address and tried to purchase 3 items, then you would have only been able to buy 2 items and then having to wait 24 minutes just to buy the third one. Of course, if the cost of an item can’t be covered by the full amount contained in a single output, then 2 or more outputs may be used to cover the payment, leading to even more annoyances.</p><p>With Particl V3, <strong>you’ll now be able to specify how many outputs you want whenever making an anon transaction (or balance conversion)</strong>. The recommended behavior is to create multiple outputs whenever converting balances, that way you’ll ensure that you’re not going to encounter any bumps when making marketplace payments for multiple listings at once.</p><h3 id=\"order-payments-and-escrow-deposits-now-sent-in-anon-balances\">Order Payments and Escrow Deposits Now Sent in Anon Balances</h3><p>In Particl V2, order payments and escrow security deposits used to be sent into blind balances once transactions were completed. That is not the case anymore.</p><p><strong>When completing a transaction, you will receive your due funds into your anon balance</strong>. This improves the level of privacy associated with using Particl Marketplace to even higher than before and makes it impossible for outside observers to track the revenue of sellers and deposits of buyers.</p><h3 id=\"higher-default-value-for-the-number-of-ring-signatures\">Higher Default Value for the Number of Ring Signatures</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*u7hY_BM3Zf4QeHpFylnMgQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>New Default Ring Signature Number&nbsp;(WIP)</figcaption></figure><p>When making an anon transaction (RingCT), your privacy is protected using what’s referred to as “ring signatures” (read the <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Particl Explained — Private Transactions</strong></a> article for more details). As a general rule of thumb, the more ring signatures used in a transaction, the greater your level of privacy gets. But much more than that, a higher number of ring signatures also improves the level of privacy of other users’ anon transactions.</p><p>With Particl Desktop 3.0, <strong>the number of default ring signatures used to anonymize RingCT transactions (anon) has been increased to 24</strong>. You, as well as everyone else making anonymous transactions, will now benefit from greater data security!.</p><hr><h3 id=\"thoughts-from-particl-desktop-developer-arnold-bansermer\">Thoughts From Particl Desktop Developer Arnold Bansermer</h3><p>Recently, Particl Desktop developer Arnold Bansemer commented on a question from the community about the perceived slow speed development for Particl V3. Because his reply provides valuable insights into the process, we’ve decided to include it in this Development Update so that you can get an inside perspective on the matter.</p><p><em>“I want to mention that development is not occurring slowly. It’s progressing at a much faster pace than what we were producing before. It may appear slow from the outset perhaps due to visibility over the changes actually being made, so perhaps this is the actual concern.</em></p><p><em>But for perspective — in basically ten months, we’ve done major surgery on both Particl Desktop and the marketplace codebase which are both nearing release readiness.

the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
