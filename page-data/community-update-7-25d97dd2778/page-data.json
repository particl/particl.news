Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\n(4:07 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=4m8s]) Is it still the plan to integrate\nChangelly directly within Particl Desktop.\nYes. We still have big plans for Changelly, and we definitely think they will\nhelp a lot make our currency-agnostic vision become reality by providing a wide\narray of coins as well as the liquidity to support each of them. They also\nprovide a great developer API toolkit which will allow us to experiment with a\nlot of what they offer and make the integration that much easier.\n\nAs per our currency-agnostic approach, we are designing Particl Desktop (our\nmain wallet) in such a way that it could easily integrate Changelly, but also\nany other similar service. That means that while we are going to integrate\nChangelly directly within Particl Desktop, we may end up integrating several\nother services, some that may provide different coins, features, and services.\nWe believe that Particl’s agnostic approach will help get the marketplace much\nmore adoption as well as empower other cryptocurrency communities by providing\nthem more utility and a convenient way to spend their coins.\n\n(4:07 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfKSgp5WtJ4&feature=youtu.be&t=4m8s]) Is\nit currently being worked on?\nThe team is currently focused on the development of the Beta version of Particl\nMarketplace and the integration is not being actively worked on right now as it\nhasn’t been identified as a “Beta item”. We’ve also approached Changelly to\ndiscuss including them in one of our testnet iteration of Particl Marketplace,\nbut they do not operate a testnet or test version of their product, so that\nmakes integrating Changelly impossible within any of our testnet version.\n\nDon’t forget that Particl Desktop is still designed in such a way that would\nmake this integration easy to set up and, as we go down the list of priorities,\nthis will be worked on after the release of Particl Marketplace Beta. Being\ncurrency-agnostic is and will stay one of our core vision.\n\nWe would like to mention that it is always possible to see what’s currently\nbeing worked on right and what’s scheduled to be worked on after that by\nchecking out our Status Report [http://particl.io/status-report/] page on \nparticl.io [http://particl.io].\n\n(10:14 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=10m14s]) Can the team make atomic swaps\nmore user-friendly?\nAs it currently stands today, atomic swaps (the trustless coin exchanging\nprotocol) are very rough around the edges and most definitely a bleeding-edge\nway to trade cryptocurrencies mostly reserved for advanced users. There are no\neasy-to-understand guides out there yet, and the number of people willing to\ntrade their coin through atomic swaps is definitely limited for the moment.\n\nAt Particl more precisely, we’ve had atomic swaps ready on mainnet ever since\nOctober 2017, but never really have integrated it into any of our wallets so\nfar. As with everything we do, user-friendliness and making available accessible\nsolutions is one of our top priority, so rest assured that our integration of \natomic swaps will be built in such a way that it can be easily used by anyone\nwithout advanced technical knowledge. It might not be perfect on its first\niteration but just like Particl Desktop, for example, it will keep on getting\nimproved as time goes on and as we receive feedback from users. Considering how\nadvanced and complicated executing atomic swaps currently is though, such an\neasy-to-use integration could take some time until it is officially released on\nmainnet. As for the integration itself, we have been bouncing ideas between two\nsolutions:\n\nDecentralized Exchange Dapp for Particl\n\nIt’s been discussed for some time that we might be interested in building a \ndecentralized exchange based on atomic swaps somewhere in the future. This is\nobviously not an item on our current roadmap, nor is this even guaranteed to\never happen, but it is one of the solutions we discussed as being interesting\nfor the platform.\n\nCheckout Option\n\nHaving the ability to have the users choose what payment method they would like\nto use as part of the checkout process might be a more intuitive way to go about\nit. This is, after all, how most eCommerce platforms and plugins do it. This\nwould not require users to store any coin on Particl Desktop and would be a\nreally user-friendly way to use atomic swaps that resembles how people already\ndo online payments.\n\nDecentralized Exchange Integrations\n\nThere are, however, middle-ground solutions that could be deployed in the\nmeantime. In fact, some projects are currently working on\nChangelly/Shapeshift-like services built using atomic swaps and other\ndecentralized means of exchange. These are, of course, not 100% trustless\nsolutions since most of these atomic swap exchanges use centralized order books\nand order matching systems, but they are still considerably more decentralized\nthan their centralized non-custodial counterparts (i.e. Changelly). They also\npresent themselves as interesting solutions as they will likely offer more\nliquidity than bare bone atomic swaps, and could even be able to be integrated\ninto Particl Desktop either as DEXes or checkout options. Some good examples of\nsuch middle-ground services could be found in Altcoin.io [http://altcoin.io/] \nand AtomicWallet [https://atomicwallet.io/].\n\n(16:58 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=16m58s]) Has the NJIT Department of\nTechnology Reviewed a Potential Weakness with RingCT When it Comes to Low Number\nof Transactions?\nFor some context, this question addresses the potential weakness of privacy\nprotocols when confronted with a low amount of transactions. As a general rule\nof thumb, the more private transactions there are on a given chain, the more\nprivate these transactions are estimated to be. We’ve known this potential issue\nfor some time, in fact, this is a problem every single privacy coins have to\ndeal with. This is one of the reasons the marketplace and RingCT are on parallel\ntracks for mainnet release. Indeed, we strongly believe the number of\nmarketplace transactions (since they will all default to RingCT) coupled with\nnon-marketplace RingCT cryptocurrency transactions will at least maintain a\nsolid anonymity set floor that will get higher as other Particl Dapps then start\nto make their appearance in the future. Because a lot of RingCT-based privacy\ncoins are just that, coins, they rely on one single source of transactions\n(currency transactions) to keep their anonymity set high whereas, with Particl,\nreal-world use-case is very likely to help a lot with the quality of the privacy\non the platform.\n\nThat being said, our RingCT implementation has been academically reviewed by the\nNJIT Department of Technology and they’ve focused on various aspects of the\nprotocol, including how to optimize privacy within various anonymity sets and\nways to improve (or maintain) the overall privacy of the protocol when faced\nwith many potential scenarios.\n\nWe’d also like to reemphasize that privacy, security, and decentralization are\nthree of our core values. We absolutely agree that the marketplace should be as\nprivate and secure as it could potentially be once it launches on mainnet, and\nwe are actively researching and working on implementations to make sure these\nthree core values are respected at any time and with all of Particl’s core\nfeatures.\n\n(22:54 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=22m54s]) Is the team looking into other\nprivacy protocols, and if so, what would be the implementation estimate?\nWe are not looking into other privacy schemes, but Tecnovert is currently\nworking on some RingCT improvements he’s been wanting to implement for some time\nnow. Although no major issue or vulnerability has been detected in both WSA’s \nsecurity audit and NJIT’s academic review, some minor issues might have\nconvinced him that it would be worth it to work on the improvements before we\nproceed with our RingCT + governance hardfork. Although these changes do not\nconstitute an outright change of privacy protocol, they are small improvements\nour developers see the need to fix after over 1 year of testing and outside\nreview. It might be interesting to note that, as Dasource/Shazzy (Particl\nResearch & Development) mentioned, these changes being made to the RingCT scheme\ncould mean that the privacy protocol may not be able to be defined as purely a\nring signature + confidential transaction setup (RingCT) but something a bit\ndifferent. These changes will make the RingCT protocol a more private solution\nand one that is potentially cheaper to use.\n\nThe very first commits related to these RingCT improvements have started\nappearing on Github this week. More details will be communicated at a later\ntime. In the meantime, you can have a look at the work being accomplished by\nTecnovert by following the Particl Core repository’s commit page.\n\nParticl-Core — Commits [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master]\nParticl Core integration/staging tree. Contribute to particl/particl-core\ndevelopment by creating an account on GitHub.\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master]github.com\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master]\n\n(26:10 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=26m10s]) Will the team postpone the\nmainnet release of the marketplace in order to make sure Particl’s RingCT\nprivacy is optimal?\nAs mentioned above, privacy is one of our core value and we would not release\nthe marketplace on mainnet until we are fully satisfied with the level of\nprivacy it offers. That being said, we are absolutely confident in the solutions\nand improvements that Tecnovert has identified and started working on, and we\nalso believe that marketplace activity will greatly help with the transaction\npool.\n\nIt’s also very important to note that privacy doesn’t stop at currency\ntransactions. Everything built on Particl is being built with privacy in mind\nand in a constant state of evolution. For example, we are currently making a \nmajor code refactoring of the MAD escrow system which will make it more private \nand again, potentially cheaper to use. Another example of how privacy and\nsecurity are being taken care of at every level of the platform is with the fiat\nprice pegging mechanism. It would be easy to simply integrate some API from\nCoinMarketCap that updates prices every 5 seconds or so, but that would also\nleak some data such as user location based on currency bias that a passive\nobserver could use to start profiling users.\n\nEvery single aspect of Particl Marketplace is built with privacy and security at\nits very core, and all these functions add up in symbiosis and contribute to the\nprivacy factor of the platform. We are in a constant state of research when it\ncomes to security and privacy solutions. As we often say, it’s in our DNA, and\nit is what we are all about!\n\n(28:33 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=28m33s]) When is marketing going to\nkick up?\nInternally, the preparations for the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace has\nalready started. This week, our marketing/comm team has moved to Jira, just like\nour developer team has done earlier this summer. In fact, adopting agile\nmethodologies has made a tremendous difference and helped our dev team a lot in\nattaining better productivity as well as intra-team communication efficiency,\nand we are looking forward to applying this same approach to our marketing/comm\nteam. We’ve also been reshuffling some of our resources, are reviewing our\nbudget, have started contacting some of the people we identify as key people for\nthe launch, and have started drafting various documents and strategies to ensure\nthat Particl Marketplace’s launch is done properly.\n\n(35:11 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=35m11s]) Did Qiang Tang work on private\nlistings for Particl Marketplace?\nNo, this is not part of what they reviewed.\n\n(35:45 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=35m45s]) How much time would it take the\nteam to release private listings on testnet?\nOur team’s goal is to have Particl Marketplace Beta ready by the end of the\nyear, so working back from that point private listings should be released on\ntestnet within that timeframe. Private listings are probably not as critical of\na feature as RingCT and governance, and while we do want this feature to be part\nof the mainnet release, it might also make its appearance on testnet after Beta.\nThe marketplace has, however, been designed with this very feature in mind, and\nthe word from our developers is that it should be relatively easy and quick to\nimplement.\n\nAs with everything, Particl is a project with a lot of moving targets and the\norder and timeframe at which features are released can vary greatly depending on\na multitude of factors.\n\n(37:01 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=37m1s]) If the governance mechanism and\nRingCT work fine, would the marketplace potentially be pushed to mainnet even\nthough all the items identified as Beta items aren’t ready yet?\nAs mentioned above, the two main items required for Beta are the governance\nsystem and RingCT. Other features will also most likely be part of the mainnet\nrelease, although it could be debated whether to include them or not at first if\nthey are not ready and we are “in an urge” to release the marketplace.\n\n(38:14 [https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=38m14s]) Could we at least have one guest\nper AMA/FAQ Livestream to show the project from another perspective?\nYes, we fully agree. Our developers are very busy with the coding part of the\nmarketplace but it would be great to get more guests from time to time. Some of\nour best livestreams happened with some of our developers on. It might be\npossible that for the next livestream we’ll be joined by our Lead Graphic\nDesigner CRZ.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nParticl Desktop 1.2.3 Released\nParticl Desktop 1.2.3 Release\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673]\nRecently, most of the Particl Desktop application development has been focused\non the marketplace, but its wallet…\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673]particl.news\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673]\n\nWe released on the 12th of September Particl Desktop 1.2.3\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.2.3], a major update\non the mainnet wallet capabilities of Particl Desktop. A majority of its user\ninterface has been improved upon as well as made more user-friendly, and a lot\nof bug fixes and stability improvements were implemented to make the Particl\nDesktop experience as smooth as it has ever been! Follow the link above to get\nall the details about this update.\n\nStatus Report\nParticl.io — StatusReport [http://particl.io/status-report/]\nParticl provides a decentralized privacy platform with a suite of tools to\nenhance your online privacy * Private… [http://particl.io/status-report/]\nparticl.io [http://particl.io/status-report/]\n\nWe released on the 14th of September a new Status Report on particl.io\n[http://particl.io]. There are some interesting updates, such as the RingCT\nimplementation (enhancements) and the modification currently being done to the\ngovernance system. In fact, the development team is switching the measurement of\nthe voting period duration on community proposals from a block height base to a\ntime base. It is also possible to see that some of the items related to the\nSettings tab have been moved over to the Review section.\n\nYou may have noticed that on pretty much every Status Reports, there are\nmentions of code refactoring. Indeed, Particl is leading-edge protocol in terms\nof technology, and a lot of what’s being accomplished has never been done in the\npast. While this is most definitely exciting, it is also challenging for our\ndevelopers as there is very little to compare to or use as a comparative figure.\nThis means that, while they are simultaneously building various pieces of the\nParticl puzzle, they might, along the way, figure out better, more efficient\nways to code some stuff. This is what’s called a code refactoring.\n\n> The process of restructuring existing computer code — changing the\nfactoring — without changing its external behavior. Refactoring improves\nnonfunctional attributes of the software. —Wikipedia\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring]\nYou can expect a lot of code refactoring this year as we keep on improving the\nParticl platform and its infrastructure in order to make as smooth, efficient, \npleasant to use, but most importantly, secure and private as possible.\n\nCold Staking Sneak Peek\n> \nWe published last Friday a sneak peek of Tecnovert’s cold staking pool. While it\nis still unclear how exactly this pool will be released, once it does it will\nallow users to delegate their staking powers to a cold staking pool that will\nhave the ability to manage payouts. This means a user with only a few PART coins\ncould receive payouts in smaller increments than a~1.25 PART; Particl’s current\nstaking reward amount. This is a great achievement for our project as that\nheavily reduces the barrier of entry to staking, meaning no one gets left behind\nbased on monetary values.\n\nWe will have more information about the cold staking pool as we near its launch.\n\nCommunity Proposals Make Their Way onto Particl’s Testnet\nAs announced in our last Community Update #6\n[https://particl.news/community-update-6-3ead71971cfe], the governance mechanism\nfor the Community Proposals as seen its first iteration make its way onto\ntestnet. We have now released proper builds to test the feature and anyone in\nthe community can now fire up their testnet Particl Desktop client and test the\nnew feature. We highly suggest that you report any issue you encounter during\nyour testing either in our #testing channel on Discord/Telegram or directly on \nGithub [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] as that helps us fix\nthem more quickly.\n\nNote 1: The marketplace currently does not include any governance tool. The\ngovernance mechanism has only been fully integrated into Community Proposals.\nThe marketplace integration of this mechanism is currently underway and will\ncome in a later update.\n\nNote 2: The testnet is currently on hold and not loading properly. This has to\ndo with the upgrade to the new 0.17 codebase. Our developer team is working on\nfixing the issue and we will publish new builds as soon as it is operational\nagain!\n\nNew Particl Swag Available on Particl Marketplace Alpha\nICOsensei Custom Particl Label Pins Now Available on Particl Marketplace\n[https://particl.news/icosensei-custom-particl-lapel-pins-now-available-in-particl-marketplace-7293f43c29d6]\nWith lots of new features recently released for testing, we thought we’d give\nyou a good reason to come play!\n[https://particl.news/icosensei-custom-particl-lapel-pins-now-available-in-particl-marketplace-7293f43c29d6]\nparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/icosensei-custom-particl-lapel-pins-now-available-in-particl-marketplace-7293f43c29d6]\n\nTo celebrate the Community Proposals feature hitting testnet and to show off the\nenhancements made to the testnet version of Particl Marketplace, we’ve decided\nto make available free Particl pins from our friends over at ICOSensei\n[https://www.icosensei.com/].

In fact,\nthis widely-used mobile application has developed a way for cryptocurrency teams\nto push notifications to their users. This feature, of course, did not launch\nwith every single cryptocurrency at once, and we had been in the “waiting list”\nfor quite some time. We finally had the opportunity to be added and have started\npushing important notifications using the platform.

We still have big plans for <strong>Changelly</strong>, and we definitely think they will help a lot make our currency-agnostic vision become reality by providing a wide array of coins as well as the liquidity to support each of them. They also provide a great developer API toolkit which will allow us to experiment with a lot of what they offer and make the integration that much easier.</p><p>As per our currency-agnostic approach, we are designing Particl Desktop (our main wallet) in such a way that it could easily integrate <strong>Changelly</strong>, but also any other similar service. That means that while we are going to integrate Changelly directly within Particl Desktop, we may end up integrating several other services, some that may provide different coins, features, and services. We believe that Particl’s agnostic approach will help get the marketplace much more adoption as well as empower other cryptocurrency communities by providing them more utility and a convenient way to spend their coins.</p><h3 id=\"-4-07-is-it-currently-being-worked-on\">(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfKSgp5WtJ4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4m8s\">4:07</a>) Is it currently being worked on?</h3><p>The team is currently focused on the development of the Beta version of Particl Marketplace and <strong>the integration is not being actively worked on right now</strong> as it hasn’t been identified as a “Beta item”. We’ve also approached Changelly to discuss including them in one of our testnet iteration of Particl Marketplace, but they do not operate a testnet or test version of their product, so that makes integrating Changelly impossible within any of our testnet version.</p><p>Don’t forget that Particl Desktop is still designed in such a way that would make this integration easy to set up and, as we go down the list of priorities, this will be worked on after the release of Particl Marketplace Beta. Being currency-agnostic is and will stay one of our core vision.</p><p>We would like to mention that it is always possible to see what’s currently being worked on right and what’s scheduled to be worked on after that by checking out our <a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\"><strong>Status Report</strong></a> page on <a href=\"http://particl.io\"><strong>particl.io</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"-10-14-can-the-team-make-atomic-swaps-more-user-friendly\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=10m14s\">10:14</a>) Can the team make atomic swaps more user-friendly?</h3><p>As it currently stands today, <strong>atomic swaps</strong> (the trustless coin exchanging protocol) are very rough around the edges and most definitely a bleeding-edge way to trade cryptocurrencies mostly reserved for advanced users. There are no easy-to-understand guides out there yet, and the number of people willing to trade their coin through atomic swaps is definitely limited for the moment.</p><p>At Particl more precisely, <strong>we’ve had atomic swaps ready on mainnet ever since October 2017</strong>, but never really have integrated it into any of our wallets so far. As with everything we do, user-friendliness and making available accessible solutions is one of our top priority, so rest assured that our integration of <strong>atomic swaps</strong> will be built in such a way that it can be easily used by anyone without advanced technical knowledge. It might not be perfect on its first iteration but just like Particl Desktop, for example, it will keep on getting improved as time goes on and as we receive feedback from users. Considering how advanced and complicated executing <strong>atomic swaps</strong> currently is though, such an easy-to-use integration could take some time until it is officially released on mainnet. As for the integration itself, we have been bouncing ideas between two solutions:</p><p><strong>Decentralized Exchange Dapp for Particl</strong></p><p>It’s been discussed for some time that we might be interested in building a <strong>decentralized exchange based on atomic swaps</strong> somewhere in the future. This is obviously not an item on our current roadmap, nor is this even guaranteed to ever happen, but it is one of the solutions we discussed as being interesting for the platform.</p><p><strong>Checkout Option</strong></p><p>Having the ability to have the users choose what payment method they would like to use <strong>as part of the checkout process</strong> might be a more intuitive way to go about it. This is, after all, how most eCommerce platforms and plugins do it. This would not require users to store any coin on Particl Desktop and would be a really user-friendly way to use atomic swaps that resembles how people already do online payments.</p><p><strong>Decentralized Exchange Integrations</strong></p><p>There are, however, middle-ground solutions that could be deployed in the meantime. In fact, some projects are currently working on Changelly/Shapeshift-like services built using atomic swaps and other decentralized means of exchange. These are, of course, not 100% trustless solutions since most of these atomic swap exchanges use centralized order books and order matching systems, but they are still considerably more decentralized than their centralized non-custodial counterparts (i.e. Changelly). They also present themselves as interesting solutions as they will likely offer more liquidity than bare bone atomic swaps, and could even be able to be integrated into Particl Desktop either as DEXes or checkout options. Some good examples of such middle-ground services could be found in <a href=\"http://altcoin.io/\"><strong>Altcoin.io</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://atomicwallet.io/\"><strong>AtomicWallet</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"-16-58-has-the-njit-department-of-technology-reviewed-a-potential-weakness-with-ringct-when-it-comes-to-low-number-of-transactions\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=16m58s\">16:58</a>) Has the NJIT Department of Technology Reviewed a Potential Weakness with RingCT When it Comes to Low Number of Transactions?</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--7/1-W4AGhjMKDTJ9a2Tf48xerg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>For some context, this question addresses the potential weakness of privacy protocols when confronted with a low amount of transactions. As a general rule of thumb, the more private transactions there are on a given chain, the more private these transactions are estimated to be. We’ve known this potential issue for some time, in fact, this is a problem every single privacy coins have to deal with. This is one of the reasons the marketplace and <strong>RingCT</strong> are on parallel tracks for mainnet release. Indeed, we strongly believe the number of marketplace transactions (since they will all default to <strong>RingCT</strong>) coupled with non-marketplace <strong>RingCT</strong> cryptocurrency transactions will at least maintain a solid anonymity set floor that will get higher as other <strong>Particl</strong> <strong>Dapps</strong> then start to make their appearance in the future. Because a lot of <strong>RingCT</strong>-based privacy coins are just that, coins, they rely on one single source of transactions (currency transactions) to keep their anonymity set high whereas, with Particl, real-world use-case is very likely to help a lot with the quality of the privacy on the platform.</p><p>That being said, our <strong>RingCT</strong> implementation has been academically reviewed by the NJIT Department of Technology and they’ve focused on various aspects of the protocol, including how to optimize privacy within various anonymity sets and ways to improve (or maintain) the overall privacy of the protocol when faced with many potential scenarios.</p><p>We’d also like to reemphasize that <strong>privacy, security, and decentralization are three of our core values</strong>. We absolutely agree that the marketplace should be as private and secure as it could potentially be once it launches on mainnet, and we are actively researching and working on implementations to make sure these three core values are respected at any time and with all of Particl’s core features.</p><h3 id=\"-22-54-is-the-team-looking-into-other-privacy-protocols-and-if-so-what-would-be-the-implementation-estimate\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=22m54s\">22:54</a>) Is the team looking into other privacy protocols, and if so, what would be the implementation estimate?</h3><p>We are not looking into other privacy schemes, but <strong>Tecnovert is currently working on some RingCT improvements</strong> he’s been wanting to implement for some time now. Although no major issue or vulnerability has been detected in both <strong>WSA’s</strong> <strong>security</strong> <strong>audit</strong> and <strong>NJIT’s</strong> <strong>academic</strong> <strong>review</strong>, some minor issues might have convinced him that it would be worth it to work on the improvements before we proceed with our <strong>RingCT</strong> + governance hardfork. Although these changes do not constitute an outright change of privacy protocol, they are small improvements our developers see the need to fix after over 1 year of testing and outside review. It might be interesting to note that, as Dasource/Shazzy (Particl Research &amp; Development) mentioned, these changes being made to the <strong>RingCT</strong> scheme could mean that the privacy protocol may not be able to be defined as purely a ring signature + confidential transaction setup (<strong>RingCT</strong>) but something a bit different. These changes will make the <strong>RingCT</strong> protocol a <strong>more private</strong> solution and one that is potentially <strong>cheaper to use</strong>.</p><p>The very first commits related to these <strong>RingCT</strong> improvements have started appearing on Github this week. More details will be communicated at a later time. In the meantime, you can have a look at the work being accomplished by Tecnovert by following the Particl Core repository’s commit page.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master\"><strong>Particl-Core — Commits</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master\"><em>Particl Core integration/staging tree.

That being said, we are absolutely confident in the solutions and improvements that Tecnovert has identified and started working on, and we also believe that marketplace activity will greatly help with the transaction pool.</p><p>It’s also very important to note that privacy doesn’t stop at currency transactions. Everything built on Particl is being built with privacy in mind and in a constant state of evolution. For example, we are currently making a <strong>major code refactoring of the MAD escrow system</strong> which will make it <strong>more private</strong> and again, potentially <strong>cheaper to use</strong>. Another example of how privacy and security are being taken care of at every level of the platform is with the fiat price pegging mechanism. It would be easy to simply integrate some API from CoinMarketCap that updates prices every 5 seconds or so, but that would also leak some data such as user location based on currency bias that a passive observer could use to start profiling users.</p><p>Every single aspect of Particl Marketplace is built with privacy and security at its very core, and all these functions add up in symbiosis and contribute to the privacy factor of the platform. We are in a constant state of research when it comes to security and privacy solutions. As we often say, it’s in our DNA, and it is what we are all about!</p><h3 id=\"-28-33-when-is-marketing-going-to-kick-up\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=28m33s\">28:33</a>) When is marketing going to kick up?</h3><p>Internally, the preparations for the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace <strong>has already started</strong>. This week, our marketing/comm team has moved to <strong>Jira</strong>, just like our developer team has done earlier this summer. In fact, adopting agile methodologies has made a tremendous difference and helped our dev team a lot in attaining better productivity as well as intra-team communication efficiency, and we are looking forward to applying this same approach to our marketing/comm team. We’ve also been reshuffling some of our resources, are reviewing our budget, have started contacting some of the people we identify as key people for the launch, and have started drafting various documents and strategies to ensure that Particl Marketplace’s launch is done properly.</p><h3 id=\"-35-11-did-qiang-tang-work-on-private-listings-for-particl-marketplace\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=35m11s\">35:11</a>) Did Qiang Tang work on private listings for Particl Marketplace?</h3><p>No, this is not part of what they reviewed.</p><h3 id=\"-35-45-how-much-time-would-it-take-the-team-to-release-private-listings-on-testnet\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=35m45s\">35:45</a>) How much time would it take the team to release private listings on testnet?</h3><p>Our team’s goal is to have Particl Marketplace Beta ready by the end of the year, so working back from that point private listings should be released on testnet within that timeframe. Private listings are probably not as critical of a feature as <strong>RingCT</strong> and governance, and while we do want this feature to be part of the mainnet release, it might also make its appearance on testnet after Beta. The marketplace has, however, been designed with this very feature in mind, and the word from our developers is that it should be relatively easy and quick to implement.</p><p>As with everything, Particl is a project with a lot of moving targets and the order and timeframe at which features are released can vary greatly depending on a multitude of factors.</p><h3 id=\"-37-01-if-the-governance-mechanism-and-ringct-work-fine-would-the-marketplace-potentially-be-pushed-to-mainnet-even-though-all-the-items-identified-as-beta-items-aren-t-ready-yet\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=37m1s\">37:01</a>) If the governance mechanism and RingCT work fine, would the marketplace potentially be pushed to mainnet even though all the items identified as Beta items aren’t ready yet?</h3><p>As mentioned above, the two main items required for Beta are the <strong>governance system</strong> and <strong>RingCT</strong>. Other features will also most likely be part of the mainnet release, although it could be debated whether to include them or not at first if they are not ready and we are “in an urge” to release the marketplace.</p><h3 id=\"-38-14-could-we-at-least-have-one-guest-per-ama-faq-livestream-to-show-the-project-from-another-perspective\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=38m14s\">38:14</a>) Could we at least have one guest per AMA/FAQ Livestream to show the project from another perspective?</h3><p>Yes, we fully agree. Our developers are very busy with the coding part of the marketplace but it would be great to get more guests from time to time. Some of our best livestreams happened with some of our developers on. It might be possible that for the next livestream we’ll be joined by our <strong>Lead Graphic Designer CRZ</strong>.</p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &amp; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-1-2-3-released\">Particl Desktop 1.2.3 Released</h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673\"><strong>Particl Desktop 1.2.3 Release</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673\"><em>Recently, most of the Particl Desktop application development has been focused on the marketplace, but its wallet…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673\">particl.news</a></p><p>We released on the 12th of September <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.2.3\">Particl Desktop 1.2.3</a>, a major update on the <strong>mainnet</strong> wallet capabilities of Particl Desktop.

Follow the link above to get all the details about this update.</p><h3 id=\"status-report\">Status Report</h3><p><a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\"><strong>Particl.io — StatusReport</strong></a><br><a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\"><em>Particl provides a decentralized privacy platform with a suite of tools to enhance your online privacy * Private…</em></a><a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\">particl.io</a></p><p>We released on the 14th of September a new Status Report on <a href=\"http://particl.io\"><strong>particl.io</strong></a>. There are some interesting updates, such as the <strong>RingCT implementation (enhancements)</strong> and the modification currently being done to the governance system. In fact, the development team is <strong>switching the measurement of the voting period duration on community proposals from a block height base to a time base</strong>. It is also possible to see that some of the items related to the Settings tab have been moved over to the Review section.</p><p>You may have noticed that on pretty much every Status Reports, there are mentions of <strong>code refactoring</strong>. Indeed, Particl is leading-edge protocol in terms of technology, and a lot of what’s being accomplished has never been done in the past. While this is most definitely exciting, it is also challenging for our developers as there is very little to compare to or use as a comparative figure. This means that, while they are simultaneously building various pieces of the Particl puzzle, they might, along the way, figure out better, more efficient ways to code some stuff. This is what’s called a <strong>code refactoring</strong>.</p><blockquote>The process of restructuring existing computer code — changing the factoring — without changing its external behavior. Refactoring improves nonfunctional attributes of the software. — <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring\">Wikipedia</a></blockquote><p>You can expect a lot of code refactoring this year as we keep on improving the Particl platform and its infrastructure in order to make as <strong>smooth</strong>, <strong>efficient</strong>, <strong>pleasant to use</strong>, but most importantly, <strong>secure</strong> and <strong>private</strong> as possible.</p><h3 id=\"cold-staking-sneak-peek\">Cold Staking Sneak Peek</h3><blockquote></blockquote><p>We published last Friday a sneak peek of Tecnovert’s <strong>cold staking pool</strong>. While it is still unclear how exactly this pool will be released, once it does it will allow users to delegate their staking powers to a cold staking pool that will have the ability to manage payouts. This means a user with only a few PART coins could receive payouts in smaller increments than a~1.25 PART; Particl’s current staking reward amount. This is a great achievement for our project as that heavily reduces the barrier of entry to staking, meaning no one gets left behind based on monetary values.</p><p>We will have more information about the cold staking pool as we near its launch.</p><h3 id=\"community-proposals-make-their-way-onto-particl-s-testnet\">Community Proposals Make Their Way onto Particl’s Testnet</h3><p>As announced in our last <a href=\"https://particl.news/community-update-6-3ead71971cfe\">Community Update #6</a>, the governance mechanism for the <strong>Community Proposals</strong> as seen its first iteration make its way onto testnet.

We still have big plans for <strong>Changelly</strong>, and we definitely think they will help a lot make our currency-agnostic vision become reality by providing a wide array of coins as well as the liquidity to support each of them. They also provide a great developer API toolkit which will allow us to experiment with a lot of what they offer and make the integration that much easier.</p><p>As per our currency-agnostic approach, we are designing Particl Desktop (our main wallet) in such a way that it could easily integrate <strong>Changelly</strong>, but also any other similar service. That means that while we are going to integrate Changelly directly within Particl Desktop, we may end up integrating several other services, some that may provide different coins, features, and services. We believe that Particl’s agnostic approach will help get the marketplace much more adoption as well as empower other cryptocurrency communities by providing them more utility and a convenient way to spend their coins.</p><h3 id=\"-4-07-is-it-currently-being-worked-on\">(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfKSgp5WtJ4&#x26;feature=youtu.be&#x26;t=4m8s\">4:07</a>) Is it currently being worked on?</h3><p>The team is currently focused on the development of the Beta version of Particl Marketplace and <strong>the integration is not being actively worked on right now</strong> as it hasn’t been identified as a “Beta item”. We’ve also approached Changelly to discuss including them in one of our testnet iteration of Particl Marketplace, but they do not operate a testnet or test version of their product, so that makes integrating Changelly impossible within any of our testnet version.</p><p>Don’t forget that Particl Desktop is still designed in such a way that would make this integration easy to set up and, as we go down the list of priorities, this will be worked on after the release of Particl Marketplace Beta. Being currency-agnostic is and will stay one of our core vision.</p><p>We would like to mention that it is always possible to see what’s currently being worked on right and what’s scheduled to be worked on after that by checking out our <a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\"><strong>Status Report</strong></a> page on <a href=\"http://particl.io\"><strong>particl.io</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"-10-14-can-the-team-make-atomic-swaps-more-user-friendly\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=10m14s\">10:14</a>) Can the team make atomic swaps more user-friendly?</h3><p>As it currently stands today, <strong>atomic swaps</strong> (the trustless coin exchanging protocol) are very rough around the edges and most definitely a bleeding-edge way to trade cryptocurrencies mostly reserved for advanced users. There are no easy-to-understand guides out there yet, and the number of people willing to trade their coin through atomic swaps is definitely limited for the moment.</p><p>At Particl more precisely, <strong>we’ve had atomic swaps ready on mainnet ever since October 2017</strong>, but never really have integrated it into any of our wallets so far. As with everything we do, user-friendliness and making available accessible solutions is one of our top priority, so rest assured that our integration of <strong>atomic swaps</strong> will be built in such a way that it can be easily used by anyone without advanced technical knowledge. It might not be perfect on its first iteration but just like Particl Desktop, for example, it will keep on getting improved as time goes on and as we receive feedback from users. Considering how advanced and complicated executing <strong>atomic swaps</strong> currently is though, such an easy-to-use integration could take some time until it is officially released on mainnet. As for the integration itself, we have been bouncing ideas between two solutions:</p><p><strong>Decentralized Exchange Dapp for Particl</strong></p><p>It’s been discussed for some time that we might be interested in building a <strong>decentralized exchange based on atomic swaps</strong> somewhere in the future. This is obviously not an item on our current roadmap, nor is this even guaranteed to ever happen, but it is one of the solutions we discussed as being interesting for the platform.</p><p><strong>Checkout Option</strong></p><p>Having the ability to have the users choose what payment method they would like to use <strong>as part of the checkout process</strong> might be a more intuitive way to go about it. This is, after all, how most eCommerce platforms and plugins do it. This would not require users to store any coin on Particl Desktop and would be a really user-friendly way to use atomic swaps that resembles how people already do online payments.</p><p><strong>Decentralized Exchange Integrations</strong></p><p>There are, however, middle-ground solutions that could be deployed in the meantime. In fact, some projects are currently working on Changelly/Shapeshift-like services built using atomic swaps and other decentralized means of exchange. These are, of course, not 100% trustless solutions since most of these atomic swap exchanges use centralized order books and order matching systems, but they are still considerably more decentralized than their centralized non-custodial counterparts (i.e. Changelly). They also present themselves as interesting solutions as they will likely offer more liquidity than bare bone atomic swaps, and could even be able to be integrated into Particl Desktop either as DEXes or checkout options. Some good examples of such middle-ground services could be found in <a href=\"http://altcoin.io/\"><strong>Altcoin.io</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://atomicwallet.io/\"><strong>AtomicWallet</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"-16-58-has-the-njit-department-of-technology-reviewed-a-potential-weakness-with-ringct-when-it-comes-to-low-number-of-transactions\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=16m58s\">16:58</a>) Has the NJIT Department of Technology Reviewed a Potential Weakness with RingCT When it Comes to Low Number of Transactions?</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--7/1-W4AGhjMKDTJ9a2Tf48xerg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>For some context, this question addresses the potential weakness of privacy protocols when confronted with a low amount of transactions. As a general rule of thumb, the more private transactions there are on a given chain, the more private these transactions are estimated to be. We’ve known this potential issue for some time, in fact, this is a problem every single privacy coins have to deal with. This is one of the reasons the marketplace and <strong>RingCT</strong> are on parallel tracks for mainnet release. Indeed, we strongly believe the number of marketplace transactions (since they will all default to <strong>RingCT</strong>) coupled with non-marketplace <strong>RingCT</strong> cryptocurrency transactions will at least maintain a solid anonymity set floor that will get higher as other <strong>Particl</strong> <strong>Dapps</strong> then start to make their appearance in the future. Because a lot of <strong>RingCT</strong>-based privacy coins are just that, coins, they rely on one single source of transactions (currency transactions) to keep their anonymity set high whereas, with Particl, real-world use-case is very likely to help a lot with the quality of the privacy on the platform.</p><p>That being said, our <strong>RingCT</strong> implementation has been academically reviewed by the NJIT Department of Technology and they’ve focused on various aspects of the protocol, including how to optimize privacy within various anonymity sets and ways to improve (or maintain) the overall privacy of the protocol when faced with many potential scenarios.</p><p>We’d also like to reemphasize that <strong>privacy, security, and decentralization are three of our core values</strong>. We absolutely agree that the marketplace should be as private and secure as it could potentially be once it launches on mainnet, and we are actively researching and working on implementations to make sure these three core values are respected at any time and with all of Particl’s core features.</p><h3 id=\"-22-54-is-the-team-looking-into-other-privacy-protocols-and-if-so-what-would-be-the-implementation-estimate\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=22m54s\">22:54</a>) Is the team looking into other privacy protocols, and if so, what would be the implementation estimate?</h3><p>We are not looking into other privacy schemes, but <strong>Tecnovert is currently working on some RingCT improvements</strong> he’s been wanting to implement for some time now. Although no major issue or vulnerability has been detected in both <strong>WSA’s</strong> <strong>security</strong> <strong>audit</strong> and <strong>NJIT’s</strong> <strong>academic</strong> <strong>review</strong>, some minor issues might have convinced him that it would be worth it to work on the improvements before we proceed with our <strong>RingCT</strong> + governance hardfork. Although these changes do not constitute an outright change of privacy protocol, they are small improvements our developers see the need to fix after over 1 year of testing and outside review. It might be interesting to note that, as Dasource/Shazzy (Particl Research &#x26; Development) mentioned, these changes being made to the <strong>RingCT</strong> scheme could mean that the privacy protocol may not be able to be defined as purely a ring signature + confidential transaction setup (<strong>RingCT</strong>) but something a bit different. These changes will make the <strong>RingCT</strong> protocol a <strong>more private</strong> solution and one that is potentially <strong>cheaper to use</strong>.</p><p>The very first commits related to these <strong>RingCT</strong> improvements have started appearing on Github this week. More details will be communicated at a later time. In the meantime, you can have a look at the work being accomplished by Tecnovert by following the Particl Core repository’s commit page.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master\"><strong>Particl-Core — Commits</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/commits/master\"><em>Particl Core integration/staging tree.

That being said, we are absolutely confident in the solutions and improvements that Tecnovert has identified and started working on, and we also believe that marketplace activity will greatly help with the transaction pool.</p><p>It’s also very important to note that privacy doesn’t stop at currency transactions. Everything built on Particl is being built with privacy in mind and in a constant state of evolution. For example, we are currently making a <strong>major code refactoring of the MAD escrow system</strong> which will make it <strong>more private</strong> and again, potentially <strong>cheaper to use</strong>. Another example of how privacy and security are being taken care of at every level of the platform is with the fiat price pegging mechanism. It would be easy to simply integrate some API from CoinMarketCap that updates prices every 5 seconds or so, but that would also leak some data such as user location based on currency bias that a passive observer could use to start profiling users.</p><p>Every single aspect of Particl Marketplace is built with privacy and security at its very core, and all these functions add up in symbiosis and contribute to the privacy factor of the platform. We are in a constant state of research when it comes to security and privacy solutions. As we often say, it’s in our DNA, and it is what we are all about!</p><h3 id=\"-28-33-when-is-marketing-going-to-kick-up\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=28m33s\">28:33</a>) When is marketing going to kick up?</h3><p>Internally, the preparations for the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace <strong>has already started</strong>. This week, our marketing/comm team has moved to <strong>Jira</strong>, just like our developer team has done earlier this summer. In fact, adopting agile methodologies has made a tremendous difference and helped our dev team a lot in attaining better productivity as well as intra-team communication efficiency, and we are looking forward to applying this same approach to our marketing/comm team. We’ve also been reshuffling some of our resources, are reviewing our budget, have started contacting some of the people we identify as key people for the launch, and have started drafting various documents and strategies to ensure that Particl Marketplace’s launch is done properly.</p><h3 id=\"-35-11-did-qiang-tang-work-on-private-listings-for-particl-marketplace\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=35m11s\">35:11</a>) Did Qiang Tang work on private listings for Particl Marketplace?</h3><p>No, this is not part of what they reviewed.</p><h3 id=\"-35-45-how-much-time-would-it-take-the-team-to-release-private-listings-on-testnet\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=35m45s\">35:45</a>) How much time would it take the team to release private listings on testnet?</h3><p>Our team’s goal is to have Particl Marketplace Beta ready by the end of the year, so working back from that point private listings should be released on testnet within that timeframe. Private listings are probably not as critical of a feature as <strong>RingCT</strong> and governance, and while we do want this feature to be part of the mainnet release, it might also make its appearance on testnet after Beta. The marketplace has, however, been designed with this very feature in mind, and the word from our developers is that it should be relatively easy and quick to implement.</p><p>As with everything, Particl is a project with a lot of moving targets and the order and timeframe at which features are released can vary greatly depending on a multitude of factors.</p><h3 id=\"-37-01-if-the-governance-mechanism-and-ringct-work-fine-would-the-marketplace-potentially-be-pushed-to-mainnet-even-though-all-the-items-identified-as-beta-items-aren-t-ready-yet\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=37m1s\">37:01</a>) If the governance mechanism and RingCT work fine, would the marketplace potentially be pushed to mainnet even though all the items identified as Beta items aren’t ready yet?</h3><p>As mentioned above, the two main items required for Beta are the <strong>governance system</strong> and <strong>RingCT</strong>. Other features will also most likely be part of the mainnet release, although it could be debated whether to include them or not at first if they are not ready and we are “in an urge” to release the marketplace.</p><h3 id=\"-38-14-could-we-at-least-have-one-guest-per-ama-faq-livestream-to-show-the-project-from-another-perspective\">(<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VfKSgp5WtJ4?t=38m14s\">38:14</a>) Could we at least have one guest per AMA/FAQ Livestream to show the project from another perspective?</h3><p>Yes, we fully agree. Our developers are very busy with the coding part of the marketplace but it would be great to get more guests from time to time. Some of our best livestreams happened with some of our developers on. It might be possible that for the next livestream we’ll be joined by our <strong>Lead Graphic Designer CRZ</strong>.</p><hr><h2 id=\"news-updates\">News &#x26; Updates</h2><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-1-2-3-released\">Particl Desktop 1.2.3 Released</h3><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673\"><strong>Particl Desktop 1.2.3 Release</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673\"><em>Recently, most of the Particl Desktop application development has been focused on the marketplace, but its wallet…</em></a><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-1-2-3-release-20211242f673\">particl.news</a></p><p>We released on the 12th of September <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/1.2.3\">Particl Desktop 1.2.3</a>, a major update on the <strong>mainnet</strong> wallet capabilities of Particl Desktop.

There are some interesting updates, such as the <strong>RingCT implementation (enhancements)</strong> and the modification currently being done to the governance system. In fact, the development team is <strong>switching the measurement of the voting period duration on community proposals from a block height base to a time base</strong>. It is also possible to see that some of the items related to the Settings tab have been moved over to the Review section.</p><p>You may have noticed that on pretty much every Status Reports, there are mentions of <strong>code refactoring</strong>. Indeed, Particl is leading-edge protocol in terms of technology, and a lot of what’s being accomplished has never been done in the past. While this is most definitely exciting, it is also challenging for our developers as there is very little to compare to or use as a comparative figure. This means that, while they are simultaneously building various pieces of the Particl puzzle, they might, along the way, figure out better, more efficient ways to code some stuff. This is what’s called a <strong>code refactoring</strong>.</p><blockquote>The process of restructuring existing computer code — changing the factoring — without changing its external behavior. Refactoring improves nonfunctional attributes of the software. — <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring\">Wikipedia</a></blockquote><p>You can expect a lot of code refactoring this year as we keep on improving the Particl platform and its infrastructure in order to make as <strong>smooth</strong>, <strong>efficient</strong>, <strong>pleasant to use</strong>, but most importantly, <strong>secure</strong> and <strong>private</strong> as possible.</p><h3 id=\"cold-staking-sneak-peek\">Cold Staking Sneak Peek</h3><blockquote></blockquote><p>We published last Friday a sneak peek of Tecnovert’s <strong>cold staking pool</strong>. While it is still unclear how exactly this pool will be released, once it does it will allow users to delegate their staking powers to a cold staking pool that will have the ability to manage payouts. This means a user with only a few PART coins could receive payouts in smaller increments than a~1.25 PART; Particl’s current staking reward amount. This is a great achievement for our project as that heavily reduces the barrier of entry to staking, meaning no one gets left behind based on monetary values.</p><p>We will have more information about the cold staking pool as we near its launch.</p><h3 id=\"community-proposals-make-their-way-onto-particl-s-testnet\">Community Proposals Make Their Way onto Particl’s Testnet</h3><p>As announced in our last <a href=\"https://particl.news/community-update-6-3ead71971cfe\">Community Update #6</a>, the governance mechanism for the <strong>Community Proposals</strong> as seen its first iteration make its way onto testnet.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
