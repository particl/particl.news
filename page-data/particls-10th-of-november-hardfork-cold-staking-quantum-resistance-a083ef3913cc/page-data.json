Indeed, at 00:00\nUTC, the Particl blockchain will hardfork to bring many critical changes to its\nProof-of-Stake protocol, insuring that its foundation is as strong and secure as\npossible before the long-awaited Particl privacy marketplace is released. The\ntwo main changes to the protocol are the introduction of cold staking and a\ndramatic increase in quantum computer resistance. The hardfork also enables\nprotocol support for staking pools and staking rewards management, meaning that\nwhile they will now be able to be implemented, they will not be present at the\ntime of the fork.\n\nParticl’s 10th of November Hardfork in one imageCold Staking\nThe main feature the hardfork will bring to Particl’s Proof-of-Stake protocol is\nthe ability to securely delegate staking powers to “staking nodes”. The purpose\nof these “staking nodes” is to provide a dedicated resource connected to the\nParticl blockchain and stake on behalf of another wallet without being able to\nspend its coins.\n\nThe reason it is called “cold staking” is because this feature is intended to be\nused in combination with cold/hardware/paper wallets as well as multisig\naddresses, making it possible to stake “offline” coins with no risk of being\nhacked.\n\nStaking nodes can be set up on public/cloud servers, virtual machines or even on\nRPIs. The staking environment theoretically doesn’t even need to be that much\nsecure since these nodes do not contain or cannot be linked to any coin, meaning\nthat you can pretty much stake from anywhere.\n\nIn the future, this feature is likely to become even more relevant when the\nParticl team will start developing the mobile wallet. This wallet is intended to\nhave most or all of the desktop features, but actually staking from a mobile\nphone is far from being ideal. Not only would the network connection be unstable\nat times, it would also use a lot of data as you’d need to constantly download\nevery blocks. With cold staking, you could simply stake your mobile funds from a\nRPI at home or any dedicated server and still get staking revenues from your\nmobile funds without busting the phone bill.\n\nQuantum Resistance\nCurrent Proof-of-Stake implementations have a vulnerability not present in\nProof-of-Work whereby they reveal the public key of staking addresses when they\nfind and sign blocks. The most dangerous attack by quantum computers is against\npublic key cryptography. On traditional computers, it takes on the order of 2128\nbasic operations to get Bitcoin private keys associated with Bitcoin public\nkeys. This number is so massively large that any attack using traditional\ncomputers is completely impractical. However, it is known for sure that it would\ntake a sufficiently large quantum computer on the order of only 1283 basic\nquantum operations to be able to break a Bitcoin key using Shor’s algorithm.\nThis might take some time, especially since the first quantum computers are\nlikely to be extremely slow, but it is still very practical. It could be\nestimated that it is maybe 2 to 5 years until quantum computers become an issue,\nbut any project that plans on staying relevant on a long period of time should\ntackle these vulnerabilities way before they become problematic.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that public keys are NOT public addresses. To reverse a\nprivate key from a public address, it would require more energy than what is\navailable in the universe, therefore a quantum hacker cannot just go pick public\naddresses with large amounts and reverse those.\n\nWhen a Particl block is created, the private key of the address that staked it\nis used to sign the block, effectively broadcasting its public key to the entire\nnetwork. After the hardfork, “staking nodes” that do not contain any coin will\nbe able to sign staked blocks on behalf of any wallet, hot or cold. Even if a\nquantum hacker successfully did reverse the staking node’s private key from its\npublic key, he would not find any coin to steal.\n\nStaking Pools (Protocol Support Only)\nOne very practical use case this hardfork enables is that it enables protocol\nsupport for staking pools. It means this feature will not be available at the\ntime of the fork, but is rendered possible to code due to the changes brought by\nthe hardfork.\n\nIt may not be immediately obvious why staking pools would be useful when you can\nsecurely stake from anywhere, but there are a couple of reasons some users may\nbe drawn towards using them. First of all, staking a low Particl balance may not\nalways be ideal. Since each staking reward is around 1.5 PART and the minimum\nyearly interest is 5%, there could be a lot of time in between staking rewards.\nFor example, if someone wanted to buy $500 worth of Particl priced at 25$, he\nwould end up with 20 PARTs. At 5% inflation rate, that person would earn around\n1 Particl a year, which is even less than a single staking reward.\n\nSimilarly to PoW mining where solo mining Bitcoin with a single GPU card is now\ncompletely impractical, users with small Particl balances could simply delegate\nstaking powers to pools and have them stake their coins on their behalf. As\nmentioned above, this will not be coded at the time of the fork, but it would be\npossible to configure staking nodes to be able to spend staking rewards only (no\naccess to the actual staking funds whatsoever).\n\nA pool operator could simply broadcast its staking node’s public key and have\nusers “connect” and stake from it. Since these nodes could spend the rewards but\nnot the staking funds, the pool operators could simply aggregate staking rewards\ninto their own wallets and make custom payouts (i.e. daily or small 0.05 PART\npayouts).\n\nAnother use-case for staking pools is that the entire process of setting up and\nmaintaining a secure staking node is outsourced to the pool operator. Users\nwould only need to “connect” to the staking pool and not have to worry about\nsetting up their own server/RPI. This is ideal for the less technical users that\nmay eventually end up using Particl.\n\nThe current problem with staking pools is the transaction fees. Since the goal\nis to send smaller than 1.5 PART payouts, there may be a point where sending\nvery small payouts would cost too much in terms of transaction fee. This is an\nissue that could easily be solved with the Lightning Network. Payment channels\ncould be opened between users and the pool wallets and could eventually achieve\nnear-zero transaction costs.\n\nStake To Alternative Address(es) (Protocol Support Only)\nA second powerful but underestimated feature the hardfork adds protocol support\nfor is the ability to fully manage staking rewards. This allows users to select\nwhere the rewards should go and in what percentage. This function will not be\ncoded at the time of the fork, but it will now be possible to do it.\n\nBy default, staking rewards are given to the same address that stake (find and\nsign) a block. With this “alternative address” feature enabled, users would be\nable to automatically have these staking rewards sent to any public addresses\nand in any percentage. This killer feature leverages the amazing power of the\nParticl Proof-of-Stake protocol and enables a brand new way to spend, invest and\ndonate money in a completely passive way. Here are a couple of examples that I\nbelieve could really help the Particl project make a name for itself:\n\n1) Passive donations to crypto influencers\nThis, in my opinion, is a very powerful grassroots marketing strategy. The idea\nis to have crypto public figures such as youtubers or crypto celebs get a\nParticl address and share it. Then any Particl staker can choose the\ninfluencer’s address as a receiver of X% of his staking rewards. If enough\nstakers participate, the aggregated effect could make these passive donations\nquite large. If a crypto youtuber received 500$ worth of Particl everyday for\nsome time, he’s for sure going to look in to the project at one point and the\nother and then maybe start talking about it.\n\n2) Passive funding of community initiatives\nAnother brilliant way to use this potential feature is by creating community\nfunds and bounties. If a community member has an idea for a Particl Dapp,\nwidget, integration or marketing idea he could simply set up a public address\nand have X% of his staking rewards sent to it. If his idea gains traction within\nthe community, other stakers could also start funding the initiative’s address\nand eventually create a sizable bounty to attract contributors. Combined with\nParticl’s decentralized voting, it is an entire decentralized ecosystem that\nenables the users to make things happen and get ideas funded without the need of\nany middleman.\n\n3) Passive donations to organizations\nThis use-case is a bit more philanthropic, but practical nonetheless. Passive\ndonations could be set up to any organization or charity that sets up a Particl\npublic address. These organizations could be, for example, ones that seeks to\nfight for privacy and security like the TOR organization or the EFF. Not only\nwould this help them accomplish their goals, but it would also be a good\nmarketing strategy as many of these organizations display/showcase their big\ndonors.\n\n4) Budgeting & Diversification\nMany addresses could be set up with different purposes and be passively funded\nusing Particl’s Proof-of-Stake protocol. This would make it easier for stakers\nto save or invest money and would be an ideal budgeting strategy. For example, a\nuser could set up a “Vacations Fund”, “Real Estate Downpayment Fund” or a\n“University Fund” and have any percentage of their daily staking rewards sent\nover there. Then, once they would reach their respective funding target, the\nfunds they hold could be traded for fiat and then used to fulfil the goal they\nwere initially created for. Alternatively, this same user could also set up a\n“Bitcoin Investment Fund” or “altcoin Investment Fund” where every week the\nPARTs they hold would be traded for BTCs or other altcoins using a GUI in-wallet\ntoken exchange application (such as Changelly, Shapeshift or flyp.me). This\nwould make it easy for stakers to diversify their holdings into different coins\nwhile at the same time providing exchanges with more liquidity and volume\n\nWhile not implemented yet, this is how Shapeshift would look on the\nParticl walletParticl currently has ~1.5 PART staking rewards and blocks of 2\nminutes, meaning that roughly 1080 PARTs are created everyday. Priced at 7.50$,\nit is worth $8,100 and this daily source of funds will keep growing in value as\nParticl’s price increases. If enough stakers use this feature as a marketing\nstrategy, the aggregated effect it could generate would definitely get people\ntalking. You can only last so long not digging into a project that is funding\nyou hundreds of dollars everyday!\n\nThe hardfork is scheduled for November 10th 2017, 00:00 UTC so make sure you\nupgrade your client to at least version 0.15.2 before that time. You do not need\nto move any wallet file, simply run the client from the updated folder! Since\nthe Particl marketplace will also require a hardfork, it will be interesting to\nobserve how the cold staking hardfork will unfold. At the time of this writing,\n54% of the network has updated, so it seems things should go smoothly.","html":"<p>Particl, a decentralized privacy platform and cryptocurrency, is just about to go through its first hardfork on the 10th of November 2017.

This function will not be coded at the time of the fork, but it will now be possible to do it.</p><p>By default, staking rewards are given to the same address that stake (find and sign) a block. With this “alternative address” feature enabled, users would be able to automatically have these staking rewards sent to any public addresses and in any percentage. This killer feature leverages the amazing power of the Particl Proof-of-Stake protocol and enables a brand new way to spend, invest and donate money in a completely passive way. Here are a couple of examples that I believe could really help the Particl project make a name for itself:</p><p><strong>1) Passive donations to crypto influencers</strong><br>This, in my opinion, is a very powerful grassroots marketing strategy. The idea is to have crypto public figures such as youtubers or crypto celebs get a Particl address and share it. Then any Particl staker can choose the influencer’s address as a receiver of X% of his staking rewards. If enough stakers participate, the aggregated effect could make these passive donations quite large. If a crypto youtuber received 500$ worth of Particl everyday for some time, he’s for sure going to look in to the project at one point and the other and then maybe start talking about it.</p><p><strong>2) Passive funding of community initiatives</strong><br>Another brilliant way to use this potential feature is by creating community funds and bounties. If a community member has an idea for a Particl Dapp, widget, integration or marketing idea he could simply set up a public address and have X% of his staking rewards sent to it. If his idea gains traction within the community, other stakers could also start funding the initiative’s address and eventually create a sizable bounty to attract contributors. Combined with Particl’s decentralized voting, it is an entire decentralized ecosystem that enables the users to make things happen and get ideas funded without the need of any middleman.</p><p><strong>3) Passive donations to organizations</strong><br>This use-case is a bit more philanthropic, but practical nonetheless. Passive donations could be set up to any organization or charity that sets up a Particl public address. These organizations could be, for example, ones that seeks to fight for privacy and security like the TOR organization or the EFF. Not only would this help them accomplish their goals, but it would also be a good marketing strategy as many of these organizations display/showcase their big donors.</p><p><strong>4) Budgeting &#x26; Diversification</strong><br>Many addresses could be set up with different purposes and be passively funded using Particl’s Proof-of-Stake protocol. This would make it easier for stakers to save or invest money and would be an ideal budgeting strategy. For example, a user could set up a “Vacations Fund”, “Real Estate Downpayment Fund” or a “University Fund” and have any percentage of their daily staking rewards sent over there. Then, once they would reach their respective funding target, the funds they hold could be traded for fiat and then used to fulfil the goal they were initially created for. Alternatively, this same user could also set up a “Bitcoin Investment Fund” or “altcoin Investment Fund” where every week the PARTs they hold would be traded for BTCs or other altcoins using a GUI in-wallet token exchange application (such as Changelly, Shapeshift or flyp.me). This would make it easy for stakers to diversify their holdings into different coins while at the same time providing exchanges with more liquidity and volume</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Particl-s-10th-of-November-Hardfork--Cold-Staking---Quantum-Resistance/1-Sxr7V0nzjmfR6nuVTsW3lw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>While not implemented yet, this is how Shapeshift would look on the Particl wallet</figcaption></figure><p>Particl currently has ~1.5 PART staking rewards and blocks of 2 minutes, meaning that roughly 1080 PARTs are created everyday.

This number is so massively large that any attack using traditional computers is completely impractical. However, it is known for sure that it would take a sufficiently large quantum computer on the order of only 1283 basic quantum operations to be able to break a Bitcoin key using Shor’s algorithm. This might take some time, especially since the first quantum computers are likely to be extremely slow, but it is still very practical.

First of all, staking a low Particl balance may not always be ideal.

For example, if someone wanted to buy $500 worth of Particl priced at 25$, he would end up with 20 PARTs.

Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]Following last week's release\nof the MVP for multi-net capabilities using Simplex as the first alternative\nnetwork, we've identified several Simplex-specific issues that we're currently\nworking to resolve.\n\nDue to Simplex's complex and intricate network architecture, these issues are\nproving challenging to address, requiring additional development time.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
