This\naddition makes it easy for users to set up the DEX with Firo using the\ninstaller's graphical interface.\n\nFiro Added to BasicSwap Installer (.exe)The Firo privacy coin has been added to\nBasicSwap’s installer.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/firo-added-to-basicswap-installer-exe/]But we have even more good news about Firo to share today! As mentioned in our\nrecent weekly development updates [https://particl.news/tag/progress/], we've\nbeen working on improving Firo's integration into the DEX. Today, we're thrilled\nto announce that Firo is now fully compatible with bidirectional adaptor\nsignature swaps! \n\nThis marks a significant milestone in our ongoing efforts to improve and expand\nprivacy-first technologies across different chains.\n\nWhat are Bidirectional Adaptor Signature Atomic Swaps?\nHTLC-Based (“Secret Hash”) Swaps vs Adaptor Signature Swaps in\nBasicSwapShedding\nsome light on the distinctions between BasicSwap’s atomic swap technologies\ncurrently available, and their respective privacy and decentralization\nimplications.Particl NewsCangrejo\n[https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/]Adaptor signature atomic swaps\nare an innovative kind of atomic swap, initially conceptualized for Monero to\nfacilitate its atomic swapping with Bitcoin (read more about it here\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n). This new type was necessary because Monero lacks programmable outputs, a key\nfeature needed for the kind of smart contract required to complete its part in\nthe swap process.\n\nAdaptor signature atomic swaps use what's known as \"semi-scriptless scripts.\"\nThis approach allows for a secure swap when only one party has programmable\noutputs (specifically, the other party needs to have SegWit). This breakthrough\nmade Monero <> Bitcoin atomic swaps possible, representing a major step forward\nin the development of decentralized, privacy-first financial technologies.\n\nHowever, the utility of adaptor signatures extends beyond just enabling Monero\ncompatibility. \n\nAnonymous Atomic Swaps\nOne of the key advantages of adaptor signature-based swaps is their inherent\nanonymity. To appreciate this benefit, it's crucial to understand what causes\nthe lack of privacy in standard Hashed TimeLock Contract (HTLC) based atomic\nswaps.\n\nWhy Standard Atomic Swaps are Terrible for Your Privacy\nStandard atomic swaps, while innovative, have significant privacy drawbacks. The\ncore issue arises from the use of an identical hash that is recorded on each\ninvolved blockchain, typically at very close timestamps. Although the hash\nitself doesn't directly disclose any information when singled out, it poses a\nserious privacy threat when cross-referenced against blocks from other\nblockchains. Indeed, blockchain analysis firms can easily detect this identical\nhash on two different blockchains, allowing them to infer that the owners of the\ntwo corresponding addresses have conducted a swap together.\n\nThe situation worsens when the swap involves two transparent coins, such as\nBitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin (LTC), for example. In such cases, the transaction\namounts and the addresses of the participants are fully visible on the\nblockchain, essentially revealing all useful information to passive observers.\nThis level of transparency is akin to smart-contract swaps on platforms like\nEthereum, where the specific details of every swap, including the amounts and\ninvolved parties, are openly visible to anyone.\n\nSuch visibility is a stark contrast to the privacy expectations many users have\nwhen dealing with cryptocurrencies, especially when trading outside of\ncentralized exchanges. It highlights the need for more privacy-preserving\nsolutions, especially for those who value anonymity and confidentiality in their\ntransactions. This is why adaptor signature swaps are so relevant!\n\nSwapping Anonymously Using Adaptor Signature Swaps \nAdaptor signature swaps address the privacy issue inherent in standard HTLC\natomic swaps. When conducting a swap using this newer method, there isn't a\nmatching hash recorded on both blockchains involved in the transaction. This\nmeans the swap-related data remains exclusive to the two participating parties,\neffectively shielding it from external observation.\n\nThis confidentiality ensures that neither passive nor active blockchain tracing\ntechniques can deduce that transactions on two different blockchains are\nconnected. Although one side of the swap — the programmable side, such as\nBitcoin in a BTC <> XMR swap — will still exhibit a multi-signature transaction\non its blockchain, this transaction won't contain any identifiable, traceable\ndata, or even hints that this is specifically a swap transaction. As a result,\nit becomes impossible for anyone to link this transaction to another one on a\ndifferent blockchain.\n\nCan it be Further Improved?\nIn the case of coins paired with Bitcoin and Particl, yes. As part of our\nongoing development for BasicSwap, we're looking forward to integrating Taproot\nfunctionalities into our swap processes. This integration will begin once the\nfinal component of Taproot, known as Tapscripts, is released by the Bitcoin\ndevelopment team.\n\nTaproot is set to significantly enhance transaction privacy and fungibility. It\nachieves this by aggregating multiple signatures in a transaction into a single\none, making the transaction appear typical. Currently, a multi-signature\ntransaction on Bitcoin might still be perceived as non-standard, even though it\ndoesn't reveal extra information to an outside observer. However, once Taproot\nis fully integrated into BasicSwap, such transactions will resemble any other\nregular transaction on the blockchain.\n\nThis update will be a game-changer in ensuring swaps are not just anonymous, but\nalso seamlessly blend in with the regular transaction \"noise\" on the blockchain.\nIt's a crucial step towards achieving the goal of making swaps completely\nanonymous and fungible.\n\nAutomated Market Making on BasicSwap? Yes!\nWhile BasicSwap provides advanced functionality, it is still an early piece of\nsoftware and its liquidity is nascent. \n\nThat's why we've prepared two video tutorials that will help you setup BasicSwap\non a cloud server and automatically provide liquidity to the order book via its\ncompanion automated market making script.\n\nSetup BasicSwap on a VPS\nSetting up BasicSwap on a cloud instance is extremely useful because it won't\nrequire you to keep your computer on at all time and won't cost you storage\nspace on your personal computer. \n\nWhile there is a cost associated with hosting a VPS, our second video, which\nshows how to run automated market making on BasicSwap, may help in offsetting\nthe costs via any potential trading profits.\n\nAutomated Market Making Script\nThis second video tutorial shows you how to deploy BasicSwap's companion\nautomated market making script. This allows you to provide liquidity on the\norder book in a completely automated manner, ensuring that your offers are\nrepublished when they expire.\n\nWhat's more, it also allows you to peg your rates to the current market prices\n(via API price fetching) and add a markup on top of that market rate, netting\nyou profits when people pick up your offers.\n\nCombined with a cloud instance of BasicSwap, this makes running an automated\nBasicSwap node a breeze once the initial setup is complete. You can simply\nlaunch your server, deploy the market making script, and earn profits on your\nprovided liquidity with very minimal manual inputs required.\n\nHow to Swap\nOf course, nothing stops you from picking offers from other swappers if you see\ngreat opportunities. In that case, the tutorial linked below will teach you how\nto go through all the steps required.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn a world increasingly marked by restrictions, censorship, and centralization,\nembracing decentralized and privacy-first platforms like BasicSwap DEX and Firo\nis crucial for reclaiming our digital sovereignty. Each individual's decision to\nuse these platforms plays a significant role in advancing these technologies and\nfostering their wider adoption for the greater good.\n\nIf you are reading this, we want to express our gratitude for your support and\nfor participating in the open-source, privacy-first revolution.

This means <strong>the swap-related data remains exclusive to the two participating parties</strong>, effectively shielding it from external observation.</p><p>This confidentiality ensures that neither passive nor active blockchain tracing techniques can deduce that transactions on two different blockchains are connected.

Our developer, Kewde, gave an insightful\npresentation on the evolution, future, and historical context of atomic swaps,\nwith a particular focus on their application with Monero.\n\nThe presentation is available, in full, on our Youtube channel, and you can\nwatch it here.\n\nWhat we've Achieved Since the Presentation\nSince presenting in June 2023, we achieved significant milestones in our road\ntowards making the DEX more usable, accessible, and feature-complete.\n\nBidirectional Adaptor Signature Atomic Swaps\nBidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) Atomic Swaps Now Live on BasicSwap DEX\nBidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) atomic swaps now live on BasicSwap DEX.\nParticl NewsCangrejo\n[https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\nProbably the most significant achievement since has been the deployment of\nbidirectional adaptor signature atomic swaps, as detailed here\n[https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n.\n\nAdaptor signature swaps were groundbreaking when they were first published\nbecause they enabled atomic swaps between two blockchains, even if only one had\nprogrammable outputs. \n\nThis development was a game-changer, particularly for Monero, as it allowed for\natomic swaps with other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Particl, marking a\nsignificant leap forward in our collective goal of preserving our financial\nprivacy and sovereignty.\n\nHowever, these swaps had a limitation: they were unidirectional. This meant they\ncould only occur when the coin with programmable outputs (i.e., Bitcoin) was the\none being offered. In practical terms, that means Monero couldn't be the coin\noffered in the swap; it could only be received in exchange for another coin like\nBitcoin.\n\nThe introduction of bidirectional adaptor signature atomic swaps by BasicSwap\nDEX is a pivotal contribution to this technology. By utilizing Particl's\nSecureMessaging Network (SMSG), we've developed a method that, from the user's\nperspective, enables the coin without scriptable outputs to be swapped from both\nthe offerer and bidder sides.\n\nFor those interested in a deeper understanding of this significant advancement\nin atomic swap technology, we highly recommend reading this blog post\n[https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/] \non the subject or exploring our DEX Revolution series available here\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n. Additionally, we've published a detailed article here\n[https://particl.news/atomic-swap-style-showdown/] that compares standard HTLC\natomic swaps with adaptor signature-based atomic swaps, providing more insights\ninto the differences between these two atomic swap technologies.\n\nBetter User Interface\nBasicSwap’s GUI 2.0.2 Now AvailableBasicSwap’s new 2.0.2 user interface is now\navailable, featuring a wide range of improvements to the user experience and UI\ncodebase.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswaps-gui-2-0-2-now-available/]We've been\ncontinuously improving BasicSwap's user interface, and we're pleased to share\nthat a major UI/UX update (version 2.1) is on the horizon.\n\nFor those interested in what this update entails, we've provided a detailed\noverview in our weekly development progress update here\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-22-09-2023#user-interface-]\n. We encourage you to head over there to learn more about all the improvements\nand changes that will be part of this upcoming release. \n\nGraphical Installers\nBasicSwap DEX Installer for Windows Released (.exe)The installation wizard\n(.exe) for BasicSwap DEX is now available for Windows users.Particl News\ncryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/basicswap-dex-installer-for-windows-released-exe/]We've\nrecently released a graphical installation wizard for Windows users (.exe) for\nthose looking for an easier approach to setting everything up. This new feature\nnot only simplifies the installation process for Windows users but has also\ndriven a series of back-end improvements.\n\nCurrently, the installation wizard is exclusive to Windows, but we're actively\nworking on extending it to MacOS and Linux users. We aim for a release on these\noperating systems shortly, stay tuned for more any news in that regard published\non Particl News [https://particl.news].\n\nWhat's on the Horizon\nWhile 2023 was focused a lot on the DEX's back-end and developing some of its\ncore features, 2024 is poised to be a pivotal year for BasicSwap as we will\nrelease some of its most significant updates in terms of usability and\naccessibility.\n\nHere are just a few main items we plan on working on. Note that this isn't a\nfully exhaustive list and we are likely to work on other items as well,\nespecially back-end improvements and new functionalities.\n\nLight Nodes / Remote Services\nThis improvement will have substantial benefits for users. In the first place,\nit eliminates the need to download the entire blockchains for each coin, which\ncurrently leads to rather large storage space requirements and lengthy setup\ntimes. Additionally, it will substantially reduce the CPU usage of the DEX,\npotentially by more than 90%.\n\nCurrently, running multiple coin cores simultaneously is a resource-intensive\nprocess and is the primary reason for BasicSwap's high CPU requirements.\nHowever, we want to emphasize that running full nodes provides the highest level\nof security and privacy. Therefore, while we're introducing light nodes and\nremote services as an option to improve usability and reduce resource demands,\nthey will never be mandatory. This approach ensures that users who prioritize\nmaximum security and privacy can continue to run full nodes, while those who\nprefer a quick setup and easy access can also enjoy exactly what they're looking\nfor.\n\nWeb Framework\nAs an extension of our current work on remote services, we plan on building a\nweb framework that will enable users to interact with BasicSwap-related services\ndirectly via the web. This step is particularly important in an era where even\n\"Web3\" technologies are predominantly web-based.\n\nHowever, we're very much aware of the security and privacy challenges that\nhosting a decentralized application (dApp) on the web can pose. Therefore,\nsimilar to our approach with light nodes and remote services, any web-based\nversion of BasicSwap will be entirely optional and we will not transition to a\nweb-only approach. Our goal is to provide both web-based and traditional\noptions, catering to a broad range of user preferences and needs. This is key to\nattracting more users and, consequently, improving the liquidity of the DEX's\norder book which is critical to its success.\n\nThe exact implementation of this web framework is still being determined, and\nthe specifics are subject to change as we progress. Therefore, we cannot yet\ncommit to any sort of official announcement. We will continue to provide regular\nupdates on this development in our weekly progress reports here\n[https://particl.news/tag/progress/].\n\nMore Coins\nWe are committed to adding many more coins moving forward. As our focus lies in\nprivacy, we will naturally focus on privacy coins. However, we also recognize\nthe importance of diversifying our offerings to attract a broader user base. To\nthis end, we plan to include different types of coins and tokens like ETH and\nits various ERC-20 tokens, (e.g., stablecoins), in our lineup.\n\nAgain, attracting a large number of users to BasicSwap is essential as it\ndirectly contributes to increasing the liquidity of the overall ecosystem. This,\nin turn, makes the various currency pairs available on the DEX more liquid and\npractical for trading purposes.\n\nSince our presentation at MoneroKon, our efforts have primarily been focused on\nessential back-end developments, which has limited our capacity to integrate new\ncoins. However, as we move into 2024, we anticipate adding a decent number of\nnew coins and tokens to the DEX.\n\nWe're certainly excited about expanding BasicSwap to other communities and build\nmore bridges between communities! ?\n\nTaproot Integration\nBecause Bitcoin's Taproot update isn't fully complete yet — it still misses the\nSchnorr aggregated signatures — we haven't been able to complete our Taproot\nupdate which will bring massive privacy benefits.\n\nWhile our current adaptor signature swaps do not leave an identical hash on the\nblocks of the two participating blockchains, they do result in a multi-signature\ntransaction on the blockchain of the coin with programmable outputs (for\nexample, Bitcoin in a BTC <> XMR swap). It's important to note that this does\nnot disclose any information about the swap to outside observers. The\ntransaction doesn't reveal itself as a swap; it appears as a standard\nmulti-signature smart contract. However, it still doesn't look like a perfectly\nregular Bitcoin transaction.\n\nThe full integration of Taproot into Bitcoin and Particl pairs using adaptor\nsignature swaps will be a game changer. It will make the multi-signature\ntransaction indistinguishable from regular transactions on the blockchain of the\ncoin with programmable outputs, significantly boosting the fungibility and\nprivacy of BasicSwap-powered swaps done this way.\n\nIt's worth emphasizing that even in their current state, adaptor signature swaps\nare exceptionally private. However, we always strive to improve the privacy of\nour platform in any way we can, and integrating Taproot into our swaps is simply\na logical step forward in pushing the boundaries in the realm of financial\nprivacy and digital sovereignty. \"Hide within the noise\"!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you are reading this, we want to express our gratitude for your support and\nfor participating in the open-source, privacy-first revolution — your\ninvolvement is a valuable contribution to this movement. \n\nThank you for being a part of this journey towards a more secure, private, and\ndecentralized digital future.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

This new feature not only simplifies the installation process for Windows users but has also driven a series of back-end improvements.</p><p>Currently, the installation wizard is exclusive to Windows, but we're actively working on extending it to MacOS and Linux users. We aim for a release on these operating systems shortly, stay tuned for more any news in that regard published on <a href=\"https://particl.news\">Particl News</a>.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-on-the-horizon\">What's on the Horizon</h2><p>While 2023 was focused a lot on the DEX's back-end and developing some of its core features, 2024 is poised to be a pivotal year for BasicSwap as we will release some of its most significant updates in terms of usability and accessibility.</p><p>Here are just a few main items we plan on working on. Note that this isn't a fully exhaustive list and we are likely to work on other items as well, especially back-end improvements and new functionalities.</p><h3 id=\"light-nodes-remote-services\">Light Nodes / Remote Services</h3><p>This improvement will have substantial benefits for users. In the first place, it eliminates the need to download the entire blockchains for each coin, which currently leads to rather large storage space requirements and lengthy setup times. Additionally, it will substantially reduce the CPU usage of the DEX, potentially by more than 90%.</p><p>Currently, running multiple coin cores simultaneously is a resource-intensive process and is the primary reason for BasicSwap's high CPU requirements. However, we want to emphasize that running full nodes provides the highest level of security and privacy. Therefore, while we're introducing light nodes and remote services as an option to improve usability and reduce resource demands, they will never be mandatory. This approach ensures that users who prioritize maximum security and privacy can continue to run full nodes, while those who prefer a quick setup and easy access can also enjoy exactly what they're looking for.</p><h3 id=\"web-framework\">Web Framework</h3><p>As an extension of our current work on remote services, we plan on building a web framework that will enable users to interact with BasicSwap-related services directly via the web. This step is particularly important in an era where even \"Web3\" technologies are predominantly web-based.</p><p>However, we're very much aware of the security and privacy challenges that hosting a decentralized application (dApp) on the web can pose. Therefore, similar to our approach with light nodes and remote services, any web-based version of BasicSwap will be entirely optional and we will not transition to a web-only approach. Our goal is to provide both web-based and traditional options, catering to a broad range of user preferences and needs. This is key to attracting more users and, consequently, improving the liquidity of the DEX's order book which is critical to its success.</p><p>The exact implementation of this web framework is still being determined, and the specifics are subject to change as we progress. Therefore, we cannot yet commit to any sort of official announcement. We will continue to provide regular updates on this development in our weekly progress reports <a href=\"https://particl.news/tag/progress/\"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"more-coins\">More Coins</h3><p>We are committed to adding many more coins moving forward. As our focus lies in privacy, we will naturally focus on privacy coins. However, we also recognize the importance of diversifying our offerings to attract a broader user base. To this end, we plan to include different types of coins and tokens like ETH and its various ERC-20 tokens, (e.g., stablecoins), in our lineup.</p><p>Again, attracting a large number of users to BasicSwap is essential as it directly contributes to increasing the liquidity of the overall ecosystem. This, in turn, makes the various currency pairs available on the DEX more liquid and practical for trading purposes.</p><p>Since our presentation at MoneroKon, our efforts have primarily been focused on essential back-end developments, which has limited our capacity to integrate new coins. However, as we move into 2024, we anticipate adding a decent number of new coins and tokens to the DEX.</p><p>We're certainly excited about expanding BasicSwap to other communities and build more bridges between communities! ?</p><h3 id=\"taproot-integration\">Taproot Integration</h3><p>Because Bitcoin's Taproot update isn't fully complete yet — it still misses the Schnorr aggregated signatures — we haven't been able to complete our Taproot update which will bring massive privacy benefits.</p><p>While our current adaptor signature swaps do not leave an identical hash on the blocks of the two participating blockchains, they do result in a multi-signature transaction on the blockchain of the coin with programmable outputs (for example, Bitcoin in a BTC &#x3C;> XMR swap). It's important to note that this does not disclose any information about the swap to outside observers. The transaction doesn't reveal itself as a swap; it appears as a standard multi-signature smart contract. However, it still doesn't look like a perfectly regular Bitcoin transaction.</p><p>The full integration of Taproot into Bitcoin and Particl pairs using adaptor signature swaps will be a game changer. It will make the multi-signature transaction indistinguishable from regular transactions on the blockchain of the coin with programmable outputs, significantly boosting the fungibility and privacy of BasicSwap-powered swaps done this way.</p><p>It's worth emphasizing that even in their current state, adaptor signature swaps are exceptionally private. However, we always strive to improve the privacy of our platform in any way we can, and integrating Taproot into our swaps is simply a logical step forward in pushing the boundaries in the realm of financial privacy and digital sovereignty. \"Hide within the noise\"!</p><hr><p>If you are reading this, we want to express our gratitude for your support and for participating in the open-source, privacy-first revolution — your involvement is a valuable contribution to this movement. </p><p>Thank you for being a part of this journey towards a more secure, private, and decentralized digital future.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">The Open-Source Revolution</h3><p>We're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital economy that is fair and open to all.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
