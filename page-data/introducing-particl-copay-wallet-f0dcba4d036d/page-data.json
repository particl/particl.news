Development Team released the latest version of the Particl Core\nwallet: Release 0.15.0.2\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.15.0.2]\n\n * Linux Versions— aarch64, arm, i686, x86_64\n * OSX Version — osx64\n * Windows Versions — win32, win64\n * Open Source code + checksums\n\nThis merges the latest development on Bitcoin Core 0.15.0.1 which was a\nconsidered a major release. Release notes for Particl Core 0.15.0.2 can be found \nhere\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.15.0.2.md]\n.\n\nHard Fork — Nov 10th\nParticl Core 0.15.0.2 will activate a hard fork on the 10th November 2017. The\nHark Fork will activate the Cold Staking Protocol (OP_ISCOINSTAKE) on the\nParticl blockchain.\n\nCold Staking Protocol support\nParticl Core will support cold staking once the Hard Fork activates on Nov 10th.\nCold Staking OP_ISCOINSTAKE introduces a new opcode and transaction type.\n\nThe new opcode OP_ISCOINSTAKE returns true if the transaction is a coinstake.\n\nWhen used in a script it allows the output to be spent by one script when the\nspending transaction is a coinstake and another if not.\n\n> Example: OP_ISCOINSTAKE OP_IF <coinstake_txn_script> OP_ELSE <spend_txn_script>\nOP_ENDIF\n<spend_txn_script> can be any supported script including paytoscripthash\n\nThe script below allows signing with the key to idA only when in a coinstake\ntxn:\n\nOP_ISCOINSTAKE OP_IF\nOP_DUP OP_HASH160 <idA> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG\nOP_ELSE\nOP_DUP OP_HASH160 <idB> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG\nOP_ENDIF\n\nA constraint is placed on coinstake transactions using inputs with scripts using\nOP_ISCOINSTAKE such that the outputs must pay at least the same amount as the\ninputs to the same script used in the input outputs.\n\nThis prevents coin from being moved from outputs with scripts using\nOP_ISCOINSTAKE without being able to sign for <spend_txn_script>\n\nMulti-wallet support\nParticl Core now supports loading multiple, separate wallets (See PR 8694\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8694], PR 10849\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10849]). The wallets are completely\nseparated, with individual balances, keys and received transactions.\n\nMulti-wallet is enabled by using more than one -wallet argument when starting\nParticl, either on the command line or in the Particl config file.\n\nIn particl-Qt, only the first wallet will be displayed and accessible for\ncreating and signing transactions. GUI selectable multiple wallets will be\nsupported in a future version. However, even in 0.15 other loaded wallets will\nremain synchronized to the node’s current tip in the background. This can be\nuseful if running a pruned node, since loading a wallet where the most recent\nsync is beyond the pruned height results in having to download and revalidate\nthe whole blockchain. Continuing to synchronize all wallets in the background\navoids this problem.\n\nMempool Persistence Across Restarts\nVersion 0.14 introduced mempool persistence across restarts (the mempool is\nsaved to a mempool.dat file in the data directory prior to shutdown and restores\nthe mempool when the node is restarted). Version 0.15 allows this feature to be\nswitched on or off using the -persistmempool command-line option (See PR 9966\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9966]). By default, the option is set\nto true, and the mempool is saved on shutdown and reloaded on startup.

Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]Following last week's release\nof the MVP for multi-net capabilities using Simplex as the first alternative\nnetwork, we've identified several Simplex-specific issues that we're currently\nworking to resolve.\n\nDue to Simplex's complex and intricate network architecture, these issues are\nproving challenging to address, requiring additional development time.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
