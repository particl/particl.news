To that end, the Particl community forum\n[https://particl.community/] is the perfect place for focused discussions and to\nget to know what others have observed.\n\nTo help to streamline community testing for Particl V3-testnet, the community\nhas prepared a Marketplace Testing category to the forum where you can report\nissues to other community members and see what others are coming up with. Simply\nfollow this link [https://particl.community/category/16/marketplace-testing] to\nland in the right place.\n\nStill, if you find any observation that has found a certain degree of consensus,\nyou are kindly asked to formally publish it on the Github Issues\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] page. This way, it is\nguaranteed that the developers won’t miss it.\n\nNotes\nIf you encounter problems connecting to peers, it may be caused by the low\nnumber of nodes on the testnet network. To fix this issue, open up your Particl\nDesktop debug console and type the following command to connect to a seeding\nnode:\naddnode \"212.47.250.16:51938\" \"add\"\n\nIf you spot any issue, bug, or area of improvement, please report it directly on\nthe Github Issues [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] page.\n\nYour wallet needs to be unlocked to process buy and sell orders on the\nmarketplace.\n\nParticl Marketplace is still in on-going development, and thus, is considered to\nbe a Beta release.\n\n> Note: The source code linked to here is not the actual tagged release source\ncode. Please contact the Particl team for source code information. The actual\nsource code will be uploaded and made available after an appropriate interval of\ntime has passed.\nAdvanced Start-up\nSometimes it's helpful to start the application from the terminal, aka command\nline. It gives you additional information about what's happening in the\nbackground.\n\nWindows\n 1. Open \"Windows Explorer\"\n 2. On the installation folder (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\Particl Desktop\n    Testnet\\Particl Desktop Testnet\") Press [SHIFT⇧]+[MOUSE-RIGHT◳] and choose\n    \"Open command window here\"\n 3. Type the following command including the quotation marks into the terminal\n    and hit [ENTER ↵] \"Particl Desktop Testnet.exe\"\n\nMac\n 1. Open \"Terminal\" \n    (e.g. [COMMAND ⌘] + [SPACE] and type terminal > hit [ENTER ↵])\n 2. Type in this command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    /Applications/Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet.app/Contents/MacOS/Particl\\ Desktop\\\n    Testnet\n\nLinux\n 1. Open a terminal in the folder where you’ve installed the application and\n    type the following command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    ./Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet\n\nChangelog\nWhat follows is a list of changes, bug fixes, and improvements made to Particl\nV3 since its first testnet release. This list is not exhaustive, it does not\ninclude some of the smaller and/or less impactful fixes.\n\n[Governance module] Introduces a new governance module that allows for viewing\nactive and upcoming CCS proposals that require a network vote, as well as past\nproposals. Voting on a current or future proposal is currently available,\nalthough not enabled when using a cold staking wallet (the vote should rather be\ncast on the cold staking node). Further, detailed information on the proposals\nand how to vote is included in the module. While the governance module is\nincluded in this release, it has been temporarily disabled - this is not a bug\n\n[Market module] Removes the unused and invalid publishing controls in the\nproduct import wizard.\n\n[Market module] Images are displayed alongside the market name, if available, in\nadditional places in the product creation and publishing areas.\n\n[Market module] Removes the display of a 'ROOT' parent category that was\ndisplayed on items in the cart.\n\n[Market module] Replaces usage of the word 'bid' with 'order request' and\n'order' where appropriate, to avoid confusion ('bid' terminology is confusing,\nwith 'order request' more accurately aligning with the behaviour).\n\n[Market module] Fixes an error in the GUI preventing the joining of a market\nunder certain circumstances.\n\n[Market module] When a listing item is flagged, all exact duplicates of the\nlisting item in the same market are now flagged as well. When a new duplicate of\nan already flagged item is received for the same market, it will be flagged as\nwell.\n\n[Market module] Fixes a case in the Listing Details where action buttons were\nnot disabling correctly when another action is being processed and taking some\ntime to complete.\n\n[Market module] Adds the ability to export to CSV a list of sell orders. The\nsell orders exported are those currently displayed; sell orders exported are\ninfluenced by any search and filtering criteria applied).\n\n[Market module] Fixes an issue preventing publishing items to a market with a 0\nvalue for either of the shipping prices.\n\n[Market module] Fixes an error whereby the wrong favorite item may be removed\nwhile attempting to remove a favorite item.\n\n[Market module] Reduces the number of stealth addresses used per wallet/identity\nthroughout the marketplace.\n\n[Market module] Adds additional validation to market message order sequencing.\n\n[Wallet module] Prevents the user from navigating to another app/module in\ncertain steps of the wallet creation: this prevents issues with potentially\nusing an uninitialized wallet in other app/module (i.e., the Governance module).\n\n[General] Fixes the zmq.node error on some versions of Windows that prevented\nthe application from opening.\n\n[General] Attempts a fix at a possible intermittent issue where the connection\nevent may not be properly processed and thus the application fails to start\ncorrectly. Further testing and feedback may be necessary.\n\n[General] Display a random \"message of the day\" on the welcome screen. The\ncurrent number of messages is limited, but can be added to in the future.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf this testing round goes well and no other major issue is identified in the\nnext couple of days, Particl V3 will be ready for mainnet very shortly. We will\nclearly communicate the mainnet release date on Particl News\n[https://particl.news/] and within the usual communications channels.\n\nSo let's get testing and keep an eye out for the confirmation on the release\ndate very soon!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This list is not exhaustive, it does not include some of the smaller and/or less impactful fixes.</p><p><strong>[Governance module]</strong> Introduces a new governance module that allows for viewing active and upcoming CCS proposals that require a network vote, as well as past proposals. Voting on a current or future proposal is currently available, although not enabled when using a cold staking wallet (the vote should rather be cast on the cold staking node). Further, detailed information on the proposals and how to vote is included in the module. <strong>While the governance module is included in this release, it has been temporarily disabled - this is not a bug</strong></p><p><strong>[Market module]</strong> Removes the unused and invalid publishing controls in the product import wizard.</p><p><strong>[Market module]</strong> Images are displayed alongside the market name, if available, in additional places in the product creation and publishing areas.</p><p><strong>[Market module]</strong> Removes the display of a 'ROOT' parent category that was displayed on items in the cart.</p><p><strong>[Market module]</strong> Replaces usage of the word 'bid' with 'order request' and 'order' where appropriate, to avoid confusion ('bid' terminology is confusing, with 'order request' more accurately aligning with the behaviour).</p><p><strong>[Market module]</strong> Fixes an error in the GUI preventing the joining of a market under certain circumstances.</p><p><strong>[Market module]</strong> When a listing item is flagged, all exact duplicates of the listing item in the same market are now flagged as well. When a new duplicate of an already flagged item is received for the same market, it will be flagged as well.</p><p><strong>[Market module]</strong> Fixes a case in the Listing Details where action buttons were not disabling correctly when another action is being processed and taking some time to complete.</p><p><strong>[Market module]</strong> Adds the ability to export to CSV a list of sell orders. The sell orders exported are those currently displayed; sell orders exported are influenced by any search and filtering criteria applied).</p><p><strong>[Market module]</strong> Fixes an issue preventing publishing items to a market with a 0 value for either of the shipping prices.</p><p><strong>[Market module]</strong> Fixes an error whereby the wrong favorite item may be removed while attempting to remove a favorite item.</p><p><strong>[Market module]</strong> Reduces the number of stealth addresses used per wallet/identity throughout the marketplace.</p><p><strong>[Market module]</strong> Adds additional validation to market message order sequencing.</p><p><strong>[Wallet module]</strong> Prevents the user from navigating to another app/module in certain steps of the wallet creation: this prevents issues with potentially using an uninitialized wallet in other app/module (i.e., the Governance module).</p><p><strong>[General]</strong> Fixes the zmq.node error on some versions of Windows that prevented the application from opening.</p><p><strong>[General]</strong> Attempts a fix at a possible intermittent issue where the connection event may not be properly processed and thus the application fails to start correctly. Further testing and feedback may be necessary.</p><p><strong>[General]</strong> Display a random \"message of the day\" on the welcome screen. The current number of messages is limited, but can be added to in the future.</p><hr><p>If this testing round goes well and no other major issue is identified in the next couple of days, Particl V3 will be ready for mainnet very shortly.

Particl V3 progress report\nwe’d like to share with you.\n\nAs one would expect from our last Particl V3 progress report\n[https://particl.news/particl-v3-progress-report-09-07-2021/] and the subsequent \n testnet release of Particl V3\n[https://particl.news/new-particl-v3-testnet-available/] earlier this week, the\ndevelopers have been mostly focused on identifying, collecting from community\ntesters, and fixing new issues with Particl V3.\n\nAdditionally, as the team is finalizing the post-V3 roadmap, a lot work has also\ngone into research for new features, functionalities, and deliverables that are\nplanned to be part of it. This includes, but isn’t limited to, the initial\nplanning of an SMSG Manager to provide the basis for a unified SMSG processing\nsection for various app/modules (and prepare for the upcoming migration to SMSG\n2.0 later on), a further separation of Particl Desktop and Particl Core, and\nvarious other items.\n\nTo be noted, you can expect the next couple of weeks to be more heavily\nresearch-focused than usual. That’s because the upcoming mainnet release crosses\na lot of items from the current roadmap. As Particl jumps into the next phase of\nits development cycle, a lot of the new, more sizeable roadmap items require\nproper research into their feasibility, security, privacy, decentralization, and\nother various implications.\n\nWith all of the above said, let's get down to the progress report.\n\n> Note: Some items that were present in the last progress report are not included\nin this one. In all cases, that’s because they have been successfully completed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn Progress\nAny New Particl V3 Bug\nAny reported bug from the new Particl V3 testnet build will get immediate\npriority to ensure the client is stable and ready for mainnet release as fast as\npossible.\n\nIf you encounter any issue while testing Particl V3, please report it to the\nGithub Issue page of the particl-desktop repository. This page is located here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues].\n\nResearch and Experimentation Related to Potential Post-V3 Roadmap Items\nVarious research and experimentation related to post-V3 roadmap items have\nbegun. This is expected to last for a few weeks as the team is finalizing its\npost-V3 roadmap, establishing priorities, and so on. We will publicly release\nthe roadmap and the team's vision, goals, and objectives for the foreseeable\nfuture very soon.\n\nStay tune as we’ll push everything, as per usual, through Particl News and our\ntypical communications channels.\n\nTo Be Completed Next\nMainnet Release of Particl V3\nParticl V3 is currently going through what is expected to be its final testnet\nround. A few minor issues have been picked up so far by the community, but it\nstill doesn’t appear, at this time, like a new testnet round will be required.\nThank you all for your precious help!\n\nStill, we want to reiterate our call for help to all Windows 10 users who\ncouldn’t run previous Particl V3 testnet builds. While the issue appears to have\nbeen fixed, we’d like to gather as much feedback as possible from you to ensure\nthat the build works fine over as many different environments as possible.\n\nAs we are lining everything up for Particl V3 to go live on mainnet, we will\nvery soon announce its exact release date. Keep an eye on Particl News\n[https://particl.news/] and other communications channel; the date will be\nclearly announced in advance so that everybody has the time to prepare and\nspread the word.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCan you feel it? After months of hard work, Particl V3 is finally ready to be\nunleashed to the world. And it can’t come at a better time; the world\nincreasingly realizes that it needs it, and that feeling will only get stronger\nas time passes by.\n\nAs a final word for this update, we’d like to mention that if you plan on\nselling stuff on Particl Marketplace, then we encourage you to download the CSV\nInventory File template using the current testnet build by navigating to the\nSELL / Inventory & Products / Import / CSV File section of Particl Desktop.\nThat’ll allow you to prepare your listings before the mainnet release so that\nyou can get down to business in lightning-fast fashion.\n\nThanks for the tremendous support throughout the entire development cycle of\nParticl V3. It can be hard, at times, to quantify the impact of supporting\nwords, but it’s been of great help to all team members and makes all the blood,\nsweat, and tears that was put into it worth more than anything in the world.\nLet’s change the world for the better, together!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This marks yet another significant milestone for the project as this\nfunds the team to develop, promote, and expand the Particl ecosystem once more.\n\nLet’s break down the numbers and go through the implications of this funding\nproposal moving forward.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Results Are In!\nTeam Funding Request\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/team-funding-request-1.html]The Team Funding\nRequest #1 suggested attributing funds from the Treasury Fund to the Particl\nteam to support the development, promotion, and expansion of the Particl\necosystem. The proposal requested 35,250 PART per month from the treasury for 6\nmonths, after which a new funding request will need to be pushed by the team and\napproved by stakeholders.\n\nWe are happy to report that Particl stakeholders have approved this proposal \nwith a solid 98.6% approval rate (minimum required was 60%) and a 64%\nparticipation rate (minimum required was 20%). The vote lasted for 5,040 blocks,\nwith 3,191 of them voting in favor of the proposal and 46 voting against it.\n\nWhen Will the Team Start Claiming Funds\nWith the funding request now approved, the team can now claim funds from the\ntreasury according to its stated schedule. However, because the new treasury\nmodel has just gone live today (read the Hardfork Successful\n[https://particl.news/july-2021-hardfork-successful/] blog post for more\ndetails), which is in the middle of July, the team will only start claiming\nfunds at the end of August. That means that the first month out of the six\nrequested by the team’s funding request will be August. The proposal then\nexpires after the month of January 2022, which is the last month out of the six\nwhere the Particl team will claim funds. A new funding request will then be\npublished and will need to be approved by Particl stakeholders.\n\nIn the meantime, the team will use the remaining days of July to finalize the\ndeployment of the new legal entity, finish up the new website, and get\neverything ready for August and onward. Within that period, the team will also\nprepare the new roadmap for public release and explain, in detail, the reasoning\nbehind it and the objectives that motivate it. Spoiler alert, it is simply\namazing, and we can’t wait to share it with you all!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank You For Your Trust\nThis particular proposal was the first-ever funding request for the new treasury\nmodel. Because the community entirely owns the treasury’s fund, this proposal\nasked for much more than just coins to support the project; it asked for the\ncommunity’s trust and stamp of approval.\n\nWith this in mind, we want to thank every one of you in the community for this\nvote of confidence and for participating in this democratic exercise. We are all\nvery excited to move past the mainnet release of Particl V3 and get down to some\nserious business!\n\nLet’s take Particl to the literal next level and deliver to the world a truly\ndecentralized, private, secure, and free e-commerce platform that is easy to\nuse. It’s high time that we all break free from the chains of greedy\ncorporations and agenda-driven organizations that have centralized control and\npower both on the internet and offline.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]Following last week's release\nof the MVP for multi-net capabilities using Simplex as the first alternative\nnetwork, we've identified several Simplex-specific issues that we're currently\nworking to resolve.\n\nDue to Simplex's complex and intricate network architecture, these issues are\nproving challenging to address, requiring additional development time.

SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
