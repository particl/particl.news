These are the output claim management proposal and the one to enable\na brand new, powerful treasury model.\n\nThat’s directly in line with our recent efforts to put more focus on community\ngovernance and improve the degree of decentralization of the project. This now\nputs you in a much more influential position.\n\nToday, we are thrilled to reveal all the details and parameters of this on-chain\nand entirely decentralized voting mechanism.\n\nLet’s jump right in!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Contents\n * CCS Proposals\n * On-Chain Voting\n * Approval Rates, Quorum, Duration, and Consensus\n   [/on-chain-voting-and-ccs-proposals/approval-rates-quorum-duration-and-consensus]\n * Potential Voting Outcomes\n * Proposal Lifecycle\n * Community Fund\n * First Proposal Coming in on Wednesday\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCCS Proposals\nAs explained, in detail, in the introductory blog post of the CCS\n[https://particl.news/new-community-crowdfunding-system-f31f54231982/], anyone\ncan submit proposals on the CCS to request donations for initiatives from the\ncommunity. The introduction of the CCS was the first step in improving the level\nof decentralization and put in place a solid governance mechanism. The on-chain\nvoting system, which is now integrated into the CCS, is the next step to that\nmission.\n\nOn-Chain Voting\nThe on-chain network voting system is an additional governance tool that you can\nnow use to let your voice be heard. Any CCS proposal can now request a network\nvote to determine consensus. The most common use for network votes will be for\nproposals requesting initiatives to be funded from the Community Fund, but can\nbe used for other purposes as well. That's all up to the proposal owner!\n\nThe voting system works using staking weight, meaning that you register a vote\nevery time you stake a block on the network. This ensures that only those with a\nstake or interest in the project can vote, preventing outside influence from\naffecting the votes unjustly. It also encourages more people to stake their\ncoins to vote, which increases the network’s security and performance at the\nsame time.\n\nThe main benefit of on-chain voting compared to the legacy, SMSG-based voting\nsystem that was present in Particl Desktop is auditability and provability. With\nthis system, all votes, and their tallied results, are permanently written on\nthe blockchain, and results can provably be observed at any later time without\nany risk of tampering.\n\nIt's important to mention that staking pools, whose staking weight is made up of\nall the coins staked on the pool, also possess the power to vote. The more coins\na pool contains, the more voting power it has.\n\n> Note: For a vote to be counted, you need to successfully stake a block within\nthe voting period. If you own a small balance of PART (< 1,000 PART), it is\nlikely that you don’t stake a block every week and thus, won’t register a vote.\nApproval Rates, Quorum, Duration, and Consensus\n\nFor a proposal’s voting process to be considered valid, there are three\nrequirements to fill. They are the quorum requirement, the approval rate, and\nthe minimum duration of the voting process. The quorum requirement is determined\nby what percentage of the blocks within a given voting process cast a vote. The\napproval rate is defined by the percentage of the votes cast being in favor of a\nproposal.\n\nProposals that require a vote are separated into two different categories, each\none with its own value requirements.\n\nNon Protocol Consensus Votes\n * Quorum: 20% of blocks during the voting period\n * Approval rate: >= 60% in favor\n * Duration: 5,040 blocks minimum\n\nNon protocol consensus votes are proposals that do not require a major change in\nthe protocol to be made. Typically, they would be proposals claiming funds from\nthe Community Fund, for example, or determining the direction of a particular\ninitiative.\n\nFor a non protocol consensus vote to be considered valid, its voting period must\nbe a minimum of 5,040 blocks (roughly one week). Within that period, 20% of the\nblocks staked need to cast a vote for one of the available voting options. That\nmeans the quorum has to be at least 20%. Finally, to be considered as approved\nby the community, it needs to reach an approval rate of at least 60%, meaning at\nleast 60% of all the votes cast for the proposal are in favor of the proposed\nidea.\n\nProtocol Consensus Votes\n * Quorum: 20% of blocks during the voting period\n * Approval rate: >= 75% in favor\n * Duration: 10,080 blocks minimum\n\nProtocol consensus votes are a bit more important in scope and can have a more\nsignificant impact on the ecosystem. They are any proposal that requires a\nspecific change in the protocol, such as, for example, integrating a\ndecentralized treasury model, modifying the inflation rate of the blockchain,\nintroducing a new privacy technology, etc.\n\nJust like non protocol consensus votes, their quorum requirement stands at 20%.\nBut because of their increased level of importance and ramifications, they\nrequire a higher level of approval from the community. In fact, the required \napproval rate has to be at least 75%. Finally, the duration of any protocol\nconsensus vote has to be a minimum of 10,080 blocks (roughly two weeks) to give\nample time to anyone to be able to cast their vote.\n\nPotential Voting Outcomes\nThere are a few possible scenarios to a vote. Here they are with their\nrespective outcome.\n\n * If quorum is not met, the proposal is REJECTED ❌\n * If the quorum is met but the votes fail to meet the target approval rate, the\n   proposal is REJECTED ❌\n * If the quorum is met and the votes reach the approval rate (“Yes”), the\n   proposal is APPROVED ✅\n * If a voting round reaches its expiration before reaching quorum or the target\n   approval rate, the proposal expires and is REJECTED ❌\n\nProposal Lifecycle\nBelow is the basic process for submitting and evaluating proposals that require\na vote.\n\n * A proposal is submitted on the CCS. Click here\n   [https://ccs.particl.io/how-to-ccs/] to see how to submit your own proposal.\n * The proposal owner indicates, in the header, whether the proposal requires a\n   vote or not.\n * The proposal is reviewed by the CCS administrators and then published.\n * Valid proposals are open for discussion for a minimum of one week but voting\n   does not begin immediately. The proposal can be edited by its owner in\n   response to community feedback.\n * If a proposal becomes clearly inactive (proposal owner stops commenting on\n   the proposal or does not authorize the start of voting), a CCS administrator\n   may mark the proposal as “Abandoned”. Abandoned proposals are publicly\n   viewable, but cannot be edited, commented on, or be authorized to vote. A CCS\n   administrator can mark a proposal as abandoned at any time before the\n   proposal owner authorizes voting. Once the proposal owner authorizes voting\n   on a proposal, it cannot be abandoned unless the proposal owner revokes\n   voting on the proposal.\n * The proposal owner authorizes voting to start. A CCS administrator will then\n   assign a voting block interval to it (duration of the voting period).\n * The voting period begins for the number of blocks assigned by the\n   administrator. For example, one week is around 5,040 blocks.\n * When the voting period ends, the proposal is formally approved or rejected.\n   This depends on if the quorum and the approval rate are met.\n * When a proposal with a budget and deliverables is approved, work can begin.\n   The proposal owner can submit claims for funds upon completion of the\n   milestone deliverables that are pre-defined within the proposal.\n\nCommunity Fund\nInsightParticl Insight. View detailed information on all particl transactions\nand blocks.\n[https://explorer.particl.io/address/RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM]If you\nhave a great project or business you wish to build on Particl, or if there’s a\nservice you want to provide to the ecosystem, you may require funds to make it\nhappen. Ever since the initial release of the CCS, the only way to get that\nfunding was through community donations.\n\nWith the on-chain voting system, you will soon be able to claim funds from the \nCommunity Fund\n[https://explorer.particl.io/address/RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM] to help\nyou realize your initiative. And because this Community Fund belongs to all PART\nholders, it needs their approval to draw funds from it.\n\nIndeed, to incentivize more use of the CCS system by the community, the team is\ngoing to open up the Community Fund. All you’ll need to do to claim the funds is\ncraft a clear proposal that requires a vote and explains your initiative in\ndetail as well as why you need the funds. Then, you need to convince the Particl\ncommunity to vote in favor of your proposal and approve the claim of funds.\n\nFirst Proposal Coming in on Wednesday!\nYou won’t have to wait for too long to put on your first vote! As soon as this \nWednesday (28th of April, 2021), we will publish the first-ever proposal to\nrequire the use of the on-chain voting system.\n\nThis proposal, which was widely requested by the community, seeks to nominate\nthe Particl team as managers of the manual claim process required to unfreeze\nall legitimate anon and blind coins. These coins are currently frozen as part of\nthe emergency hardfork deployed by the team weeks ago and they need to be\nre-enabled as smoothly as possible. Keep an eye out on Particl News and the CCS\non Wednesday for all the details on the proposal!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith the support of the on-chain voting system as well as the upcoming few\nproposals, the Particl project is entering a brand new phase that emphasizes the\npower of the community much more. If you’ve ever had a great idea for a project,\nbusiness, or service you think would benefit the Particl ecosystem, you’ll have\nall the tools you need to make it happen, if you can convince the community!\n\nThis addition to the CCS marks a significant milestone for the project and\nshould lead to many more community contributions than we’ve ever seen. Don’t\nforget, if the decentralized treasury model proposal is approved, the Community\nFund is also going to grow in value and, if the price of PART increases, will\ngrow exponentially in value, opening even more doors. This has tremendous\npotential and we can’t wait to see what you, the community, will create with\nthese resources!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

The introduction of the CCS was the first step in improving the level of decentralization and put in place a solid governance mechanism. The on-chain voting system, which is now integrated into the CCS, is the next step to that mission.</p><h1 id=\"on-chain-voting\">On-Chain Voting</h1><p>The on-chain network voting system is an additional governance tool that you can now use to let your voice be heard. Any CCS proposal can now request a network vote to determine consensus. The most common use for network votes will be for proposals requesting initiatives to be funded from the Community Fund, but can be used for other purposes as well. That's all up to the proposal owner!</p><p>The voting system works using staking weight, meaning that you register a vote every time you stake a block on the network. This ensures that only those with a stake or interest in the project can vote, preventing outside influence from affecting the votes unjustly. It also encourages more people to stake their coins to vote, which increases the network’s security and performance at the same time.</p><p>The main benefit of on-chain voting compared to the legacy, SMSG-based voting system that was present in Particl Desktop is auditability and provability. With this system, all votes, and their tallied results, are permanently written on the blockchain, and results can provably be observed at any later time without any risk of tampering.</p><p>It's important to mention that staking pools, whose staking weight is made up of all the coins staked on the pool, also possess the power to vote. The more coins a pool contains, the more voting power it has.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> For a vote to be counted, you need to successfully stake a block within the voting period. If you own a small balance of PART (&#x3C; 1,000 PART), it is likely that you don’t stake a block every week and thus, won’t register a vote.</em></blockquote><h1 id=\"approval-rates-quorum-duration-and-consensus\">Approval Rates, Quorum, Duration, and Consensus</h1><p><br>For a proposal’s voting process to be considered valid, there are three requirements to fill. They are the <strong>quorum requirement</strong>, the <strong>approval rate</strong>, and the <strong>minimum duration of the voting process</strong>. The quorum requirement is determined by what percentage of the blocks within a given voting process cast a vote. The approval rate is defined by the percentage of the votes cast being in favor of a proposal.</p><p>Proposals that require a vote are separated into two different categories, each one with its own value requirements.</p><h3 id=\"non-protocol-consensus-votes\">Non Protocol Consensus Votes</h3><ul><li><strong>Quorum:</strong> 20% of blocks during the voting period</li><li><strong>Approval rate:</strong> >= 60% in favor</li><li><strong>Duration:</strong> 5,040 blocks minimum</li></ul><p>Non protocol consensus votes are proposals that do not require a major change in the protocol to be made. Typically, they would be proposals claiming funds from the Community Fund, for example, or determining the direction of a particular initiative.</p><p>For a non protocol consensus vote to be considered valid, its voting period must be a <strong>minimum of 5,040 blocks (roughly one week). </strong>Within that period, 20% of the blocks staked need to cast a vote for one of the available voting options. That means <strong>the quorum has to be at least 20%</strong>. Finally, to be considered as approved by the community, it needs to reach an <strong>approval rate of at least 60%</strong>, meaning at least 60% of all the votes cast for the proposal are in favor of the proposed idea.</p><h3 id=\"protocol-consensus-votes\">Protocol Consensus Votes</h3><ul><li><strong>Quorum:</strong> 20% of blocks during the voting period</li><li><strong>Approval rate:</strong> >= 75% in favor</li><li><strong>Duration:</strong> 10,080 blocks minimum</li></ul><p>Protocol consensus votes are a bit more important in scope and can have a more significant impact on the ecosystem. They are any proposal that requires a specific change in the protocol, such as, for example, integrating a decentralized treasury model, modifying the inflation rate of the blockchain, introducing a new privacy technology, etc.</p><p>Just like non protocol consensus votes, their <strong>quorum requirement stands at 20%</strong>. But because of their increased level of importance and ramifications, they require a higher level of approval from the community. In fact, the required <strong>approval rate has to be at least 75%</strong>. Finally, the duration of any protocol consensus vote has to be a <strong>minimum of 10,080 blocks (roughly two weeks)</strong> to give ample time to anyone to be able to cast their vote.</p><h1 id=\"potential-voting-outcomes\">Potential Voting Outcomes</h1><p>There are a few possible scenarios to a vote. Here they are with their respective outcome.</p><ul><li>If quorum is not met, the proposal is <strong>REJECTED </strong>❌</li><li>If the quorum is met but the votes fail to meet the target approval rate, the proposal is <strong>REJECTED </strong>❌</li><li>If the quorum is met and the votes reach the approval rate (“Yes”), the proposal is <strong>APPROVED </strong>✅</li><li>If a voting round reaches its expiration before reaching quorum or the target approval rate, the proposal expires and is <strong>REJECTED </strong>❌</li></ul><h1 id=\"proposal-lifecycle\">Proposal Lifecycle</h1><p>Below is the basic process for submitting and evaluating proposals that require a vote.</p><ul><li>A proposal is submitted on the CCS. <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io/how-to-ccs/\"><strong>Click here</strong></a> to see how to submit your own proposal.</li><li>The proposal owner indicates, in the header, whether the proposal requires a vote or not.</li><li>The proposal is reviewed by the CCS administrators and then published.</li><li>Valid proposals are open for discussion for a minimum of one week but voting does not begin immediately. The proposal can be edited by its owner in response to community feedback.</li><li>If a proposal becomes clearly inactive (proposal owner stops commenting on the proposal or does not authorize the start of voting), a CCS administrator may mark the proposal as “Abandoned”. Abandoned proposals are publicly viewable, but cannot be edited, commented on, or be authorized to vote. A CCS administrator can mark a proposal as abandoned at any time before the proposal owner authorizes voting. Once the proposal owner authorizes voting on a proposal, it cannot be abandoned unless the proposal owner revokes voting on the proposal.</li><li>The proposal owner authorizes voting to start. A CCS administrator will then assign a voting block interval to it (duration of the voting period).</li><li>The voting period begins for the number of blocks assigned by the administrator. For example, one week is around 5,040 blocks.</li><li>When the voting period ends, the proposal is formally approved or rejected. This depends on if the quorum and the approval rate are met.</li><li>When a proposal with a budget and deliverables is approved, work can begin. The proposal owner can submit claims for funds upon completion of the milestone deliverables that are pre-defined within the proposal.</li></ul><h2 id=\"community-fund\">Community Fund</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://explorer.particl.io/address/RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Insight</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Particl Insight.

Ever since the initial release of the CCS, the only way to get that funding was through community donations.</p><p>With the on-chain voting system, you will soon be able to claim funds from the <strong><a href=\"https://explorer.particl.io/address/RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM\">Community Fund</a></strong> to help you realize your initiative. And because this Community Fund belongs to all PART holders, it needs their approval to draw funds from it.</p><p>Indeed, to incentivize more use of the CCS system by the community, the team is going to open up the Community Fund. All you’ll need to do to claim the funds is craft a clear proposal that requires a vote and explains your initiative in detail as well as why you need the funds. Then, you need to convince the Particl community to vote in favor of your proposal and approve the claim of funds.</p><h1 id=\"first-proposal-coming-in-on-wednesday-\">First Proposal Coming in on Wednesday!</h1><p>You won’t have to wait for too long to put on your first vote! As soon as this <strong>Wednesday (28th of April, 2021)</strong>, we will publish the first-ever proposal to require the use of the on-chain voting system.<br><br>This proposal, which was widely requested by the community, seeks to nominate the Particl team as managers of the manual claim process required to unfreeze all legitimate anon and blind coins. These coins are currently frozen as part of the emergency hardfork deployed by the team weeks ago and they need to be re-enabled as smoothly as possible. Keep an eye out on Particl News and the CCS on Wednesday for all the details on the proposal!</p><hr><p>With the support of the on-chain voting system as well as the upcoming few proposals, the Particl project is entering a brand new phase that emphasizes the power of the community much more. If you’ve ever had a great idea for a project, business, or service you think would benefit the Particl ecosystem, you’ll have all the tools you need to make it happen, if you can convince the community!</p><p>This addition to the CCS marks a significant milestone for the project and should lead to many more community contributions than we’ve ever seen. Don’t forget, if the decentralized treasury model proposal is approved, the Community Fund is also going to grow in value and, if the price of PART increases, will grow exponentially in value, opening even more doors. This has tremendous potential and we can’t wait to see what you, the community, will create with these resources!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

Core 0.19.2.6 and \nParticl Desktop 2.3.6. These releases aim to ease and streamline the process of\nidentifying anon and blind outputs to assist the team in selecting the best path\nforward and help reveal exploited outputs that can then be blacklisted.\n\nBelow this post, you’ll find a detailed progress report for Particl V3. If you\nwant to jump straight to it, you can click here.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop 2.3.6 and Particl Core 0.19.2.6\nRelease Particl Desktop v2.3.6 · particl/particl-desktopThis patch release\nincludes some minor usability enhancements.NB!! The source code linked to here\nis not the actual tagged release source code. Please contact Particl for source\ncode information. ...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.6] * Desktop\n   download: [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.0.1]\n   https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.6\n * Core\n   download: [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.3]\n   https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.6\n\nParticl Desktop 2.3.6 introduces a new GUI tool to quickly identify the anon and\nblind outputs from all your unlocked wallets. It uses the new Particl Core\n0.19.2.6 release, which improves the output tracing script.\n\nTo see the complete list of changes for Particl Core 0.19.2.6, follow this link\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/branch_0.19.2.6/doc/release-notes-particl.md#01926]\n.\n\nTo use the new tool, simply follow these steps.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1- Open Particl Desktop 2.3.6 and ensure you are running Particl Core 0.19.2.6.\n\n2- Unlock all of your wallets by opening each of them in the bar on the left and\nclicking the lock pad icon at the top right corner of the client.\n\n3- Once all your wallets are unlocked, click on the printer icon at the top\nright corner of the client and a new window will appear.\n\n4- Choose where you want to export your output data, and then click on the \nExport button.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter clicking the Export button, a file named frozen_blinded_data.txt will be\ncreated in the location of your choice. To submit this file to the Particl team,\nsend it to Tecnovert (@tecnovert:matrix.org) on Riot/Element or to Cryptoguard \neither on Telegram/Riot/Element/Discord or by email at cryptoguard@particl.io.\n\nThank you for participating in this output submission process; it will help the\nteam select the best path forward to re-enable frozen outputs and blacklist\nexploited ones!\n\n> Note: Running Particl Desktop 2.3.6 will automatically update your Particl Core\nnode to the latest version. You shouldn’t need to download the new Particl Core\nversion separately unless you want to collect your outputs without using Particl\nDesktop.\nParticl V3 Progress Report\nWe are happy today to also provide a detailed Particl V3 progress report. This\nlist contains all the recent bug fixes and outstanding items since the last\nParticl V3 progress report.\n\nAdditionally, it can now be announced that any slowdown in the progress of\nParticl V3, as mentioned in the March Project Update, has been duly resolved.\nThe development of Particl V3 is now back at a regular pace.\n\nTo-Do\nA list of remaining fixes to include before Particl V3 can go live on mainnet.\nSome of these items are already fixed but require additional testing while the\nothers are relatively minor, except for the zmq.node issue that occurs for some\nWindows users.\n\n * Once a market is blacklisted, it does not allow for further processing of any\n   related activity. For example, the market cannot be removed, product\n   templates for the market cannot be created, etc. The fix has been implemented\n   and is currently in testing phase.\n * An expired listing item that has been added to the cart is automatically\n   removed from the particl-market but remains added to the cart. The fix has\n   been implemented and is currently in testing phase.\n * A situation can occur during which releasing the escrow without completing\n   the “shipping” step can result in both parties becoming stuck in the\n   “shipping step”. The fix has been implemented and is currently in testing\n   phase.\n * Category filter for general markets other than the default Open Marketplace\n   does not work as expected. The fix has been implemented and is currently in\n   testing phase.\n * The change implemented to fix the category filter requires a change to the\n   implementation of selecting a category during the product template\n   creation/editing.\n * Fix the zmq.node error on startup occurring on some Windows machines.\n * Allow external links listed via the Help and Support page to open in the\n   user's browser instead of inside a self-contained webview \"window\". There are\n   some concerns about this, so this will likely be temporary until a better\n   solution can be implemented.\n * Add dynamic loading screen quotations.\n * There is no means to delete a published product from the Inventory tab.\n * Display the category creation modal or otherwise direct the user to the\n   category creation process after creating a new storefront market.\n * Add additional text to the market creation section to ensure that there is no\n   confusion about the market being private by default and only being known if\n   the market details are explicitly shared with others or the market is\n   promoted.\n\nIn Progress\nA list of items currently being worked on.\n\n * Updating Particl Desktop code in V3 to be compatible with recent API\n   improvements applied in particl-market. Needs some significant testing to\n   ensure all things are working, so takes a non-trivial amount of time to\n   complete.\n * In the wallet module, the Address label is not clearly indicated that it\n   requires additional action (clicking the button) to save the label.\n * Test Particl Core 0.19.2.6 with Particl Desktop 3.0, fixing any issues that\n   may occur.\n\nCompleted\nA list of the items that have been completed since the last Particl V3 progress\nreport.\n\n * Add 32-bit Windows builds back in as before.\n * Setting all shipping costs to 0 causes some errors while publishing a product\n   and purchasing.\n * On the listings page, add a checkbox-like control to each item to avoid\n   confusion about unselecting a selected country.\n * Allow for the transaction ID to be selected/copied in the Transaction table.\n * Ensure the 'Show inactive and archived' checkbox in the Orders pages is\n   checked/enabled by default to prevent orders from seemingly disappearing once\n   they are complete.\n * Fixed an error that appeared when the Particl Desktop application is closed\n   while the marketplace is starting.\n * A menu dropdown with no additional identities for selection now indicates no\n   alternative identities for selection (rather than displaying nothing).\n * Presents a missing \"unlock wallet\" prompt when creating a market with an\n   encrypted wallet/identity.\n * Display an alternative error message when accepting a bid fails due to having\n   insufficient available funds.\n * Swap the position of the public and anon balance values in the Market\n   Overview display.\n * Updated a setting description to describe its intended purpose more\n   accurately.\n\nETA\nDue to the recent inflationary bug, all anon and blind outputs are temporarily\nfrozen. And because the Particl Marketplace works using anon and blind outputs,\nit is not operational until the upcoming hardfork that unfreezes outputs occurs.\n\nFor this reason, a mainnet release of Particl V3 is not possible until the\nhardfork. In the meantime, you can expect one or more testnet releases of\nParticl V3 to properly test all the new bug fixes and improvements made to it\nsince the first testnet release.\n\nIf the mainnet release is entirely ready before the hardfork takes place, the\nteam will start working on additional Particl Desktop deliverables/features in a\nseparate branch which may, or may not, be merged in time for the first V3\nmainnet release. If a feature has been started and is not ready for release when\nthe hardfork takes place, it’ll then be included in a subsequent release.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This legal\nentity has served the purpose of funding the development and management of\nParticl as well as supporting the project legally using funds that it raised\nfrom the community in 2017.\n\nAs of November 2020, after slightly more than three years, the Particl\nFoundation has run out of the funds it raised from community donations and as\nsuch, has initiated its shutdown process. A mandatory closure audit is currently\nunderway.\n\nAs a result, the Particl team has since then voluntarily supported the project\nsince no funds are available anymore to pay for salaries, expenses, and fund\ndevelopment and initiatives.\n\nWith today's fast-paced and rapidly evolving blockchain industry, any serious\nproject needs to have enough funding to support its ecosystem, promote its\nproduct(s), and grow its community. Equally important is the necessity to have\nlegal representation so that the project can effectively and safely interact\nwith other parties, manage funds, and own assets (i.e., servers). Without any of\nthis, projects expose themselves to being overrun by competitors who don’t have\nthe same financial struggles.\n\nTo address this critical issue, the Particl team has consulted with a few\nadvisors and community leaders and put together a proposal for a new \ndecentralized treasury model that, if approved by the Particl community, could \nbring enough funding to self-sustain the project at current prices, boost\ncommunity resources, and provide a brand new legal entity to support the project\n.\n\nThis blog post will explain, in full detail, every aspect of the new\ndecentralized treasury model; how it works, its benefits and its parameters.\nThis is a first step aimed at getting you familiarized with the proposed idea.\n\nThen, in a separate blog post that will be published in the next few days on\nParticl News, we will publish a full breakdown of how the Particl team intends\nto claim and use those funds, restructure the project, stimulate the community\nand bring the Particl ecosystem to the next level in all aspects.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Contents\n * The Proposal in Short\n * Proposal Approval and Treasury Governance\n * Funding CCS Initiatives With a Community Fund\n * Additional Benefits\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Proposal in Short\nThis decentralized treasury model proposal, which is closely modelled after that\nof successful projects such as Siacoin and Decred, aims at firing up and\nexpanding Particl into a stronger-than-ever ecosystem by generating more PART\nthat can be put to use to the benefit of the project. The Particl team would\nthen claim funds from this treasury by pushing CCS proposals either quarterly or\nbi-annually.\n\nTo preserve a good level of decentralization and ensure community consensus, the\nintroduction of this new treasury model requires approval from the community\nthrough an on-chain voting process that’s going to be opened up in the days to\ncome. If approved, the modifications necessary to activate the new treasury\nmodel will be included in the upcoming hardfork that re-enables RingCT and CT\ntransactions.\n\nSelf-Sustainability—The Numbers in Detail\n * Circulating supply post-hardfork (estimate): ~11,750,000 PART\n * Proposed yearly inflation rate: 8%\n * Proposed treasury block rewards: 50%\n * Proposed total yearly staking rate (APR for stakers): 4%\n * Proposed yearly treasury rewards (estimates): 470,000 PART\n * Monthly treasury rewards (averaged from estimates): 39,166 PART\n\n> Note: If the proposal is approed, the current 10% “development staking reward”\nis going to be abolished in profit of the new decentralized treasury model.\nIn summary, the proposal for this new decentralized treasury model suggests\nincreasing the yearly inflation rate from 2% to 8% for two years and then \ndecreasing it by 1% every two years until it reaches 6% and stays at that level.\nEvery time the network stakes a block, 50% of the block rewards would then be\nredistributed to stakers and 50% into the Treasury Fund to fund, support,\npromote, and grow the project. That amounts to 4% of the total circulating\nsupply every year.\n\nThis brings the yearly PART staking interest (APY) to a minimum of 4%. Because\nAPY depends on how many coins in total are staking on the network, the true APY\nalways ends up being higher than its minimum rate. For example, if 50% of all\nthe PART coins are staking on the network, the staking APY goes from 4% to\naround 8% yearly.\n\nThis proposed treasury model is all about self-sustainability. Indeed, it\nprovides enough funding in PART to the project to cover salaries for the core\nteam, pay for all related expenses, and fund various promotional budgets at\ncurrent (and lower) PART prices. It also gives the extra resources required to\nexpand the team with more talents and add more expertise to the table. More\ndetails on the internal restructuring of the team and how it intends to claim\nand use those funds will be provided in a separate blog post published in a few\ndays on Particl News.\n\nDuring its first year, the Treasury Fund would earn an average of 39,166 PART\nevery month. This is sufficient, at current price levels of PART = $1, to\nsustain the project and fund various initiatives to take Particl to the next\nlevel. The proposed model is viable down to a PART price of around $0.50.\n\nOf course, the Treasury Fund exclusively gets funded with PART. An increase in\nthe trading value of the coin would then make the incoming revenue more valuable\nin fiat, allowing the team to expand further, fund more initiatives/programs,\nstimulate the community to a greater degree, and accelerate the growth of the\nentire ecosystem even more. For this reason, the Treasury Fund has exponential\ngrowth potential, but it's also important to note that a reduction in the price\nof PART can also have an adverse effect.\n\nProposal Approval and Treasury Governance\nThe Particl team has long been looking to decentralize the project further and\nput more power into the hands of the community. That’s the true spirit of\nblockchain technology, after all, and this is precisely what this new\ndecentralized treasury model achieves.\n\nAs such, this new treasury model is being suggested as a CCS proposal and\nrequires community approval to be set in motion. If the vote passes and the\nproposal is approved, the new treasury model will be put in place in the\nupcoming hardfork.\n\nAs for the governance of the Treasury Fund itself, you, the community, will have\nthe final say over it. To claim funds from it, the Particl team will publish CCS\nproposals every quarter or on a bi-annual basis, depending on a few factors at\nthe time the proposals are published. These proposals will detail how the funds\nare intended to be used, the objectives for the claim period, and what to expect\nin terms of deliverables.\n\nAs mentioned earlier in this blog post, the Particl team will publish shortly a\nseparate blog post exclusively focused on explaining how it will be restructured\nin light of this new decentralized governance (including a brand new legal\nentity), how it intends to claim and use funds moving forward, as well as its\nobjectives and deliverables.\n\nCommunity Governance and On-Chain Voting\nTo approve CCS proposals and claims of funds, the community will be invited to\nvote through the on-chain voting mechanism built into Particl Core. This voting\nsystem uses staking weight, meaning the number of coins being staked, as voting\ntickets. The more coins you stake on the Particl network, the greater your voice\nin these voting events.\n\nIt is possible to vote using clients such as Particl CLI, Particl Desktop, and\nParticl-Qt, but the best way to do it is through Particl’s cold staking\napplication Partyman. To facilitate the process of voting, a GUI integration has\nbeen added to the CCS, effectively tying proposals to on-chain voting events.\n\nMore information about the on-chain voting system, including the consensus and\nquorum requirements, will also be published in a separate blog post focused on\nthe on-chain voting scheduled for in a few days on Particl News.\n\nFunding CCS Initiatives With a Community Fund\nThe implementation of the treasury model, combined with the on-chain voting\nsystem integration into the CCS, will also enable brand-new opportunities at the\ncommunity level. Every month, a number of PART coins coming from the\ndecentralized treasury fund will be sent into a community-governed fund.\n\nThis Community Fund\n[https://explorer.particl.io/address/RTpYPHNhSB6GxjQBb8aN6esj9NEDdtzvGM], which\nalready contains ~25,818 PART coins as a result of unclaimed PART during the\ncoin swap event in 2017, will be made available to the community to be used to\nfund CCS initiatives. For an initiative to be funded by the Community Fund, it\nneeds to first go through a voting process, reach a voting quorum (minimum\nnumber of coins having voted), and approval rate. If that is achieved, then the\nproposal is officially approved by the community. According to the milestone\nschedule, the correct number of coins will be sent from the Community Fund to\nthe initiative’s custodian.\n\nAdditional Benefits\nWhile this blog post simply exclusively intends on explaining the decentralized\ntreasury model proposal, here are some of the benefits it will provide to the\nproject if approved. Of course, much more information on that end will be\npublished in the blog post that will explain how the team intends on using those\nfunds coming in just a few days.\n\n * Complete restructuring of the team’s internal processes, management,\n   leadership, and communications (internal and external).\n * Team expansion as price and market situation permits.\n * More active and rapid development as well as a more constant release\n   schedule.\n * More regular, streamlined, and transparent communication/updates.\n * More active, engaged, and blooming community and ecosystem.\n * More focus on deliverables other than Particl Core, the marketplace, and\n   Particl Desktop.\n * Renewed efforts in getting listed on more prominent exchanges.\n * More financial and human resources to market Particl’s products (i.e. PART\n   coin, Particl Marketplace, BasicSwap DEX, etc.)\n * Many more promotional and user acquisition initiatives.\n * And more…\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe hope that you are as excited as we are about this proposal. It has the power\nto significantly change things around and give the project the spark it needs to\nget the exposure, recognition, resources, and workforce behind it that it\ndeserves.\n\nAs we finally move ahead with a lot of what's been in the works for the last\nweeks, keep an eye out on Particl News and the CCS this week and the next one.\nWe will start publishing lots of new content including follow-up blog posts and\nthe CCS proposals. We invite you to take part in the discussion related to these\nproposals in their respective comment section on the CCS as they get published.\n\nLet’s get this proposal approved, and let’s take Particl to a whole new level!\n\n> The Particl team\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

Every time the network stakes a block,<strong> 50% of the block rewards</strong> would then be redistributed to stakers and <strong>50% into the Treasury Fund</strong> to fund, support, promote, and grow the project.

proceeded to an emergency\nhardfork to fix a critical bug in the code that allowed for the creation of\ncoins in anon balances. The hardfork fixed the issue and temporarily froze anon\nand blind outputs so that exploited ones couldn’t be used anymore.\n\nToday’s post will provide all the details on the way forward post-bug, including\nthe roadmap to closure, the process of re-enabling legitimate outputs,\nestimates, how to help the team out, and more.\n\nThis is a rather important blog post so make sure you read it carefully.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Content\n * Current Figures and Estimations\n * How to Reactivate Legitimate Outputs\n * Supply and Staking Implications\n   [/roadmap-to-post-inflation-hardfork/supply-and-staking-implications]\n * The Roadmap to the Coming Hardfork\n * Help the Team Gather More Information\n * AMA for Any Remaining Questions\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCurrent Figures and Estimations\nAt this moment, it is confirmed that 768,767 PART coins have been successfully\nexploited and transferred back to public balances\n[https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/]. This number can be\nconfirmed by auditing the observed public outputs and comparing the resulting\nfigure with the expected supply.\n\nFor clarity, “observed public outputs” refers to the total number of coins held\nin public balances. In contrast, the “expected public supply” is the number of\ncoins that should be in circulation if a hack never occurred. The expected\nsupply value can be verified by taking Particl’s initial supply and adding all\nthe coins created through staking rewards. The blockchain displays this value\nwhen entering the gettxoutsetinfo command.\n\nBut the extra coins held in public balance are not the only factor contributing\nto Particl’s true post-bug supply. Indeed, legitimate anon outputs, or the total\nnumber of legitimate coins held in anon balances by users, need to be added to\nit. That’s because the current figure of 768,767 extra coins only takes into\naccount public balances. Any legitimate coin held in anon balances will need to\nbe sent to public balances to be re-enabled, bringing the total number of\nexploited coins up as it happens.\n\nIn this case, and based on outputs, blinding factors, and information that have\nbeen already provided by various community members to the team so far, it can be\nconfirmed that at least 770,000 legitimate coins are being held in anon outputs.\nThis brings the confirmed total of exploited coins to 1,538,767 coins (770,000 +\n768,767). This would mean that, if no additional legitimate coin is confirmed to\nbe in anon balances, the post-bug supply of the Particl network will stand at\n11,286,973 coins (1,538,767 + 9,748,206).\n\nOf course, the team expects a few more outputs to be confirmed as the process of\nre-enabling outputs officially begins. Still, it’s likely that the final figure\nshouldn’t diverge by a wide margin from what’s already established.\n\nHow to Reactivate Legitimate Outputs\nOn the March 2021 Project Update\n[https://particl.news/project-update-march-2021/], we mentioned two different\ntechniques that users who have frozen outputs can use to re-enable their coins.\nSince then, we’ve collected and considered community feedback and have improved\nthe solutions to bring more confidence into the process, minimize the burden put\nonto the affected users, and increase privacy. Please read what follows\ncarefully.\n\nLow Pass Filter\nThe easiest way to re-enable legitimate frozen outputs is to use a “low pass\nfilter” tool that will be integrated directly into the Particl Core release that\nwill trigger the coming hardfork. This aims at re-enabling most\nmarketplace-related anon and blind outputs.\n\nThis low pass filter tool allows users with frozen outputs that contain a low\nnumber of coins to automatically re-enable coins. The value of the low pass\nfilter is currently set at 500 coins, meaning any output containing 500 coins or\nless will be able to be effortlessly moved back to a public balance. The low\npass filter's final threshold value may change depending on various factors\nbefore the hardfork goes live but is likely to remain at 500.\n\nThis is the easiest solution for users to re-enable their coins. If your outputs\nqualify for the low pass filter, then all you have to do is wait for the next\nhardfork. You’ll then be able to enter a single command, per output, into your\nParticl Core debug window, which will unfreeze your coins.\n\nIf you wish to keep your coins in anon after re-enabling them, you’ll have to\nfirst transfer them into a public balance and then transfer them back to a new\npost-fork anon address.\n\nManual Claim Process\nIf you own outputs too large for the low pass filter, you will have to go\nthrough a manual claim process. Since this solution was first announced in the \nMarch 2021 Project Update [https://particl.news/project-update-march-2021/], the\nteam has collected feedback from various community members and has come up with\na more streamlined process that would preserve the decentralization of the\nprocess.\n\nInitially, it was planned that every user would need to push a CCS proposal to\nre-enable their outputs. That is to ensure the team has no overbearing power\nover the network and that any output validated is duly approved by the\ncommunity.\n\nWe now propose a more streamlined, private, and straightforward way to process\nthese claims while still retaining decentralization. To simplify the process,\nthe Particl team will push, in the next few days, a proposal on the CCS asking\nfor the community to nominate the team as the managers of the claim process.\n\nIf approved, users will need to send their claims to the team through a secure\nchannel, using a tracer script that can be run within the Particl Core client.\nThis script dumps the amounts, blinding factors, and anon inputs for each step\nuntil it gets to a transaction with plain inputs. It can also optionally dump\nthe privkeys to spent anon outputs to prove the claimed input is correct by\nrecreating the keyimage. However, in most cases, it shouldn’t be necessary.\nAdditional information may be required if the script isn’t enough to fully\nvalidate the source of the funds, although that, too, shouldn’t be necessary in\nthe great majority of cases. This will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe team will then approve or reject individual claims based on the collected\ndata. Any approved claim would be included in a whitelist that will lead to an\ninstant re-enabling of legitimate outputs once the hardfork goes live.\n\nIf a user gets his claim rejected by the team, he will then be able to plead his\ncase to the community by pushing an independent CCS proposal. Claims validated\nby the community through independent CCS proposals will then be added to a\nseparate whitelist, re-enabling the outputs whenever the team proceeds with\nanother hardfork later on in the future.\n\nThis improved solution aims to provide more confidence in the process, reduce\nthe burden put on the user, and increase privacy.\n\n> Note: Voting parameters and consensus requirements will be detailed on a\nseparate blog post focused exclusively on the on-chain voting mechanism.\nSupply and Staking Implications\nBecause this inflation bug led to new coins being created out of thin air, the\ncurrent expected supply of Particl is out of sync with the real supply. To fix\nthat issue, the supply of Particl will be adjusted based on three different\nfactors.\n\n 1. On the day of the coming hardfork, the supply will be increased by the sum\n    of all the coins contained in the whitelist. For example, if there’s a total\n    of 1,000,000 coins in the whitelist, then the supply of Particl will be\n    raised by 1,000,000 on the day of the hardfork.\n 2. The total supply will also be adjusted to the current observed supply, which\n    is the expected supply + the excess of coins in public balances that has\n    already been confirmed in the initial vulnerability disclosure\n    [https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/]. That sums up to a\n    total of 768,767 coins.\n 3. The supply will also be dynamically adjusted every time frozen blinded coins\n    are spent through the low pass filter. If, for example, 50,000 coins are\n    re-enabled using the filter, then the supply will increase by that same\n    amount. To be noted, there are a total of 4,204 unspent anon outputs and\n    1,701 blind ones, of which 420 are not tainted. That means the absolute\n    maximum number of PART coins that can be re-enabled using the low pass\n    filter, if 100% of the outputs contain precisely 500 PART, is 2,952,500 PART\n    coins. However, it is expected that most outputs that will pass through the\n    filter will be on the low end; mostly composed of change or dust outputs and\n    small balances reserved for the Particl Marketplace. Many of these outputs\n    also won’t qualify either because they contain too many coins or because\n    they have already been flagged as fraudulent.\n\nDue to the three factors mentioned here, the real supply of the Particl\nblockchain should stabilize a few days after the coming hardfork.\n\nThe Roadmap to the Coming Hardfork\nThe coming hardfork will provide closure to this inflationary bug event and\nallow the team to jump back into building the Particl ecosystem. Once it goes\nlive, the vast majority of frozen outputs that are legitimate will be re-enabled\nand both anon as well blind balances will be re-activated. That’ll allow Particl\nV3 to go live on mainnet.\n\nThere are still a few events that need to happen before that hardfork can go\nlive. Here is a clear roadmap of what’s left to do before then. Each item is\nmore or less in chronological order.\n\nFinalize and Test the Tracer Script\nParticl Core Developer Tecnovert has been working on the “tracer script” which,\nwhen executed in a Particl client, will automatically validate the legitimacy of\nmany frozen outputs by tracing anon outputs back to public ones.\n\nThe script is currently being finalized and incrementally tested with outputs\nthat have already been provided to the team by a couple of community members.\n\nVote to Nominate the Team as Claim Managers\nAs mentioned earlier in this blog post, the team will soon be pushing a proposal\nto the CCS system to be nominated as managers of the claim process. If approved\nby the community, users will be able to submit their proof directly to the team\ninstead of pushing independent proposals. If the team rejects a claim, the user\nwill still be able to plead his case to the community by making a CCS proposal\nof his own.\n\n> Note: A voting period lasts two weeks and requires at least one week of\npre-notice for discussion and to give enough time for people to become aware of\nit.\nProcess Manual Claims and Compile the Whitelist\nAfter the team’s proposal is approved, claims will need to be collected and\nvalidated. All claims that get approved will be added to a whitelist which will\nautomatically re-enable validated outputs once the next hardfork goes live.\n\nVote On the New Treasury Model and Implement It\nAs a final item before the next hardfork will go live, the team will push a\nsecond proposal to activate the new treasury model. This new treasury model will\nbring funding to the team and allow the Particl project to be back at full\nforce.\n\nIf approved, the team will include the changes (which are relatively simple to\ninclude all things considered) into the code and activate the new treasury model\nwith the next hardfork.\n\nExpect a standalone blog post about this new proposed treasury model on Particl\nNews within the next few days.\n\n> Note: A voting period lasts two weeks and requires at least one week of\npre-notice. The proposal will be published after the first week of the voting\nperiod to nominate the team as claim managers so that both voting periods can be\ncompleted as quickly as possible for the hardfork to go through.\nAt this time, we are looking for the hardfork to go live in around 6 weeks.\nThat’s the time required for both votes to go through and for everything to be\nready. If they are both approved, then the hardfork will re-enable frozen\noutputs and activate the new treasury model at the same time. The team also\nhopes that it can release the Particl V3 mainnet release simultaneously,\nalthough that remains to be seen. As always, this is an estimate based on the\ninformation currently available.

In this\nclient, you'll find a \"printer\" icon at the top right of your screen with a\nsimple button to automate steps 1 to 6 in the following section.\nTo improve the tracer script and flag as many exploited outputs as possible, the\nteam is looking to gather as much information as it can. To help the team out on\nthat quest, Particl Core Developer Tecnovert has put together a series of\ncommands you can enter in any of your wallets that has ever had an anon/blind\nbalance or transaction.\n\n1- Download the latest pre-release of Particl Core (Qt) here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.6alpha2].\n\nRelease 0.19.2.6 Alpha 2 · tecnovert/particl-coreTo downgrade to a previous\nrelease, run debugwallet {\\“downgrade_wallets\\”:true} from the later\nrelease.Hashes668c254e9a0e7d4521d53868ece2691a520f6b2c86976aebdbb6e3b2a5d743ee\nparticl-0.19.2.6-aa...GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.6alpha2]2- Load all your wallets that have or have had anon transactions and/or frozen\noutputs.\n\n3- Open the debug console located in the \"Window\" tab at the top of the wallet.\n\n4- Don't forget to switch your debug console window to the wallet with anon\ntransactions/outputs.

This number can be confirmed by auditing the observed public outputs and comparing the resulting figure with the expected supply.</p><p>For clarity, “observed public outputs” refers to the total number of coins held in public balances. In contrast, the “expected public supply” is the number of coins that should be in circulation if a hack never occurred. The expected supply value can be verified by taking Particl’s initial supply and adding all the coins created through staking rewards. The blockchain displays this value when entering the <code>gettxoutsetinfo</code> command.</p><p>But the extra coins held in public balance are not the only factor contributing to Particl’s true post-bug supply. Indeed, legitimate anon outputs, or the total number of legitimate coins held in anon balances by users, need to be added to it. That’s because the current figure of 768,767 extra coins only takes into account public balances. Any legitimate coin held in anon balances will need to be sent to public balances to be re-enabled, bringing the total number of exploited coins up as it happens.</p><p>In this case, and based on outputs, blinding factors, and information that have been already provided by various community members to the team so far, it can be confirmed that at least 770,000 legitimate coins are being held in anon outputs. This brings the confirmed total of exploited coins to 1,538,767 coins (770,000 + 768,767). This would mean that, if no additional legitimate coin is confirmed to be in anon balances, the post-bug supply of the Particl network will stand at 11,286,973 coins (1,538,767 + 9,748,206).</p><p>Of course, the team expects a few more outputs to be confirmed as the process of re-enabling outputs officially begins. Still, it’s likely that the final figure shouldn’t diverge by a wide margin from what’s already established.</p><h1 id=\"how-to-reactivate-legitimate-outputs\">How to Reactivate Legitimate Outputs</h1><p>On the <a href=\"https://particl.news/project-update-march-2021/\"><strong>March 2021 Project Update</strong></a>, we mentioned two different techniques that users who have frozen outputs can use to re-enable their coins. Since then, we’ve collected and considered community feedback and have improved the solutions to bring more confidence into the process, minimize the burden put onto the affected users, and increase privacy. Please read what follows carefully.</p><h3 id=\"low-pass-filter\">Low Pass Filter</h3><p>The easiest way to re-enable legitimate frozen outputs is to use a “low pass filter” tool that will be integrated directly into the Particl Core release that will trigger the coming hardfork. This aims at re-enabling most marketplace-related anon and blind outputs.</p><p>This low pass filter tool allows users with frozen outputs that contain a low number of coins to automatically re-enable coins. The value of the low pass filter is currently set at 500 coins, meaning any output containing 500 coins or less will be able to be effortlessly moved back to a public balance. The low pass filter's final threshold value may change depending on various factors before the hardfork goes live but is likely to remain at 500.</p><p>This is the easiest solution for users to re-enable their coins. If your outputs qualify for the low pass filter, then all you have to do is wait for the next hardfork. You’ll then be able to enter a single command, per output, into your Particl Core debug window, which will unfreeze your coins.</p><p>If you wish to keep your coins in anon after re-enabling them, you’ll have to first transfer them into a public balance and then transfer them back to a new post-fork anon address.</p><h3 id=\"manual-claim-process\">Manual Claim Process</h3><p>If you own outputs too large for the low pass filter, you will have to go through a manual claim process. Since this solution was first announced in the <a href=\"https://particl.news/project-update-march-2021/\"><strong>March 2021 Project Update</strong></a>, the team has collected feedback from various community members and has come up with a more streamlined process that would preserve the decentralization of the process.</p><p>Initially, it was planned that every user would need to push a CCS proposal to re-enable their outputs. That is to ensure the team has no overbearing power over the network and that any output validated is duly approved by the community.</p><p>We now propose a more streamlined, private, and straightforward way to process these claims while still retaining decentralization. To simplify the process, the Particl team will push, in the next few days, a proposal on the CCS asking for the community to nominate the team as the managers of the claim process.</p><p>If approved, users will need to send their claims to the team through a secure channel, using a tracer script that can be run within the Particl Core client. This script dumps the amounts, blinding factors, and anon inputs for each step until it gets to a transaction with plain inputs. It can also optionally dump the privkeys to spent anon outputs to prove the claimed input is correct by recreating the keyimage. However, in most cases, it shouldn’t be necessary. Additional information may be required if the script isn’t enough to fully validate the source of the funds, although that, too, shouldn’t be necessary in the great majority of cases. This will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>The team will then approve or reject individual claims based on the collected data. Any approved claim would be included in a whitelist that will lead to an instant re-enabling of legitimate outputs once the hardfork goes live.</p><p>If a user gets his claim rejected by the team, he will then be able to plead his case to the community by pushing an independent CCS proposal. Claims validated by the community through independent CCS proposals will then be added to a separate whitelist, re-enabling the outputs whenever the team proceeds with another hardfork later on in the future.</p><p>This improved solution aims to provide more confidence in the process, reduce the burden put on the user, and increase privacy.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> Voting parameters and consensus requirements will be detailed on a separate blog post focused exclusively on the on-chain voting mechanism.</em></blockquote><h1 id=\"supply-and-staking-implications\">Supply and Staking Implications</h1><p>Because this inflation bug led to new coins being created out of thin air, the current expected supply of Particl is out of sync with the real supply. To fix that issue, the supply of Particl will be adjusted based on three different factors.</p><ol><li>On the day of the coming hardfork, the supply will be increased by the sum of all the coins contained in the whitelist. For example, if there’s a total of 1,000,000 coins in the whitelist, then the supply of Particl will be raised by 1,000,000 on the day of the hardfork.</li><li>The total supply will also be adjusted to the current observed supply, which is the expected supply + the excess of coins in public balances that has already been confirmed in the <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/\"><strong>initial vulnerability disclosure</strong></a>. That sums up to a total of 768,767 coins.</li><li>The supply will also be dynamically adjusted every time frozen blinded coins are spent through the low pass filter. If, for example, 50,000 coins are re-enabled using the filter, then the supply will increase by that same amount. To be noted, there are a total of 4,204 unspent anon outputs and 1,701 blind ones, of which 420 are not tainted. That means the absolute maximum number of PART coins that can be re-enabled using the low pass filter, if 100% of the outputs contain precisely 500 PART, is 2,952,500 PART coins. However, it is expected that most outputs that will pass through the filter will be on the low end; mostly composed of change or dust outputs and small balances reserved for the Particl Marketplace. Many of these outputs also won’t qualify either because they contain too many coins or because they have already been flagged as fraudulent.</li></ol><p>Due to the three factors mentioned here, the real supply of the Particl blockchain should stabilize a few days after the coming hardfork.</p><h1 id=\"the-roadmap-to-the-coming-hardfork\">The Roadmap to the Coming Hardfork</h1><p>The coming hardfork will provide closure to this inflationary bug event and allow the team to jump back into building the Particl ecosystem. Once it goes live, the vast majority of frozen outputs that are legitimate will be re-enabled and both anon as well blind balances will be re-activated. That’ll allow Particl V3 to go live on mainnet.</p><p>There are still a few events that need to happen before that hardfork can go live. Here is a clear roadmap of what’s left to do before then. Each item is more or less in chronological order.</p><h3 id=\"finalize-and-test-the-tracer-script\">Finalize and Test the Tracer Script</h3><p>Particl Core Developer Tecnovert has been working on the “tracer script” which, when executed in a Particl client, will automatically validate the legitimacy of many frozen outputs by tracing anon outputs back to public ones.</p><p>The script is currently being finalized and incrementally tested with outputs that have already been provided to the team by a couple of community members.</p><h3 id=\"vote-to-nominate-the-team-as-claim-managers\">Vote to Nominate the Team as Claim Managers</h3><p>As mentioned earlier in this blog post, the team will soon be pushing a proposal to the CCS system to be nominated as managers of the claim process. If approved by the community, users will be able to submit their proof directly to the team instead of pushing independent proposals. If the team rejects a claim, the user will still be able to plead his case to the community by making a CCS proposal of his own.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> A voting period lasts two weeks and requires at least one week of pre-notice for discussion and to give enough time for people to become aware of it.</em></blockquote><h3 id=\"process-manual-claims-and-compile-the-whitelist\">Process Manual Claims and Compile the Whitelist</h3><p>After the team’s proposal is approved, claims will need to be collected and validated. All claims that get approved will be added to a whitelist which will automatically re-enable validated outputs once the next hardfork goes live.</p><h3 id=\"vote-on-the-new-treasury-model-and-implement-it\">Vote On the New Treasury Model and Implement It</h3><p>As a final item before the next hardfork will go live, the team will push a second proposal to activate the new treasury model. This new treasury model will bring funding to the team and allow the Particl project to be back at full force.</p><p>If approved, the team will include the changes (which are relatively simple to include all things considered) into the code and activate the new treasury model with the next hardfork.</p><p>Expect a standalone blog post about this new proposed treasury model on Particl News within the next few days.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> A voting period lasts two weeks and requires at least one week of pre-notice. The proposal will be published after the first week of the voting period to nominate the team as claim managers so that both voting periods can be completed as quickly as possible for the hardfork to go through.</em></blockquote><p>At this time, we are looking for the hardfork to go live in around 6 weeks. That’s the time required for both votes to go through and for everything to be ready. If they are both approved, then the hardfork will re-enable frozen outputs and activate the new treasury model at the same time. The team also hopes that it can release the Particl V3 mainnet release simultaneously, although that remains to be seen. As always, this is an estimate based on the information currently available. We will communicate to the community if any delay occurs.</p><h1 id=\"help-the-team-gather-more-information\">Help the Team Gather More Information</h1><blockquote><em><strong>UPDATE:</strong> You can now more easily collect your outputs simply by downloading and installing <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v2.3.6\">Particl Desktop 2.3.6</a></strong>.

unforeseen event\n[https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/], the March Project\nUpdate has landed. This update is a major one and contains a lot of information\nabout what has transpired in the past few weeks and what’s coming ahead with\nParticl in 2021 and beyond. Indeed, you DON’T want to skip on this update so\nlet’s jump right into it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Contents\n * Latest Information on the Inflationary Bug and the Proposed Solutions\n * Particl V3 Update\n * A Proposal for an Improved and More Sustainable Treasury Model\n * Atomic Swaps are Coming to Particl Desktop\n * New CCS Proposal\n * Particl Ends 2020 Strongly in Global Github Commit Rankings\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLatest Information on the Inflationary Bug and the Proposed Solutions\nSince the initial disclosure of the inflationary vulnerability\n[https://particl.news/particl-vulnerability-disclosure/], the Particl team has\nbeen working on solutions to whitelist legitimate anon outputs but keep the\nexploited ones frozen in perpetuity. Today, we are happy to bring more details\nand clarity on the situation and explain the way forward.\n\nHardforks Schedule\nTo limit the impact of having RingCT and CT transactions disabled any further\n(such as, for example, the inability to release Particl V3 without it), the team\nhas opted to adopt a multi-fork approach instead of a two-fork one, as initially\nproposed.\n\nNext Hardfork\nThe next hardfork, which is expected to go live in April, will re-enable RingCT\nand CT transactions as well unfreeze the majority of legitimate outputs\ncurrently frozen. Once completed, it will also enable the Particl V3 release to\ngo live on mainnet.\n\nIf you want to know all the changes integrated into the second hardfork, please\nconsult its PR on Github by following this link: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-core/pull/81\n\nHf2 by tecnovert · Pull Request #81 · particl/particl-coreSecond fork of\nexploit\nfix. RCT exploit fix. Hard fork 2 consensus changes: All frozen anon and blind\noutputs must be spent to plain with no blinded change. Blinding factor sum for\nCT txns is ...GitHubparticl [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/pull/81]At\nthis time, the majority of the base requirements for the second hardfork to go\nlive are ready. The team is finalizing the portion of the code required to\nwhitelist outputs and undergoing a full RingCT and CT internal audit to ensure\nthe code's integrity before going live with the hardfork.\n\nAdditionally, the team is working separately on additional changes related to a\ntreasury model proposal which is detailed a bit further down this update. If the\ntreasury proposal is approved, it’ll be integrated into the code for the next\nhardfork.\n\nLegitimate Outputs Whitelisting Process\nUsers with legitimate anon or blind balances will be able to unfreeze and move\nthem back to public balances. For the vast majority of users, this will be\npossible right after the next hardfork goes live but, in some specific cases, a\nprocess involving more manual steps will be required. If you fall into that\ncategory, your anon and blind balances will be unfrozen in a subsequent hardfork\na bit later on after the next one.\n\nHere are the two methods used to unfreeze legitimate anon and blind balances.\n\n 1. A “low pass filter” will allow any output that contains a number of coins\n    below a certain threshold to be unfrozen. As the attacker generated large\n    outputs on which balance transfers were drawn from, this won’t unfreeze\n    exploited outputs. The exact value of the threshold will be confirmed in a\n    separate blog post coming shortly in the next week or two.\n 2. Users with legitimate balances larger than the low pass filter’s threshold\n    will need to go through a manual claim process that will require them to\n    prove the coins' legitimacy. This can be done using various methods. Which\n    method is used will be up to the user. Claims will need to be presented to\n    the community through a CCS proposal (using a template provided by the team)\n    and then be approved through on-chain voting. Once approved, the outputs\n    will be marked as unfrozen as soon as another hardfork goes live later in\n    the year. This process ensures that the entire process remains decentralized\n    and that no single party (in this case, the Particl team) can\n    single-handedly take such a critical decision. More details on this process\n    will also be provided in a separate blog post coming in a week or two on\n    Particl News.\n\nAs this claim process (option 2) requires manual input from users, a long-enough\ntime-frame will be granted to allow everyone that needs to go through it enough\ntime to do so.\n\nAdjusted Total Supply and Implications\nOne of the consequences of this bug is the inflation of the total supply, which\nisn’t yet reflected officially by the blockchain. In fact, because of the\nstealthy nature of the exploit, the total supply that the blockchain displays is\nthe one expected if there never was any inflationary bug. This will be adjusted\nto its actual value in two different ways.\n\nFirst off, the supply will dynamically adjust itself as users move their\nlegitimate anon and blind outputs through the low pass filter. Whenever a\nsuccessful low pass transaction occurs, the blockchain will automatically detect\nit and adjust its supply accordingly.\n\nSecondly, the supply will also be adjusted once the hardfork that whitelists\noutputs approved by the community through the CCS goes live. Any new coin being\nunfrozen through this process will be added to the total Particl supply.\n\nWhat this means is that, by the end of the manual claim process, the supply will\nbe fully adjusted to its true value and will display the real, post-inflation\nsupply. The team currently estimates the final number of exploited coins to\nrange between 1.5M and 2M, including the already-confirmed exploited coins\n(768,767 coins).\n\nPlease take note that this is just a rough estimate based on various information\nthe team has gathered since the first hardfork (holders who’ve contacted the\nteam, evidence on the blockchain, and so on). The actual number may end up being\nslightly higher, or slightly lower, but should ultimately trend towards those\nnumbers.\n\nOther Implications\nThis inflationary event also bears other implications for the network.\n\n * An increase in staking rewards size will be observed. In fact, the size of\n   rewards will go up by the same amount as the supply goes up. If, for example,\n   the total supply ends up being inflated by 15%, then staking rewards will\n   also grow in size by an equal 15%. That’s because staking rewards are\n   calculated based on a percentage of the total supply.\n * Other projects that had forked Particl’s RingCT protocol were contacted\n   privately and disclosed the vulnerability before the public announcement. The\n   Veil project has been contacted but found not to be vulnerable due to a\n   different implementation. The Ghost project, on the other hand, has been\n   found to be vulnerable but has swiftly patched the vulnerability. We’d like\n   to thank both teams for their support and urgency in addressing the\n   situation.\n\nParticl V3 Update\nIt can be reported that a significant slow down has been observed in the\nfinalization of Particl V3 in the past few weeks due to personal issues that led\nto a strain in time availability. This is in the process of being resolved and\nwe expect the development of Particl V3 and Particl Desktop to resume at its\nusual pace (and, more likely, at a faster pace than it used to) in the next few\ndays.\n\nFor this reason, we do not have any specific update on Particl V3 for the\nmoment, but we fully expect to have a report ready to go live before the next\nProject Update in April. We also expect the new testnet version to go live\nbefore that time.\n\nTo understand a bit more where things are headed for Particl and how the project\nis about to get back full steam ahead, carefully read the next section.\n\nA Proposal for an Improved and More Sustainable Treasury Model\nAs it was communicated a few months ago\n[https://particl.foundation/foundation-announcement], the Particl Foundation has\npaid all outstanding payments to its contractors (which includes developers).\nThis necessary action (due to agreed commitments with said contractors) has\nseverely depleted the Foundation’s reserves leading it to initiate its shutdown\nprocess.\n\nAs a result, the Particl team had to pause salaries until a new funding solution\nappeared, which caused the project to temporarily go back to a voluntary-based\ncontribution model. This has, unfortunately, led to a considerable reduction in\ntime availability for most of the team members due to other temporary\ncommitments needed to be made to make ends meet.\n\nAdditionally, the looming release of Particl V3, which is arguably the biggest\nParticl release ever since the project’s inception, is right around the corner\nwith only a few changes needed to be applied for it to go live on mainnet. The\nproblem? The team doesn’t have access to proper funding anymore to promote it at\nits just value and give it the exposure it deserves. This situation, combined\nwith the voluntary-basis contribution model that is in play, motivated the team\nto work on a creative but effective solution to get the project funded once\nagain and be back in action full steam ahead.\n\nA New and Improved Treasury Model\nFor the reasons mentioned above, and to ensure the proper development and\neffective promotion of the project in the many years to come, the team has been\nworking relentlessly on a new, more robust treasury model which would guarantee\nenough funding to support the project. This would ultimately provide the project\nwith just as much financial support as the project had at its peak and\neventually surpass this level.\n\nThe new treasury model being designed doesn’t aim at reinventing the wheel. At\ncurrent PART prices, self-sustainability can be achieved by tweaking the current\ntreasury model which, at this moment, reserves 10% of all the staking rewards to\nsupport the project. The Particl team is modelling the new treasury figures\nafter that of very successful and top-rated projects in the space such as\nDecred, Siacoin, and others which have adopted similar self-funding strategy.\nDoing so has proven to be an overwhelming and indisputable success for these\nprojects.\n\nWhat to Expect?\nWhile the numbers around the new treasury model are still being simulated and\nevaluated, this would allow for the immediate full funding of the Particl team\nat current PART prices and would provide enough funds to reserve in various\nbudgets aimed at supporting and promoting the project as well as stimulate user\ngrowth.\n\nAs the treasury model is based on PART staking, an increase in PART prices would\ndirectly translate to a more significant source of funding for the project which\ncould, eventually, be used to expand the team with new members (developers and\nnon-developers), fund campaigns (i.e. marketing, user growth, etc), fund\npromotional efforts, and fund various budgets such as exchange listings, just as\nan example. This model has, in fact, exponential potential.\n\nOf course, before any expansion process beings, the first step is to fire up the\nengine once again and stabilize the new Particl internal structure. A team\nexpansion is a time-consuming process with various considerations and thus, is\nplanned for when the time will be suitable for it.\n\nAs a result of this new source of funding, you can expect the Particl project to\nbe back in the midst of action and be as strong, and even stronger, as it was at\nits peak. You can also expect a much faster pace of development, more frequent\ncommunication, more transparency, more promotional efforts, more marketing, more\nuser growth/adoption initiatives, and so on. This is the key to ensure Particl’s\nsuccess not only this year but in the many years that stand ahead of us all.\n\nSubmitted as a CCS Proposal\nThe team is currently implementing a better UI for the on-chain voting system in\nthe CCS system and it should go live in a week or two. That’ll allow you to\nbetter visualize the proposals, current voting, and etc.\n\nBecause this new treasury model changes the values of the yearly staking\ninterest rate as well as the percentage of all staking rewards being reserved\nfor the development and promotion of the Particl project, community consensus\nhas to be achieved at the protocol level to ensure an optimal level of\ndecentralization.\n\nAnother important point is that all the block rewards going to the treasury fund\nwill require an on-chain vote to be spent. Every quarter, the Particl team will\nsubmit a CCS proposal to have its budget approved by the community using\non-chain voting. This ultimately gives the community the final say, furthers the\nlevel of decentralization of the project (and its governance), and keeps the\nteam accountable to every PART holder to ensure it always acts in the best\ninterest of the ecosystem.\n\nFull Details Coming in a Separate Blog Post\nJust like with the information surrounding the proposed solutions for the\ninflationary bug, the precise details, figures, and in-depth information about\nthe treasury model proposal will be posted in a separate blog post that is\nlikely to go out next week on Particl News. Stay tuned as the team is in the\nprocess of finalizing all the details!\n\nAtomic Swaps are Coming to Particl Desktop\nBut wait, there’s more being worked on! Over the past few months, a great\nsurprise has been cooking up and is now ready to be revealed; atomic swaps are\ncoming right to Particl Desktop thanks to a new Particl-based distributed\nexchange protocol.\n\nEarly Design of the BasicSwap-Powered Swap Module on Particl V3 (WIP)In fact,\nParticl Core Developer Tecnovert has been working on BasicSwap, an anonymous DEX\nprotocol that uses SMSG to allow people to swap, without any third-party,\ncryptocurrencies using atomic swaps. BasicSwap is currently functional and is in\nits Closed Beta phase where various testers have been experimenting with it for\na few weeks. This anonymous DEX protocol, which currently supports Particl,\nMonero, Bitcoin, and Litecoin, has many benefits that will go a long way in\nmaking PART and other cryptocurrencies more resilient and widely accessible to\nall.\n\nIt uses Particl’s SMSG P2P network and the atomic swap protocol to allow you to\nexchange cryptocurrencies without requiring a third-party or wrapped assets. The\nswaps are pretty fast; in fact, swapping PART for LTC averages 20 to 25 minutes\nper swap (after both transactions are fully confirmed), which is also the same\nfor PART/XMR swaps. Of course, the actual time required for a swap to fully\ncomplete is entirely dependent on the confirmation times of the two coins being\ntraded.\n\nCompleted Mainnet Swaps Using the BasicSwap Back-End (Mainnet)To make it as easy\nto use as possible, the BasicSwap protocol will eventually be integrated into\nthe user interface of Particl Desktop. Swapping cryptocurrencies will be\npossible through a new Particl V3 “Swap” module and won’t require the syncing of\nother coin nodes.\n\nThis new atomic swap module isn’t planned to be released with the initial\nmainnet launch of Particl V3 but is expected to go live in one of the subsequent\nfew Particl Desktop updates that come after it. Even though this project is\ncurrently being delayed due to the commitment required from Particl Core\nDeveloper Tecnovert to fix the inflationary bug, BasicSwap is fully expected to\nbe accelerated by the potential funding provided by the new treasury model.\n\nKeep an eye out for an announcement of an Open Beta as well as more information\nabout this tool as soon as the Particl developers can get back to working on\ntheir previous tasks after the inflationary bug is dealt with. That should come\nshortly after the release of Particl V3 on mainnet.\n\nNew CCS Proposal\nA few weeks ago, a new proposal was added to the CCS system. Authored by Particl\ncommunity member ffmad, it proposes to fund the development and creation of a \nmarket API [https://github.com/particl/particl-market] (Particl V3)\ndocumentation. This proposal seeks to help anyone set up a market node and use\nit just like DeMarkets.io did with the explorer for Particl V2.\n\nThe requested donations are on the low end (1,200 PART), so if you’d like to\ncontribute, check out the proposal on the CCS here [https://ccs.particl.io/].\n\n> Note: The Particl node of the CCS will be updated next week, after which\nprevious proposals will be updated. This will also move this proposal from the\nIdea stage into the Funding Required stage.\nParticl Ends 2020 Strongly in Global Github Commit Rankings\nCryptoMiso - Ranking cryptocurrencies based on Github commitsCryptoMiso is a\nweb\nservice ranking cryptocurrencies based on the commit history of their most\npopular Github repository.CryptoMisoBart Claeys [https://www.cryptomiso.com/]The\nYear 2020 has been a different one than previous years for the Particl project.\nThis is primarily because Particl kept most of its development in private\nrepositories as the team was working on the Particl V3 massive update. This\nmeant that only a tiny percentage of the progress was able to be publicly\ntracked on Github. Regardless, being a Bitcoin fork has many benefits for\nParticl, an obvious one being that it effectively leverages the entire\ndevelopment community of Bitcoin.\n\nIn fact, Particl Core Developer Tecnovert constantly keeps the Particl code\nup-to-date with Bitcoin’s codebase. That means regularly pulling Bitcoin\nupdates, modifying the code to make it Particl compatible, and merging it\nwithout breaking anything else. This is obviously no small task, and this is\nreflected in CryptoMiso’s yearly Github commit leaderboard (2020), where Particl\nranked 4th in terms of the number of commits for the whole year! Particl\ncurrently ranks 5th in the past 12 months, and that doesn’t even take into\naccount the development made to the private repositories of Particl Desktop and\nthe BasicSwap DEX protocol.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Best is Yet to Come\nAlthough Particl is going through an unfortunate situation at this moment, it’s\nalso about to turn it into the best and most productive event since the\ninception of the project itself with the proposed new treasury model.\n\nWe understand that the current times can be challenging, but rest assured that\nthe best is yet to come! The team’s getting ready to fire up the engine full\nsteam ahead once again, scale back up, properly promote the project and its\nproducts, and come back into the midst of action with a strong bang!\n\nIt’s definitive.

Today, we are happy to bring more details and clarity on the situation and explain the way forward.</p><h3 id=\"hardforks-schedule\">Hardforks Schedule</h3><p>To limit the impact of having RingCT and CT transactions disabled any further (such as, for example, the inability to release Particl V3 without it), <strong>the team has opted to adopt a multi-fork approach</strong> instead of a two-fork one, as initially proposed.</p><h3 id=\"next-hardfork\">Next Hardfork</h3><p>The next hardfork, which is expected to go live in April, will re-enable RingCT and CT transactions as well unfreeze the majority of legitimate outputs currently frozen. Once completed, it will also enable the Particl V3 release to go live on mainnet.</p><p>If you want to know all the changes integrated into the second hardfork, please consult its PR on Github by following this link: <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/pull/81\"><strong>https://github.com/particl/particl-core/pull/81</strong></a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/pull/81\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Hf2 by tecnovert · Pull Request #81 · particl/particl-core</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Second fork of exploit fix.

The team is finalizing the portion of the code required to whitelist outputs and undergoing a <strong>full RingCT and CT internal audit</strong> to ensure the code's integrity before going live with the hardfork.</p><p>Additionally, the team is working separately on additional changes related to a treasury model proposal which is detailed a bit further down this update. If the treasury proposal is approved, it’ll be integrated into the code for the next hardfork.</p><h3 id=\"legitimate-outputs-whitelisting-process\">Legitimate Outputs Whitelisting Process</h3><p>Users with legitimate anon or blind balances will be able to unfreeze and move them back to public balances. For the vast majority of users, this will be possible right after the next hardfork goes live but, in some specific cases, a process involving more manual steps will be required. If you fall into that category, your anon and blind balances will be unfrozen in a subsequent hardfork a bit later on after the next one.</p><p>Here are the two methods used to unfreeze legitimate anon and blind balances.</p><ol><li>A “<strong>low pass filter</strong>” will allow any output that contains a number of coins below a certain threshold to be unfrozen. As the attacker generated large outputs on which balance transfers were drawn from, this won’t unfreeze exploited outputs. The exact value of the threshold will be confirmed in a separate blog post coming shortly in the next week or two.</li><li>Users with legitimate balances larger than the low pass filter’s threshold will need to go through a <strong>manual claim process</strong> that will require them to prove the coins' legitimacy. This can be done using various methods. Which method is used will be up to the user. Claims will need to be presented to the community through a CCS proposal (using a template provided by the team) and then be approved through on-chain voting. Once approved, the outputs will be marked as unfrozen as soon as another hardfork goes live later in the year. This process ensures that the entire process remains decentralized and that no single party (in this case, the Particl team) can single-handedly take such a critical decision. More details on this process will also be provided in a separate blog post coming in a week or two on Particl News.</li></ol><p>As this claim process (option 2) requires manual input from users, a long-enough time-frame will be granted to allow everyone that needs to go through it enough time to do so.</p><h3 id=\"adjusted-total-supply-and-implications\">Adjusted Total Supply and Implications</h3><p>One of the consequences of this bug is the inflation of the total supply, which isn’t yet reflected officially by the blockchain. In fact, because of the stealthy nature of the exploit, the total supply that the blockchain displays is the one expected if there never was any inflationary bug. This will be adjusted to its actual value in two different ways.</p><p>First off, <strong>the supply will dynamically adjust itself as users move their legitimate anon and blind outputs through the low pass filter</strong>. Whenever a successful low pass transaction occurs, the blockchain will automatically detect it and adjust its supply accordingly.</p><p>Secondly, <strong>the supply will also be adjusted once the hardfork that whitelists outputs approved by the community through the CCS goes live</strong>. Any new coin being unfrozen through this process will be added to the total Particl supply.</p><p>What this means is that, by the end of the manual claim process, the supply will be fully adjusted to its true value and will display the real, post-inflation supply. The team currently estimates the final number of exploited coins to range between 1.5M and 2M, including the already-confirmed exploited coins (768,767 coins).</p><p>Please take note that this is just a rough estimate based on various information the team has gathered since the first hardfork (holders who’ve contacted the team, evidence on the blockchain, and so on). The actual number may end up being slightly higher, or slightly lower, but should ultimately trend towards those numbers.</p><h3 id=\"other-implications\">Other Implications</h3><p>This inflationary event also bears other implications for the network.</p><ul><li><strong>An increase in staking rewards size</strong> will be observed. In fact, the size of rewards will go up by the same amount as the supply goes up. If, for example, the total supply ends up being inflated by 15%, then staking rewards will also grow in size by an equal 15%. That’s because staking rewards are calculated based on a percentage of the total supply.</li><li>Other projects that had forked Particl’s RingCT protocol were contacted privately and disclosed the vulnerability before the public announcement. The Veil project has been contacted but found not to be vulnerable due to a different implementation. The Ghost project, on the other hand, has been found to be vulnerable but has swiftly patched the vulnerability. We’d like to thank both teams for their support and urgency in addressing the situation.</li></ul><h1 id=\"particl-v3-update\">Particl V3 Update</h1><p>It can be reported that a significant slow down has been observed in the finalization of Particl V3 in the past few weeks due to personal issues that led to a strain in time availability. This is in the process of being resolved and we expect the development of Particl V3 and Particl Desktop to resume at its usual pace (and, more likely, at a faster pace than it used to) in the next few days.</p><p>For this reason, we do not have any specific update on Particl V3 for the moment, but we fully expect to have a report ready to go live before the next Project Update in April. We also expect the new testnet version to go live before that time.</p><p>To understand a bit more where things are headed for Particl and how the project is about to get back full steam ahead, carefully read the next section.</p><h1 id=\"a-proposal-for-an-improved-and-more-sustainable-treasury-model\">A Proposal for an Improved and More Sustainable Treasury Model</h1><p>As <strong><a href=\"https://particl.foundation/foundation-announcement\">it was communicated a few months ago</a></strong>, the Particl Foundation has paid all outstanding payments to its contractors (which includes developers). This necessary action (due to agreed commitments with said contractors) has severely depleted the Foundation’s reserves <strong>leading it to initiate its shutdown process</strong>.</p><p>As a result, the Particl team had to pause salaries until a new funding solution appeared, which caused the project to temporarily go back to a voluntary-based contribution model. This has, unfortunately, led to a considerable reduction in time availability for most of the team members due to other temporary commitments needed to be made to make ends meet.</p><p>Additionally, the looming release of Particl V3, which is arguably the biggest Particl release ever since the project’s inception, is right around the corner with only a few changes needed to be applied for it to go live on mainnet. The problem? The team doesn’t have access to proper funding anymore to promote it at its just value and give it the exposure it deserves. This situation, combined with the voluntary-basis contribution model that is in play, motivated the team to work on a creative but effective solution to get the project funded once again and be back in action full steam ahead.</p><h3 id=\"a-new-and-improved-treasury-model\">A New and Improved Treasury Model</h3><p>For the reasons mentioned above, and to ensure the proper development and effective promotion of the project in the many years to come, <strong>the team has been working relentlessly on a new, more robust treasury model which would guarantee enough funding to support the project</strong>. This would ultimately provide the project with just as much financial support as the project had at its peak and eventually surpass this level.</p><p>The new treasury model being designed doesn’t aim at reinventing the wheel. At current PART prices, self-sustainability can be achieved by tweaking the current treasury model which, at this moment, reserves 10% of all the staking rewards to support the project. The Particl team is modelling the new treasury figures after that of very successful and top-rated projects in the space such as Decred, Siacoin, and others which have adopted similar self-funding strategy. Doing so has proven to be an overwhelming and indisputable success for these projects.</p><h3 id=\"what-to-expect\">What to Expect?</h3><p>While the numbers around the new treasury model are still being simulated and evaluated, this would allow for the <strong>immediate full funding of the Particl team at current PART prices</strong> and would provide enough funds to reserve in various budgets aimed at supporting and promoting the project as well as stimulate user growth.</p><p>As the treasury model is based on PART staking, <strong>an increase in PART prices would directly translate to a more significant source of funding for the project</strong> which could, eventually, be used to expand the team with new members (developers and non-developers), fund campaigns (i.e. marketing, user growth, etc), fund promotional efforts, and fund various budgets such as exchange listings, just as an example. This model has, in fact, exponential potential.</p><p>Of course, before any expansion process beings, the first step is to fire up the engine once again and stabilize the new Particl internal structure. A team expansion is a time-consuming process with various considerations and thus, is planned for when the time will be suitable for it.</p><p>As a result of this new source of funding, you can expect the Particl project to be back in the midst of action and be as strong, and even stronger, as it was at its peak. You can also expect a much faster pace of development, more frequent communication, more transparency, more promotional efforts, more marketing, more user growth/adoption initiatives, and so on. This is the key to ensure Particl’s success not only this year but in the many years that stand ahead of us all.</p><h3 id=\"submitted-as-a-ccs-proposal\">Submitted as a CCS Proposal</h3><p>The team is currently implementing a better UI for the on-chain voting system in the CCS system and it should go live in a week or two. That’ll allow you to better visualize the proposals, current voting, and etc.</p><p>Because this new treasury model changes the values of the yearly staking interest rate as well as the percentage of all staking rewards being reserved for the development and promotion of the Particl project, community consensus has to be achieved at the protocol level to ensure an optimal level of decentralization.</p><p>Another important point is that all the block rewards going to the treasury fund will require an on-chain vote to be spent. <strong>Every quarter, the Particl team will submit a CCS proposal to have its budget approved by the community using on-chain voting</strong>. This ultimately gives the community the final say, furthers the level of decentralization of the project (and its governance), and keeps the team accountable to every PART holder to ensure it always acts in the best interest of the ecosystem.</p><h3 id=\"full-details-coming-in-a-separate-blog-post\">Full Details Coming in a Separate Blog Post</h3><p>Just like with the information surrounding the proposed solutions for the inflationary bug, the precise details, figures, and in-depth information about the treasury model proposal will be posted in a separate blog post that is likely to go out next week on Particl News.

Today, we are happy to bring more details and clarity on the situation and explain the way forward.</p><h3 id=\"hardforks-schedule\">Hardforks Schedule</h3><p>To limit the impact of having RingCT and CT transactions disabled any further (such as, for example, the inability to release Particl V3 without it), <strong>the team has opted to adopt a multi-fork approach</strong> instead of a two-fork one, as initially proposed.</p><h3 id=\"next-hardfork\">Next Hardfork</h3><p>The next hardfork, which is expected to go live in April, will re-enable RingCT and CT transactions as well unfreeze the majority of legitimate outputs currently frozen. Once completed, it will also enable the Particl V3 release to go live on mainnet.</p><p>If you want to know all the changes integrated into the second hardfork, please consult its PR on Github by following this link: <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/pull/81\"><strong>https://github.com/particl/particl-core/pull/81</strong></a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/pull/81\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Hf2 by tecnovert · Pull Request #81 · particl/particl-core</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Second fork of exploit fix.

The team is finalizing the portion of the code required to whitelist outputs and undergoing a <strong>full RingCT and CT internal audit</strong> to ensure the code's integrity before going live with the hardfork.</p><p>Additionally, the team is working separately on additional changes related to a treasury model proposal which is detailed a bit further down this update. If the treasury proposal is approved, it’ll be integrated into the code for the next hardfork.</p><h3 id=\"legitimate-outputs-whitelisting-process\">Legitimate Outputs Whitelisting Process</h3><p>Users with legitimate anon or blind balances will be able to unfreeze and move them back to public balances. For the vast majority of users, this will be possible right after the next hardfork goes live but, in some specific cases, a process involving more manual steps will be required. If you fall into that category, your anon and blind balances will be unfrozen in a subsequent hardfork a bit later on after the next one.</p><p>Here are the two methods used to unfreeze legitimate anon and blind balances.</p><ol><li>A “<strong>low pass filter</strong>” will allow any output that contains a number of coins below a certain threshold to be unfrozen. As the attacker generated large outputs on which balance transfers were drawn from, this won’t unfreeze exploited outputs. The exact value of the threshold will be confirmed in a separate blog post coming shortly in the next week or two.</li><li>Users with legitimate balances larger than the low pass filter’s threshold will need to go through a <strong>manual claim process</strong> that will require them to prove the coins' legitimacy. This can be done using various methods. Which method is used will be up to the user. Claims will need to be presented to the community through a CCS proposal (using a template provided by the team) and then be approved through on-chain voting. Once approved, the outputs will be marked as unfrozen as soon as another hardfork goes live later in the year. This process ensures that the entire process remains decentralized and that no single party (in this case, the Particl team) can single-handedly take such a critical decision. More details on this process will also be provided in a separate blog post coming in a week or two on Particl News.</li></ol><p>As this claim process (option 2) requires manual input from users, a long-enough time-frame will be granted to allow everyone that needs to go through it enough time to do so.</p><h3 id=\"adjusted-total-supply-and-implications\">Adjusted Total Supply and Implications</h3><p>One of the consequences of this bug is the inflation of the total supply, which isn’t yet reflected officially by the blockchain. In fact, because of the stealthy nature of the exploit, the total supply that the blockchain displays is the one expected if there never was any inflationary bug. This will be adjusted to its actual value in two different ways.</p><p>First off, <strong>the supply will dynamically adjust itself as users move their legitimate anon and blind outputs through the low pass filter</strong>. Whenever a successful low pass transaction occurs, the blockchain will automatically detect it and adjust its supply accordingly.</p><p>Secondly, <strong>the supply will also be adjusted once the hardfork that whitelists outputs approved by the community through the CCS goes live</strong>. Any new coin being unfrozen through this process will be added to the total Particl supply.</p><p>What this means is that, by the end of the manual claim process, the supply will be fully adjusted to its true value and will display the real, post-inflation supply. The team currently estimates the final number of exploited coins to range between 1.5M and 2M, including the already-confirmed exploited coins (768,767 coins).</p><p>Please take note that this is just a rough estimate based on various information the team has gathered since the first hardfork (holders who’ve contacted the team, evidence on the blockchain, and so on). The actual number may end up being slightly higher, or slightly lower, but should ultimately trend towards those numbers.</p><h3 id=\"other-implications\">Other Implications</h3><p>This inflationary event also bears other implications for the network.</p><ul><li><strong>An increase in staking rewards size</strong> will be observed. In fact, the size of rewards will go up by the same amount as the supply goes up. If, for example, the total supply ends up being inflated by 15%, then staking rewards will also grow in size by an equal 15%. That’s because staking rewards are calculated based on a percentage of the total supply.</li><li>Other projects that had forked Particl’s RingCT protocol were contacted privately and disclosed the vulnerability before the public announcement. The Veil project has been contacted but found not to be vulnerable due to a different implementation. The Ghost project, on the other hand, has been found to be vulnerable but has swiftly patched the vulnerability. We’d like to thank both teams for their support and urgency in addressing the situation.</li></ul><h1 id=\"particl-v3-update\">Particl V3 Update</h1><p>It can be reported that a significant slow down has been observed in the finalization of Particl V3 in the past few weeks due to personal issues that led to a strain in time availability. This is in the process of being resolved and we expect the development of Particl V3 and Particl Desktop to resume at its usual pace (and, more likely, at a faster pace than it used to) in the next few days.</p><p>For this reason, we do not have any specific update on Particl V3 for the moment, but we fully expect to have a report ready to go live before the next Project Update in April. We also expect the new testnet version to go live before that time.</p><p>To understand a bit more where things are headed for Particl and how the project is about to get back full steam ahead, carefully read the next section.</p><h1 id=\"a-proposal-for-an-improved-and-more-sustainable-treasury-model\">A Proposal for an Improved and More Sustainable Treasury Model</h1><p>As <strong><a href=\"https://particl.foundation/foundation-announcement\">it was communicated a few months ago</a></strong>, the Particl Foundation has paid all outstanding payments to its contractors (which includes developers). This necessary action (due to agreed commitments with said contractors) has severely depleted the Foundation’s reserves <strong>leading it to initiate its shutdown process</strong>.</p><p>As a result, the Particl team had to pause salaries until a new funding solution appeared, which caused the project to temporarily go back to a voluntary-based contribution model. This has, unfortunately, led to a considerable reduction in time availability for most of the team members due to other temporary commitments needed to be made to make ends meet.</p><p>Additionally, the looming release of Particl V3, which is arguably the biggest Particl release ever since the project’s inception, is right around the corner with only a few changes needed to be applied for it to go live on mainnet. The problem? The team doesn’t have access to proper funding anymore to promote it at its just value and give it the exposure it deserves. This situation, combined with the voluntary-basis contribution model that is in play, motivated the team to work on a creative but effective solution to get the project funded once again and be back in action full steam ahead.</p><h3 id=\"a-new-and-improved-treasury-model\">A New and Improved Treasury Model</h3><p>For the reasons mentioned above, and to ensure the proper development and effective promotion of the project in the many years to come, <strong>the team has been working relentlessly on a new, more robust treasury model which would guarantee enough funding to support the project</strong>. This would ultimately provide the project with just as much financial support as the project had at its peak and eventually surpass this level.</p><p>The new treasury model being designed doesn’t aim at reinventing the wheel. At current PART prices, self-sustainability can be achieved by tweaking the current treasury model which, at this moment, reserves 10% of all the staking rewards to support the project. The Particl team is modelling the new treasury figures after that of very successful and top-rated projects in the space such as Decred, Siacoin, and others which have adopted similar self-funding strategy. Doing so has proven to be an overwhelming and indisputable success for these projects.</p><h3 id=\"what-to-expect\">What to Expect?</h3><p>While the numbers around the new treasury model are still being simulated and evaluated, this would allow for the <strong>immediate full funding of the Particl team at current PART prices</strong> and would provide enough funds to reserve in various budgets aimed at supporting and promoting the project as well as stimulate user growth.</p><p>As the treasury model is based on PART staking, <strong>an increase in PART prices would directly translate to a more significant source of funding for the project</strong> which could, eventually, be used to expand the team with new members (developers and non-developers), fund campaigns (i.e. marketing, user growth, etc), fund promotional efforts, and fund various budgets such as exchange listings, just as an example. This model has, in fact, exponential potential.</p><p>Of course, before any expansion process beings, the first step is to fire up the engine once again and stabilize the new Particl internal structure. A team expansion is a time-consuming process with various considerations and thus, is planned for when the time will be suitable for it.</p><p>As a result of this new source of funding, you can expect the Particl project to be back in the midst of action and be as strong, and even stronger, as it was at its peak. You can also expect a much faster pace of development, more frequent communication, more transparency, more promotional efforts, more marketing, more user growth/adoption initiatives, and so on. This is the key to ensure Particl’s success not only this year but in the many years that stand ahead of us all.</p><h3 id=\"submitted-as-a-ccs-proposal\">Submitted as a CCS Proposal</h3><p>The team is currently implementing a better UI for the on-chain voting system in the CCS system and it should go live in a week or two. That’ll allow you to better visualize the proposals, current voting, and etc.</p><p>Because this new treasury model changes the values of the yearly staking interest rate as well as the percentage of all staking rewards being reserved for the development and promotion of the Particl project, community consensus has to be achieved at the protocol level to ensure an optimal level of decentralization.</p><p>Another important point is that all the block rewards going to the treasury fund will require an on-chain vote to be spent. <strong>Every quarter, the Particl team will submit a CCS proposal to have its budget approved by the community using on-chain voting</strong>. This ultimately gives the community the final say, furthers the level of decentralization of the project (and its governance), and keeps the team accountable to every PART holder to ensure it always acts in the best interest of the ecosystem.</p><h3 id=\"full-details-coming-in-a-separate-blog-post\">Full Details Coming in a Separate Blog Post</h3><p>Just like with the information surrounding the proposed solutions for the inflationary bug, the precise details, figures, and in-depth information about the treasury model proposal will be posted in a separate blog post that is likely to go out next week on Particl News. Stay tuned as the team is in the process of finalizing all the details!</p><h1 id=\"atomic-swaps-are-coming-to-particl-desktop\">Atomic Swaps are Coming to Particl Desktop</h1><p>But wait, there’s more being worked on! Over the past few months, a great surprise has been cooking up and is now ready to be revealed; <strong>atomic swaps are coming right to Particl Desktop</strong> thanks to a new Particl-based distributed exchange protocol.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/iCZmpgHaL6wdVopywgrA_bOSf9iZZc4X44sMLN2psut7LLsa9cFSySY9YTCRz-FHD5NWrorngtzk-gxtg6UzUwHz3c_wKfRa7PGOm9YhOju54KDzDI9OumaLuFx4J8ibTlteZFcS\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><em>Early Design of the BasicSwap-Powered Swap Module on Particl V3 (WIP)</em></figcaption></figure><p>In fact, Particl Core Developer Tecnovert has been working on <em>BasicSwap</em>, an <strong>anonymous DEX protocol that uses SMSG to allow people to swap, without any third-party, cryptocurrencies using atomic swaps</strong>. BasicSwap is currently functional and is in its Closed Beta phase where various testers have been experimenting with it for a few weeks. This anonymous DEX protocol, which <strong>currently supports Particl, Monero, Bitcoin, and Litecoin</strong>, has many benefits that will go a long way in making PART and other cryptocurrencies more resilient and widely accessible to all.</p><p>It uses Particl’s SMSG P2P network and the atomic swap protocol to allow you to exchange cryptocurrencies without requiring a third-party or wrapped assets. The swaps are pretty fast; in fact, swapping PART for LTC averages 20 to 25 minutes per swap (after both transactions are fully confirmed), which is also the same for PART/XMR swaps. Of course, the actual time required for a swap to fully complete is entirely dependent on the confirmation times of the two coins being traded.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/R4iVnjkuTJLCC2feoqXc4qtc6MrJpVLqN3ELXtJBo1GmQT_2zwR7LvAY6I4fZ-NmL2-dryqYKYq2vgstKhLr556aAxr1w-6nqQEkb_NwStpaFphMoPORWRLcuzpfRj-EFwKsKQ8x\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><em>Completed Mainnet Swaps Using the BasicSwap Back-End (Mainnet)</em></figcaption></figure><p>To make it as easy to use as possible, <strong>the BasicSwap protocol will eventually be integrated into the user interface of Particl Desktop</strong>. Swapping cryptocurrencies will be possible through a new Particl V3 “Swap” module and won’t require the syncing of other coin nodes.</p><p>This new atomic swap module isn’t planned to be released with the initial mainnet launch of Particl V3 but is expected to go live in one of the subsequent few Particl Desktop updates that come after it. Even though this project is currently being delayed due to the commitment required from Particl Core Developer Tecnovert to fix the inflationary bug, BasicSwap is fully expected to be accelerated by the potential funding provided by the new treasury model.</p><p>Keep an eye out for an announcement of an Open Beta as well as more information about this tool as soon as the Particl developers can get back to working on their previous tasks after the inflationary bug is dealt with. That should come shortly after the release of Particl V3 on mainnet.</p><h1 id=\"new-ccs-proposal\">New CCS Proposal</h1><p>A few weeks ago, a new proposal was added to the CCS system. Authored by Particl community member ffmad, it proposes to fund the development and creation of a <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-market\">market API</a> (Particl V3) documentation. This proposal seeks to help anyone set up a market node and use it just like DeMarkets.io did with the explorer for Particl V2.</p><p>The requested donations are on the low end (1,200 PART), so if you’d like to contribute, check out the proposal on the CCS <strong><a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io/\">here</a>.</strong></p><blockquote><em><strong>Note: </strong>The Particl node of the CCS will be updated next week, after which previous proposals will be updated. This will also move this proposal from the Idea stage into the Funding Required stage.</em></blockquote><h1 id=\"particl-ends-2020-strongly-in-global-github-commit-rankings\">Particl Ends 2020 Strongly in Global Github Commit Rankings</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://www.cryptomiso.com/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">CryptoMiso - Ranking cryptocurrencies based on Github commits</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">CryptoMiso is a web service ranking cryptocurrencies based on the commit history of their most popular Github repository.</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">CryptoMiso</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">Bart Claeys</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://www.cryptomiso.com/assets/miso_fbshare.png\"></div></a></figure><p>The Year 2020 has been a different one than previous years for the Particl project. This is primarily because Particl kept most of its development in private repositories as the team was working on the Particl V3 massive update. This meant that only a tiny percentage of the progress was able to be publicly tracked on Github. Regardless, being a Bitcoin fork has many benefits for Particl, an obvious one being that it effectively leverages the entire development community of Bitcoin.</p><p>In fact, Particl Core Developer Tecnovert constantly keeps the Particl code up-to-date with Bitcoin’s codebase. That means regularly pulling Bitcoin updates, modifying the code to make it Particl compatible, and merging it without breaking anything else. This is obviously no small task, and this is reflected in CryptoMiso’s yearly Github commit leaderboard (2020), where Particl ranked 4th in terms of the number of commits for the whole year! Particl currently ranks 5th in the past 12 months, and that doesn’t even take into account the development made to the private repositories of Particl Desktop and the BasicSwap DEX protocol.</p><hr><h1 id=\"the-best-is-yet-to-come\">The Best is Yet to Come</h1><p>Although Particl is going through an unfortunate situation at this moment, it’s also about to turn it into the best and most productive event since the inception of the project itself with the proposed new treasury model.</p><p>We understand that the current times can be challenging, but rest assured that the best is yet to come! The team’s getting ready to fire up the engine full steam ahead once again, scale back up, properly promote the project and its products, and come back into the midst of action with a strong bang!</p><p>It’s definitive. Things are looking very good in 2021 and the many years that come after it!

been updated.\nAs you are probably aware, the Particl team has proceeded with an emergency\nhardfork on Thursday the 25th of February, 2021, that temporarily disabled\nRingCT and CT transactions to fix a critical vulnerability in the code. This\nannouncement will disclose the nature of the vulnerability and provide\npreliminary details surrounding the event.\n\nEmergency Hard Fork AnnouncementThe Particl team has found a critical issue in\nthe RingCT and CT code which requires a hardfork. Please update your Particl\nCore nodes immediately.cryptoguardBlog\n[https://particl.news/emergency-hardfork-announcement/]Above all, if you haven’t\nalready done so, please urgently download the new Particl Core (Particl Core\n0.19.2.5 [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.5])\nclient which can be found here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.5]. If you run a\ncold staking node, please update it immediately by typing the partyman update \ncommand. If you use the Particl Desktop client, launch it as soon as possible so\nthat it can automatically be updated with the new Particl Core version. If it's\nalready opened up, please shut it down completely and restart it.\n\n> Note: Trading on exchanges will be safe to resume after updating their nodes to\nParticl Core 0.19.2.5.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Contents\n * What Happened?\n * How Did This Happen?\n * The Solution\n * Investigating the Attack\n * FAQ and our Commitment to Transparency\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat Happened?\nOn the 20th of February, 2021, a significant discrepancy between the expected\nand real supply of Particl was observed and confirmed. This prompted the team to\nhastily look into the source of this discrepancy, which led to the discovery of\na critical vulnerability that allowed coins to be anonymously created by\ndefeating the verification code of plain-to-anon transactions. It can be\nconfirmed that this vulnerability has been exploited by a malicious party which\nled to the creation of an unknown number of anon coins. It can also be confirmed\nthat at least 768,767 exploited PART coins have been successfully transferred\nfrom anon to public balances since the beginning of the attack, according to\ntraces on the blockchain.\n\nThe vulnerability is now fully fixed and cannot be exploited anymore as of the\nrelease of Particl Core 0.19.2.4.\n\nHow Did This Happen?\nUnderstanding the vulnerability requires one to be aware of the two issues in\nthe code which led to it.\n\nThe first and main issue is located in the verification code of plain-to-anon\ntransactions. It caused the commitment sum not to verify when sending coins from\npublic balances to anon ones. This means an attacker can pick his own made-up\noutput values, which aren’t required to sum to the amount of the inputs used.\nThis vulnerability was located here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/cb12ae91f6a84df44e2aa0e73780fee5085491ac/src/consensus/tx_verify.cpp#L342] \nin Particl’s code and has now been patched.\n\nAdditionally, a related issue was discovered that prevented the blind sum from\nbeing set when sending PART coins from public to anon balances. This means that\nall public to anon values would fail the commitment sum check even if their\ninputs and outputs summed. For this reason, it isn't easy to determine, with\nabsolute certainty, which RingCT transactions were exploited and which ones are\nlegitimate. In this case, any anon output or blinded output descending from an\nanon output could, in theory, be holding millions of illegitimate PART coins.\nThis vulnerability is located here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/cb12ae91f6a84df44e2aa0e73780fee5085491ac/src/wallet/hdwallet.cpp#L3836] \nin Particl’s code and has been patched as well.\n\nAt the time of this writing, and since July 2019, it is confirmed that at least\n768,767 exploited PART coins have been successfully transferred from anon\nbalances to public ones. As per the nature of the RingCT privacy protocol, it is\nunclear exactly how many anon coins were created in total or remain in anon\noutputs. Still, the Particl team is continuing its investigation. Any additional\ncoin added to this estimate would be the total number of legitimate PART coins\nthe community holds in anon balances.\n\nBe assured; the Particl team is in the process of determining the new supply and\npreventing any remaining exploited coins from being transacted. Once the\ninvestigation concludes, the total circulating supply of Particl will be\nadjusted to its new, post-inflationary bug value with full certainty,\neffectively restoring the chain’s integrity.\n\n> Note: Although the protocol, cryptography, and libraries of the RingCT and\nBulletproofs protocols have been thoroughly audited by the renowned Quarkslab\nsecurity firm, the specific portion of the code that was exploited, which is its\nimplementation, didn’t fall under the scope of their audit or mandate.\nThe Solution\nThe solution to address this attack and restore the blockchain’s integrity can\nbe separated into two specific objectives.\n\n * Fix the vulnerability to prevent exploited coins from being created and\n   transacted. (SUCCESS)\n * Re-enable anon and blind transactions but permanently block exploited anon\n   coins (IN PROGRESS)\n\nTo complete both of these objectives, the Particl team has pushed forward a\ncontingency plan that requires two hardforks.\n\nHardfork 1\nThe first hardfork, which has been successful already, fixed the vulnerabilities\nto prevent more coins from being created. It also temporarily disabled RingCT\nand CT transactions on the Particl network, preventing anon and blind coins from\nbeing transacted. This made it impossible for the attacker to convert more\nexploited anon coins into public balances, effectively putting a full stop to\nthe attack.\n\nThe new client to make this hardfork happen (Particl Core 0.19.2.4\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.4]) has already\nbeen pushed out publicly, but a new version (Particl Core 0.19.2.5\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.5]) has been\nreleased a few days after. Particl Core 0.19.2.5 introduces a checksum mark\npreventing any rollbacks and permanently invalidating the old chain to get ready\nfor the second hardfork.\n\nIf you haven't updated yet, it is essential that you immediately do so by\ninstalling the new Particl Core version\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.5] or, at the very\nleast, the 0.19.2.4 version.\n\nHardfork 2\nThe second hardfork aims at restoring full RingCT and CT functionalities as well\nas restoring the integrity of the chain by disallowing exploited anon outputs\nfrom being used in the future but allowing legitimate ones. The conclusion of\nthe second hardfork will also confirm the newly adjusted supply of the Particl\nblockchain and adjust it to its true post-inflation value.\n\nOnce this hardfork is completed, it will let you privately transact with other\npeople once again, including when using the Particl Marketplace. To ensure that\nno exploited coins can be used post-hardfork, all the anon and blind outputs\noriginating from before the hardfork will be frozen. It’ll then be possible for\nlegitimate users to unfreeze them by going through a series of manual steps to\nprove their legitimacy.\n\nThe Particl team is currently evaluating various strategies to “whitelist” these\nlegitimate outputs while keeping exploited ones unusable. These strategies vary\nin impact, intrusiveness, and level of complexities, but each has its pros and\ncons.\n\nWhile they are not yet ready to be announced, the team will present to the\ncommunity its game plan as soon as possible. We would like to request additional\ntime to ensure all the necessary data is collected and that the strategies are\nas efficient as they can be. Thank you for your patience and support!\n\n> Note: The second hardfork will also include a few other minor improvements and\nchanges the team had been looking into adding for a while now, some being\nunrelated to this particular exploit event. The full changelog will be available\non the new client’s Github release page.\n> Note 2: The second hardfork will reveal the new inflated supply of the Particl\nblockchain. As a side effect, please take note that this will cause staking\nrewards to increase proportionally to how much the circulating supply has\ninflated.\nInvestigating the Attack\nSince the day of the hardfork, the Particl team has been collecting data and\ncollaborating with exchanges to determine whether the attacker can be identified\nand whether he still holds coins on there. However, due to the nature of RingCT,\nit may be impossible, with total certainty, to come to definitive conclusions.\nIn any case, the investigation continues, but the findings can not yet be\ndisclosed publicly. We will keep you informed as soon as possible.\n\nIf you believe that you’ve tracked suspicious activity on the blockchain, you\ncan submit your findings to Cryptoguard, which will then relay the information\nto the rest of the team for the investigation. We appreciate every bit of help\nand would like to thank everyone who participates in this effort.\n\n> Note: Trading on exchanges will be safe to resume after updating their nodes to\nParticl Core 0.19.2.5.\nFAQ and our Commitment to Transparency\nWe understand that you may have questions related to this announcement; we are\nhere to help! The Particl team is committed to full transparency and user\nsupport through this evolving situation. \n\nTo that end, we will publish a follow-up blog post later on that will contain\nmore data and up-to-date information about the attack as we gather it.\n\nFrom that point, the team will then hold an FAQ session on our sub-Reddit to\nanswer any remaining questions. Cryptoguard will be available for answers with\nsupport from the Particl Core developers. This thread will be pinned on\nParticl's sub-Reddit and serve as the go-to FAQ resource for people with\nquestions about this event.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank You!\nWe want to thank you for your support and patience as we work on collecting more\ndata, preparing for the second hardfork, and building the tools required to\nvalidate legitimate anon outputs. As this is an evolving situation, the Particl\nteam will keep you informed as more information is gathered, so keep an eye out\nfor any new blog post on Particl News!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This prompted the team to hastily look into the source of this discrepancy, which led to the discovery of a critical vulnerability that allowed coins to be anonymously created by defeating the verification code of plain-to-anon transactions. It can be confirmed that this vulnerability has been exploited by a malicious party which led to the creation of an unknown number of anon coins. <strong>It can also be confirmed that at least 768,767 exploited PART coins have been successfully transferred from anon to public balances since the beginning of the attack</strong>, according to traces on the blockchain.</p><p>The vulnerability is now fully fixed and cannot be exploited anymore as of the release of Particl Core 0.19.2.4.</p><h1 id=\"how-did-this-happen\">How Did This Happen?</h1><p>Understanding the vulnerability requires one to be aware of the two issues in the code which led to it.</p><p>The first and main issue is located in the verification code of plain-to-anon transactions. <strong>It caused the commitment sum not to verify when sending coins from public balances to anon ones</strong>. This means an attacker can pick his own made-up output values, which aren’t required to sum to the amount of the inputs used. This vulnerability was located <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/cb12ae91f6a84df44e2aa0e73780fee5085491ac/src/consensus/tx_verify.cpp#L342\"><strong>here</strong></a> in Particl’s code and has now been patched.</p><p>Additionally, a related issue was discovered that <strong>prevented the blind sum from being set when sending PART coins from public to anon balances</strong>. This means that all public to anon values would fail the commitment sum check even if their inputs and outputs summed. For this reason, it isn't easy to determine, with absolute certainty, which RingCT transactions were exploited and which ones are legitimate. In this case, any anon output or blinded output descending from an anon output could, in theory, be holding millions of illegitimate PART coins. This vulnerability is located <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/blob/cb12ae91f6a84df44e2aa0e73780fee5085491ac/src/wallet/hdwallet.cpp#L3836\"><strong>here</strong></a> in Particl’s code and has been patched as well.</p><p>At the time of this writing, and since July 2019, it is confirmed that <strong>at least 768,767 exploited PART coins have been successfully transferred from anon balances to public ones</strong>. As per the nature of the RingCT privacy protocol, it is unclear exactly how many anon coins were created in total or remain in anon outputs. Still, the Particl team is continuing its investigation. <strong><strong>Any additional coin added to this estimate would be the total number of</strong> legitimate<strong> PART coins the community holds in anon balances.</strong></strong></p><p>Be assured; the Particl team is in the process of determining the new supply and preventing any remaining exploited coins from being transacted. Once the investigation concludes, the total circulating supply of Particl will be adjusted to its new, post-inflationary bug value with full certainty, effectively restoring the chain’s integrity.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> Although the protocol, cryptography, and libraries of the RingCT and Bulletproofs protocols have been thoroughly audited by the renowned Quarkslab security firm, the specific portion of the code that was exploited, which is its implementation, didn’t fall under the scope of their audit or mandate.</em></blockquote><h1 id=\"the-solution\">The Solution</h1><p>The solution to address this attack and restore the blockchain’s integrity can be separated into two specific objectives.</p><ul><li>Fix the vulnerability to prevent exploited coins from being created and transacted. (SUCCESS)</li><li>Re-enable anon and blind transactions but permanently block exploited anon coins (IN PROGRESS)</li></ul><p>To complete both of these objectives, the Particl team has pushed forward a contingency plan that requires two hardforks.</p><h3 id=\"hardfork-1\">Hardfork 1</h3><p>The first hardfork, which has been successful already, <strong>fixed the vulnerabilities to prevent more coins from being created. It also temporarily disabled RingCT and CT transactions</strong> on the Particl network, preventing anon and blind coins from being transacted. This made it impossible for the attacker to convert more exploited anon coins into public balances, effectively putting a full stop to the attack.</p><p>The new client to make this hardfork happen (<strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.4\">Particl Core 0.19.2.4</a></strong>) has already been pushed out publicly, but a new version (<strong><a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.5\">Particl Core 0.19.2.5</a></strong>) has been released a few days after. Particl Core 0.19.2.5 introduces a checksum mark preventing any rollbacks and permanently invalidating the old chain to get ready for the second hardfork.</p><p>If you haven't updated yet, it is essential that you immediately do so by installing <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.5\"><strong>the new Particl Core version</strong></a><strong> </strong>or, at the very least, the 0.19.2.4 version.</p><h3 id=\"hardfork-2\">Hardfork 2</h3><p>The second hardfork aims at <strong>restoring full RingCT and CT functionalities</strong> as well as restoring the integrity of the chain by <strong>disallowing exploited anon outputs from being used in the future but allowing legitimate ones</strong>. The conclusion of the second hardfork will also confirm the newly adjusted supply of the Particl blockchain and adjust it to its true post-inflation value.</p><p>Once this hardfork is completed, it will let you privately transact with other people once again, including when using the Particl Marketplace. To ensure that no exploited coins can be used post-hardfork, all the anon and blind outputs originating from before the hardfork will be frozen. It’ll then be possible for legitimate users to unfreeze them by going through a series of manual steps to prove their legitimacy.</p><p>The Particl team is currently evaluating various strategies to “whitelist” these legitimate outputs while keeping exploited ones unusable. These strategies vary in impact, intrusiveness, and level of complexities, but each has its pros and cons.</p><p>While they are not yet ready to be announced, the team will present to the community its game plan as soon as possible. We would like to request additional time to ensure all the necessary data is collected and that the strategies are as efficient as they can be. Thank you for your patience and support!</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> The second hardfork will also include a few other minor improvements and changes the team had been looking into adding for a while now, some being unrelated to this particular exploit event. The full changelog will be available on the new client’s Github release page.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em><strong>Note 2:</strong> The second hardfork will reveal the new inflated supply of the Particl blockchain. As a side effect, please take note that this will cause staking rewards to increase proportionally to how much the circulating supply has inflated.</em></blockquote><h1 id=\"investigating-the-attack\">Investigating the Attack</h1><p>Since the day of the hardfork, the Particl team has been collecting data and collaborating with exchanges to determine whether the attacker can be identified and whether he still holds coins on there. However, due to the nature of RingCT, it may be impossible, with total certainty, to come to definitive conclusions. In any case, the investigation continues, but the findings can not yet be disclosed publicly. We will keep you informed as soon as possible.</p><p>If you believe that you’ve tracked suspicious activity on the blockchain, you can submit your findings to Cryptoguard, which will then relay the information to the rest of the team for the investigation.

Although there isn’t a ton of new stuff to report,\npartly due to a well-deserved break the developers took during the holidays,\ngood progress has been made on several fronts.\n\nLet’s get down to the details of it!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNew Particl Core Releases\nAs mentioned recently, Particl Core developer Tecnovert has been ramping up\ndevelopment in various areas, notably in keeping Particl Core up-to-date with\nBitcoin’s codebase. As we walk through 2021, you can expect core elements and\nupdates to be more frequent than they have been in the past year or so.\n\nTo that end, two new core releases were published as pre-releases this month;\nParticl Core 0.19.2.3 and Particl Core 0.21.0.1.\n\nToday, on the 28th of January, 2021, Particl Core 0.19.2.3 has been fully\nreleased [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.3] and\nhas exited its pre-release phase.\n\nParticl Core 0.19.2.3\n * Download: https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.3\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.19.2.3]\n\nThe new Particl Core 0.19.2.3 full release is mostly composed of minor bug fixes\nand improvements. It also re-introduces 32bit builds for Windows, which has now\nbeen abandoned by Bitcoin, making Particl accessible to an even wider range of\nusers across the globe. This lets users with less powerful or more dated\ncomputers access Particl Core and Particl Marketplace in less technically\nequipped environments. The full changelog is as follows:\n\n * Merged Bitcoin 0.19.2 backports.\n * New PoW checkpoints.\n * Fix smsginbox hex encoding bug.\n * Tighten IsStandard() check to fail on trailing script.\n * Re-enable win32 gitian build.\n\nParticl Core 0.21.0.1\n * Download: https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.0.1\n   [https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.0.1]\n\nThe Particl Core 0.21.0.1 is a much bigger release compared to the 0.19.2.3 one.\nIt’s the first significant core update since the 4th of December, 2019, and it\nincludes a vast number of improvements derived from Bitcoin Core 0.20 and 0.21.\nHere are some of the most noteworthy.\n\n * New RPC call to easily create and share a secure blockchain snapshot that\n   allows you to start using the blockchain while it hasn’t fully synced yet.\n * Asmap functionality\n   [https://cryptooof.com/bitcoin-core-brings-asmap-as-an-antidote-to-erebus-attack/] \n   for more reliable and decentralized network connectivity.\n * Tor V3 support\n   [https://decrypt.co/44640/bitcoins-next-upgrade-will-support-tor-v3-addresses] \n   for better network privacy. Tor will deprecate V2 addresses in the next year\n   or two, making this a critical update to Particl Core.\n * Schnorr signatures\n   [https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/the-power-of-schnorr-the-signature-algorithm-to-increase-bitcoin-s-scale-and-privacy-1460642496] \n   and Taproot\n   [https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/taproot-coming-what-it-and-how-it-will-benefit-bitcoin] \n   readiness for more privacy and scalability. This has yet to be activated,\n   however, but Particl Core is now ready for it.\n * No default wallet created when launching Particl Core for the first time.\n * “Compact client-side block filtering” for more privacy-friendly light\n   wallets.\n * Various issue and bug fixes as well as general improvements that operate more\n   in the background\n\nParticl Core 0.21.0.1 is published as a pre-release, meaning it still requires a\nmore extensive period of testing across different environments before being\ndeployed as a full release. As has been the tradition with Particl, this is to\nensure the stability and security of this new release. Once it gets fully\nreleased, Particl Core 0.21.0.1 will then supercede Particl Core 0.19.2.3.\n\nIf you find any issue with Particl Core 0.21.0.1, please report them directly to \nParticl’s particl-core Github issue page\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/issues].\n\nParticl V3\nParticl V3, which includes the new Particl Desktop client and the improved\nmarketplace codebase, has progressed well. Here are the current two areas that\nare still being worked on.\n\n * Fixing minor bugs and issues identified by the community during the testing\n   round for the first testnet build.\n * Fixing a more extensive problem related to Windows builds prevents some users\n   from launching the application normally.\n\nAlthough the minor bugs and issues are expected to be fixed quickly, the Windows\nissue is a more complicated one, requiring much more effort. A new testnet build\nof Particl V3 will likely be released very shortly, but it may not yet include\nthe fix for the Windows issue.\n\nThis would give the opportunity to the community to, once again, test out the\nbuild and make sure no new issue has appeared as a result of the various fixes\nthat are being implemented. And then, once the Windows issue is fixed, a new\ntestnet build will be immediately published. If no new problem arises after this\npoint, Particl V3 will then be ready to immediately initiate its move towards\nmainnet.\n\nParticl Academy\nThe Particl Academy is nearing completion and is still scheduled for release\nbefore the Particl V3 mainnet. Take note that, following Particl’s ethos, the\nentire Particl Academy platform will be open-sourced on Github. That’ll allow\nanyone in the community to contribute with content, propose changes, or improve\nany aspect.\n\nCCS System\nThere are two important topics worth mentioning regarding the CCS proposal\nsystem.\n\nFirst off, a major proposal was pushed roughly one month ago and has raised\napproximately 65% of its target with 29 participants contributing! It suggests\nseeding the marketplace with thousands of real items that will be able to be\nanonymously purchased. The entire buying process for these items will be\nautomated, meaning a swift and smooth user experience.\n\nTo support this initiative, please feel free to donate to the proposal by\nfollowing this link\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html].\n\nSeeding Items to the MarketplaceLudx and Cryptoguard\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html]Secondly,\nthe Particl team has started preparing, code-wise and logistically, to integrate\nthe new on-chain voting module into the CCS system. This will let community\nmembers push proposals that may require a consensus to be reached. Such\nproposals can include protocol changes, Community Fund movement, etc.\n\nMore details will be provided shortly about the consensus requirements (what is\nneeded for a proposal to be deemed as “having reached consensus”) as well as the\non-chain voting system in general and its expected time of arrival.\n\nParticl.News Translations\nA while ago, valuable Particl community members started translating key blog\nposts. However, due to the limitative nature of Medium, they couldn’t be\nproperly displayed on Particl.News. This has now changed with Particl’s blog\nmigration from Medium to Ghost.\n\nTranslated articles are now being published on Particl News\n[https://particl.news]! These translated articles do not show up, by default, on\nthe blog’s main page but can be easily accessed by clicking the right language\nflag at the top right corner of the screen.\n\nAs translations are a big part of making Particl accessible to the global\ncommunity, we’d like to thank all these contributors for their hard work in\ntranslating these articles. They are WhiteFlag (Spanish), Laurogripa \n(Portuguese), Mbacoinin and Stock999 (Russian), and Anonymouser (Philippines)!\n\nIf you would like to contribute to Particl and help out translating content into\nyour native language, please reach out on Particl’s Discord server or Telegram\nchannels. We’ll be happy to see with you what content is the most important to\ntranslate and publish your work on Particl News [https://particl.news].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Needs YOU!\nAs we now find ourselves on the verge of going live with the second testing\nround of Particl v3, Particl needs your help! So get your machines ready so that\nwe can all blast through this new testing round ensuring a fast, but secure,\nmigration towards mainnet. \n\nIn the meantime, you can be of crucial help by testing out the new Particl Core\n0.21.0.1 release. Testing it across many different environments (operating\nsystems, hardware setups, etc) helps picking up potential issues more\neffectively and moving forward more effectively.\n\nAs always, the entire Particl team would like to warmly thank you for your\ncontinued support through the years so far. Let's, together, make 2021 a great\nyear for Particl and the world of decentralized e-commerce in general!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

These are the releases of Particl Core 0.19.2.3 (pre-release, mainnet)\nand Particl Core 0.21.0.1 (pre-release, mainnet).\n\nIt is now possible to download these releases by navigating to Particl’s \nparticl-core repository on Github\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases].

It also re-introduces 32bit builds for Windows, which has now\nbeen abandoned by Bitcoin. This lets users with less powerful or more dated\ncomputers run Particl Core without issues. The full changelog is as follows:\n\n * Merged Bitcoin 0.19.2 backports.\n * New checkpoints.\n * Fix smsginbox hex encoding bug.\n * Tighten IsStandard() check to fail on trailing script.\n * Re-enable win32 gitian build.\n\nParticl Core 0.19.2.3 will soon follow with a full release after a more\nextensive period of testing.

It is, nonetheless, available on mainnet and\ncan be used with Particl-Qt and the CLI client. It brings Particl back to par\nwith Bitcoin’s latest version (0.21) and includes all the recent changes made to\nBitcoin’s code since the last update.\n\nAs Bitcoin Core 0.21 has been released a few days ago\n[https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-core-0-21-0-released-whats-new],\nParticl Core 0.21 will soon follow with a full release after a more extensive\nperiod of testing.

For this reason, this is an important update and is\nrecommended for the advanced users who prefer using the more lightweight\nParticl-Qt client. It is also recommended for those using CLI or interacting\ndirectly with the Particl daemon (i.e., if you are working on a Particl\napplication or writing scripts).\n\nNotes on 0.21.0.1:\n * A default wallet is no longer created or loaded.\n * SQLite backed wallets and multi-process binaries are not converted.\n\nYou can download this pre-release directly on Github by following this link.\n\nRelease Particl Core 0.21.0.1 · particl/particl-coreRelease\nNotes:https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/blob/0.21/doc/release-notes-particl.md#02101\nA default wallet is no longer created or loaded.Sqlite backed wallets and\nmultiprocess binari...particlGitHub\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-core/releases/tag/v0.21.0.1]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo catch these releases as soon as they go live, you can follow the \nparticl-core\nrepository on Github [https://github.com/particl/particl-core].

We need your help\nto pick bug, issues, and find improvements!\n\nKeep in mind that, due to the large number of core changes this update\nintroduces, this release is incompatible with previous Particl Desktop data like\nlistings, orders, and your previous market database. That means you’ll have to\nreset your Particl-Market/testnet folder so that it works correctly.\n\nFollow this link [https://particl.news/particl-v3-now-available-on-testnet/] to\nget all the instructions on how to install and start Particl V3-testnet.\n\nParticl V3 Released on Testnet | Test Decentralized and Anonymous Marketplace\nParticl V3-testnet has just been released! New decentralized and anonymous\nmarketplace. Buy and sell anything online without leaving a digital footprint.\ncryptoguardParticl News Blog\n[https://particl.news/particl-v3-now-available-on-testnet/]Particl V3\nDevelopment Update\nThroughout December, a Particl V3-testnet build has been released to a limited\nnumber of community members. They have helped a lot testing the new V3 builds\nand identifying bugs and issues.\n\nAs a result, a few minor issues have been picked up, reported, and fixed. None\nof these issues were breaking bugs but rather improvements or quick to fix bugs.\nThe team has been busy preparing the release and making sure that it’s first\npublic testnet release would be as smooth as possible.\n\nTesting Guidelines\nWith Particl V3-testnet live and going, now’s the time to test it out as much as\npossible. The goal here is to try to break it or make it behave unexpectedly. In\nfact, this testing phase is all about finding any edge case that may lead to\nproblems once deployed on mainnet.\n\nTo properly report issues when testing Particl V3-testnet, click the bug icon at\nthe bottom left corner of Particl Desktop and create a Github issue describing,\nin detail, the problem you’ve encountered.\n\nAdditionally, you can join the Particl Community forum’s Marketplace Testing\ncategory [https://particl.community/category/16/marketplace-testing] to discuss\nissues, ask questions, and find other Particl community members to test the\nmarketplace and make test orders.\n\nWork on Atomic Swap Continues\nParticl cryptographer Tecnovert has continued his work on atomic swaps so that\nthey can be integrated into Particl Desktop. This will go a long way in\nimproving PART's accessibility for all, including in the USA, and make the\nParticl platform more resilient to outside influence.\n\nOf course, atomic swaps between Particl and coins like Bitcoin, Litecoin,\nMonero, Decred, and others are already possible, but they're generally\nunintuitive. That’s because atomic swaps need, at least for the moment, to be\nmanually executed. That means two swappers need to manually find each other,\nagree to what currencies they want to exchange, at what rate, and at what time.\nDuring the swap, they also need to manually exchange multiple “swap files”\neither through email, instant messaging, or other means of communication. In\nother words, the process of completing an atomic swap is currently tedious and\nfull of friction.\n\nTo fix those issues, Tecnovert has been working on a solution to fully automate\nall the steps and requirements to make an atomic swap. This solution, which can\nin many ways be likened to a DEX (decentralized exchange), is intended to be\nintegrated into Particl Desktop once it’s ready for deployment.\n\nThat’ll allow anyone, anywhere in the world, to easily buy and sell PART without\nhaving to quit the Particl Desktop client. This integration won’t require any\nthird-party, no account, no KYC, and won’t impose any limitation on the number\nof coins allowed to be traded.\n\nThere is currently no ETA on this item. It’s a pretty complex and bleeding-edge\nchallenge filled with unexpected setbacks and bumps. There is, after all, a\nreason why there are very few DEXes that are 100% decentralized. This is going\nto be a significant area of focus for Tecnovert going into 2021. More details\nwill be shared as we progress further.\n\nParticl.News is now on a Jamstack\nIt’s finally done, Particl.News is now officially hosted on GitHub Pages. The\neditor’s interface is delivered by Ghost (the blog ??), and everything is\nglued together by Gatsby! This new way of hosting the blog provides the project\nwith much more autonomy, a more tailored experience for the audience, easy to\nfind translations, complete control over the website, and zero unnecessary noise\nor third-party branding for you.\n\nIf you’re reading this blog post, then you’re already on the \"Jamstack\"!\n\nThe Particl Academy is About to Go Live\nThe internal testnet builds the team has had for the past few weeks have allowed\na lot of work to be put into the Particl Academy. It’s been completely updated\nwith all the recent information, tutorials, guides, and in-depth articles\nrequired to support the Particl V3 release.\n\nYou can expect the Particl Academy to drop somewhere during the current testing\nphase of Particl V3-testnet and before the mainnet release.\n\nNew CCS Proposal to Support the V3 Mainnet Release\nOn the 3rd of December, a new key proposal has been suggested on the CCS system.\nThis proposal aims at seeding the Particl Marketplace with thousands of listings\nto support the mainnet release of Particl V3.\n\nThis initiative aims to address the chicken and egg problem that each\nmarketplace faces when launching and provide a good base of listings that anyone\ncan buy. Who comes first? The sellers, or the buyers?\n\nThe proposal will also lead to a few Particl Marketplace improvements, such as\nadding a “wanted item” feature, the ability to edit/delete listings once\npublished on the marketplace, and potentially more. These features are not\nnecessarily intended for the mainnet Particl V3 release, but may very well be\npart of the next update after that (Particl Desktop 3.1).\n\nIt is expected that this proposal will move to the Funding Required phase in a\nmatter of days, so if you plan on supporting this initiative, keep your eyes\nopen for an update about it here on Particl.News or directly on CCS System.\n\nTo learn every detail about this proposal and see the community’s questions (and\ntheir corresponding answers), follow this link\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/3].\n\nMarketplace Listing Seeding Proposal by cryptoguard · Pull Request #3 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryFund the development, maintenance, and management\nof\nan automated system to seed Particl Marketplace with thousands of products (and\ntheir reviews) and various storefronts. The initiative a...particlGitHub\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/3]PART Unavailable on Flare\nWallet\nFlare Wallet has recently updated its back-end to use a different block explorer\n(BlockBook) other than Insight. However, due to a few concerns related to this\nback-end switch, the Particl team is currently evaluating whether it wants to\npursue a Flare Wallet listing or not.\n\nFor the moment, we recommend all Particl users to withdraw their PART coins from\nthe wallet while we evaluate the situation. We also recommend deactivating cold\nstaking completely for PART on Flare Wallet if it is already activated.\n\nThe Particl team is in touch with the Flare Wallet team and looking at the\nsituation. We will communicate more information about this at a later time.\n\n> Note: While it’s not possible to withdraw PART on the latest Flare Wallet\nversion, you can download previous builds (i.e., the desktop version of Flare\nWallet) on their website [https://flarewallet.io/] and then proceed with your\nwithdrawal.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat to Expect From Particl Going Into 2021\nParticl V3 is not the end of anything, but rather, the beginning of an exciting\nphase for Particl. Although the Year 2020 has been heavily focused on\ndevelopment and less so on adoption, the Year 2021 will reverse that trend.\n\nWith Particl V3 going live on mainnet, that’ll provide a much more user-friendly\nand powerful decentralized commerce experience to users all across the world and\nwill make user adoption for Particl much easier.\n\nTo that end, the Particl team has been working on, researching, and\nexperimenting with a few concepts, features, and additions to the Particl\necosystem. These aim at fixing some of the issues that Particl still faces when\nit comes to adoption. Here are some additional areas of improvement the Particl\nteam will be focusing energy on in 2021.\n\n * Improve the accessibility of the PART coin and ease the process of buying and\n   selling it.\n * Improve the community marketplace moderation model to be more efficient,\n   scalable, and require less manual input from Particl users.\n * Increase the number of listed items on the Particl Marketplace and increase\n   the on-chain activity (CCS proposal already published).\n * Improve the RingCT anonymity set.\n * Improve the overall scalability of the Particl Marketplace and its underlying\n   protocols to support significantly higher levels of adoption.\n * Reduce the impact of the price volatility of funds while they are being held\n   in escrow.\n\nThese are “some” of the challenges the Particl team will address moving forward\ninto 2021. Although a few of these challenges are already being looked at, the\nfirst step is, of course, to release Particl V3 on mainnet and then assess the\nsituation. How it goes will help determine priorities for 2021 and the post-V3\nphase for the project.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe are very excited to finally draw closer to the mainnet release of Particl V3\nand can’t wait to keep on expanding the Particl ecosystem and improving its\nadoption moving forward into 2021.\n\nDon’t forget to test out Particl V3-testnet all you can and report any bug or\nissue on Github and the Particl Community forum so that it can promptly be fixed\nbefore the “big release”. \n\nThe entire Particl team would like to thank you for your support and wishes you\na very merry Christmas and happy holidays!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

They have helped a lot testing the new V3 builds and identifying bugs and issues.</p><p>As a result, a few minor issues have been picked up, reported, and fixed. None of these issues were breaking bugs but rather improvements or quick to fix bugs. The team has been busy preparing the release and making sure that it’s first public testnet release would be as smooth as possible.</p><h3 id=\"testing-guidelines\"><a href=\"#Testing Guidelines\">Testing Guidelines</a></h3><p>With Particl V3-testnet live and going, now’s the time to test it out as much as possible. The goal here is to try to break it or make it behave unexpectedly. In fact, this testing phase is all about finding any edge case that may lead to problems once deployed on mainnet.</p><p>To properly report issues when testing Particl V3-testnet, click the <strong>bug icon</strong> at the bottom left corner of Particl Desktop and create a Github issue describing, in detail, the problem you’ve encountered.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/12/24-December-2020-09-11-00.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Additionally, you can join the <a href=\"https://particl.community/category/16/marketplace-testing\">Particl Community forum’s Marketplace Testing category</a> to discuss issues, ask questions, and find other Particl community members to test the marketplace and make test orders.</p><h2 id=\"work-on-atomic-swap-continues\">Work on Atomic Swap Continues</h2><p>Particl cryptographer Tecnovert has continued his work on atomic swaps so that they can be integrated into Particl Desktop. This will go a long way in improving PART's accessibility for all, including in the USA, and make the Particl platform more resilient to outside influence.</p><p>Of course, atomic swaps between Particl and coins like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero, Decred, and others are already possible, but they're generally unintuitive. That’s because atomic swaps need, at least for the moment, to be manually executed. That means two swappers need to manually find each other, agree to what currencies they want to exchange, at what rate, and at what time. During the swap, they also need to manually exchange multiple “swap files” either through email, instant messaging, or other means of communication. In other words, the process of completing an atomic swap is currently tedious and full of friction.</p><p>To fix those issues, Tecnovert has been working on a solution to fully automate all the steps and requirements to make an atomic swap. This solution, which can in many ways be likened to a DEX (decentralized exchange), is intended to be integrated into Particl Desktop once it’s ready for deployment.</p><p>That’ll allow anyone, anywhere in the world, to easily buy and sell PART without having to quit the Particl Desktop client. This integration won’t require any third-party, no account, no KYC, and won’t impose any limitation on the number of coins allowed to be traded.<br><br><strong>There is currently no ETA on this item</strong>. It’s a pretty complex and bleeding-edge challenge filled with unexpected setbacks and bumps. There is, after all, a reason why there are very few DEXes that are 100% decentralized. This is going to be a significant area of focus for Tecnovert going into 2021. More details will be shared as we progress further.</p><h2 id=\"particl-news-is-now-on-a-jamstack\">Particl.News is now on a Jamstack</h2><p>It’s finally done, Particl.News is now officially hosted on GitHub Pages. The editor’s interface is delivered by <strong>Ghost</strong> (the blog ??), and everything is glued together by <strong>Gatsby</strong>! This new way of hosting the blog provides the project with much more autonomy, a more tailored experience for the audience, easy to find translations, complete control over the website, and zero unnecessary noise or third-party branding for you.</p><p>If you’re reading this blog post, then you’re already on the \"Jamstack\"!</p><h2 id=\"the-particl-academy-is-about-to-go-live\">The Particl Academy is About to Go Live</h2><p>The internal testnet builds the team has had for the past few weeks have allowed a lot of work to be put into the Particl Academy. It’s been completely updated with all the recent information, tutorials, guides, and in-depth articles required to support the Particl V3 release.<br><br>You can expect the Particl Academy to drop somewhere during the current testing phase of Particl V3-testnet and before the mainnet release.</p><h2 id=\"new-ccs-proposal-to-support-the-v3-mainnet-release\">New CCS Proposal to Support the V3 Mainnet Release</h2><p>On the 3rd of December, a new key proposal has been suggested on the CCS system. This proposal aims at seeding the Particl Marketplace with thousands of listings to support the mainnet release of Particl V3.</p><p>This initiative aims to address the chicken and egg problem that each marketplace faces when launching and provide a good base of listings that anyone can buy. Who comes first? The sellers, or the buyers?<br><br>The proposal will also lead to a few Particl Marketplace improvements, such as adding a “wanted item” feature, the ability to edit/delete listings once published on the marketplace, and potentially more. These features are not necessarily intended for the mainnet Particl V3 release, but may very well be part of the next update after that (Particl Desktop 3.1).</p><p>It is expected that this proposal will move to the Funding Required phase in a matter of days, so if you plan on supporting this initiative, keep your eyes open for an update about it here on Particl.News or directly on CCS System.</p><p>To learn every detail about this proposal and see the community’s questions (and their corresponding answers), follow <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/3\">this link</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/3\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Marketplace Listing Seeding Proposal by cryptoguard · Pull Request #3 · particl/ccs-proposals</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">SummaryFund the development, maintenance, and management of an automated system to seed Particl Marketplace with thousands of products (and their reviews) and various storefronts.

[http://ccs.particl.io] \nhas been live, and there’s been a bit of action with it in the past few days.\nFor this reason, we’ve prepared a small update for the community.\n\nAs a reminder, the Community Crowdfunding System (CCS) is Particl’s brand new\nsystem for the community to push proposals to collect donations from the\ncommunity or pass ideas to a provably fair vote. Proposals can be any community\nproject, initiative, service, or desired feature that may require funding or a\nvote to be initiated.\n\nTo learn about the CCS in more detail, follow this link\n[https://particl.news/new-community-crowdfunding-system-f31f54231982].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe CCS Sees its First Proposal\nRoughly three weeks ago, Particl’s CCS saw its first proposal ever being\npublished by a community member. Please join with the Particl team to\ncongratulate and thank community member Ozandalgali for breaking the ice and\nbeing the first in Particl history to push a proposal on the CCS!\n\nAlthough relatively small in scope, the proposal requests a modest amount of\nPART for the funding of the creation of an explainer GIF to quickly illustrate\nthe concept of Particl’s novel two-party escrow system. Because Particl’s escrow\nsystem is quite different from what most people are used to when shopping or\nselling online (it uses the MAD game-theory instead of a third-party holding\nfunds on behalf of both users), this GIF will be quite helpful to help newcomers\nin understanding how it works.\n\nThis proposal inaugurated the CCS system and has now been pushed to the “Funding\nRequired” phase just a few moments ago. This means that anyone can now donate to\nthe initiative and get it moving. Particl’s Lead Brand Designer and UI/UX Lead\nGerlof van Ek (Crz) has already pledged to create the GIF.\n\nOnce again, thank you, Ozandalgali, for breaking the ice and anchoring yourself\nin Particl’s history!\n\n> To learn more about the proposal, click here\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/mad-escrow-GIF.html].\nA Second CCS Proposal Followed Suite\nJust a few days ago, a second proposal was pushed to the CCS proposal. This\ntime, it was pushed by two Particl team members — Juha Kovanen (Ludx) and\nCryptoguard. This proposal is relatively more extensive in scope than the first\none, and it aims at supporting the release of the groundbreaking and\nlong-anticipated Particl V3 release.\n\nThe proposal suggests funding for developing, deploying, and maintaining an\nautomated system that will list thousands of items on Particl V3, shipped from\nvarious locations. The system will also automatically process orders on Particl,\nreducing the time to move the escrow steps to the bare minimum technically\npossible for the network. This will tremendously reduce the gap (in terms of\nshopping experience) between traditional marketplaces and Particl’s\ndecentralized approach.\n\nThis proposal goes hand in hand with future outreach and user acquisition\nefforts. It is currently in the “idea phase” of the CCS, which means that it is\nstill up for discussion, comments, feedback, and amendment proposals. If you\nwant to partake in the discussion, head over to the proposal’s page and leave a\nreply at the bottom.\n\n> To learn more about the proposal, click here\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/3].\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDecentralizing Particl Even More\nA few weeks ago, it was mentioned in the November Project Update\n[https://particl.news/project-update-26-11-2020-2bdaedb3e96b] that the Particl\nteam has decided to hold off from collecting a salary for their work\nmomentarily. As an alternative, it is likely that a few proposals here and there\nmay be pushed, independently by team members, to the CCS from time to time.\n\nThis new approach increases the project’s community aspect and gives all of its\nmembers much more decisional power. Indeed, the community can now approve or\ndisapprove current and future proposals by either donating or not and letting\ntheir voice be heard. It also gives the community all the tools they need to\ngather support from other members for any idea or project they may have that\ndirectly benefits Particl. No more does everything have to go through the team, \nanyone can now steer this ship that is the Particl project!\n\nYou can now expect a few proposals, sponsored by team members or managed by\nthem, to go live on the CCS. Some of them may involve some team members working\non initiatives, while others may involve third-party contractors or partners\nwith whom the team has developed relationships. There are a few initiatives in\nthe pipeline that should be soon published, and the team is looking forward to\npresenting them to you!\n\nOn-Chain Voting is Coming to the CCS\nThe Particl team has been working on a new on-chain voting system and will be\nintegrating it into the CCS shortly. This will give the system more flexibility\nand allow anyone to push proposals that may require a community vote to move\nforward. This can be, for example, a proposal that suggests a modification to\nParticl Core or another critical aspect of the ecosystem.\n\nThe ability to push proposals that require voting may also be used by anyone in\nthe community to spend, move, or manage the Community Fund’s funds.

Made Easy\nEver since the release of Particl Desktop 2.0 and the Particl Marketplace on\nmainnet, it has been possible for any Particl user to create and push proposals\nto the network and get them voted by the community. That’s all thanks to the\nin-app Community Proposal system that uses SMSG, the same network used to\ndisplay listings and carry orders on the marketplace, and off-chain voting.\n\nHowever, this proposal system has fallen short of becoming a true and solid tool\nfor community governance for a few reasons. First off, it didn’t create any\npermanent voting record that could be used to prove the outcome, in retrospect,\nof any proposal. Additionally, it didn’t give the ability for people to raise\nfunds for community-led initiatives and projects. Finally, the in-app Community\nProposal system is currently only available in “market-enabled” wallets, meaning\nwallets that have the Particl Marketplace enabled. This has prevented everyone\nwithout funds on a market-enabled wallet to participate in any sort of\ngovernance.\n\nThese issues have led the community to instead push proposals, especially\nproposals that require funding, onto other platforms such as the Particl\ncommunity forum. While this gave more flexibility to proposers, this has also\ncreated its load of disadvantages such as spreading proposals all over into\ndifferent platforms.\n\nFor this reason, the Particl team has just released the CCS framework\n[https://ccs.particl.io/] which is now available on Particl’s official website.\n\n * https://ccs.particl.io/\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s the CCS Framework\nThe CCS proposal is a community crowdfunding and governance system to which a\nbrand new on-chain voting mechanism will be added at a later time. The framework\nis based on Monero’s and Zcoin’s own CCS framework (dubbed ZCS for Zcoin), which\nis open-source and available for all to use and fork on Github, and has been\ntweaked by Particl developers.\n\nThe CCS framework allows anyone to propose initiatives, projects and, later on,\nprotocol changes that benefit the Particl ecosystem and community. It increases\nthe decentralization of both the governance of the project and its funding,\nsomething the team has been wanting to do for a long time.\n\nThis new system uses Github and a user-friendly interface to make it as easy and\neffortless for anyone to let their voice be heard by the rest of the community.\n\n * Learn more about the CCS framework and its rules\n   [http://ccs.particl.io/what-is-ccs/]\n * Learn how to push your own proposal [http://ccs.particl.io/how-to-ccs/]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe CCS Framework and its Many Benefits\nThe CCS framework allows anyone to push their own proposals to the network and\nget the community talking about it. Here are some of the main benefits it\nintroduces.\n\nMore Decentralization\nThe CCS further decentralizes the Particl ecosystem by giving more power than\never to its community. Anyone can now propose ideas, projects, or initiatives\nand get them independently funded.\n\nDo you have an idea, feature, or initiative that you want to see come alive?\nThen now you can take the lead and make it happen! You have full freedom over\nwhat you can do, even including hiring an independent developer or development\nfirm to complete the task at hand and get the bill funded by the community!\n\nMore Transparency and Accountability\nAs the CCS framework uses Github as its back-end and to host discussions, all\ncomments, feedback, and counter-proposals are permanently logged for all to see.\nThe same goes for any modification or edit to proposals, there is no possibility\nto stealth edit proposals to fool or mislead anyone. The CCS framework is as\ntransparent as it can be and forces proposers into full accountability to the\nParticl community.\n\nA Central Place to Find Proposals\nYou don’t need to be looking at multiple places at once now, the CCS framework\nis now the default place for all proposals to be logged and presented to the\ncommunity. This will make it easier for anyone to see what are the currently\nactive initiatives, proposals, and community votes (coming at a later point in\ntime).\n\nUser-Friendly Interface\nForget about the clunky process of dealing with proposals on a forum, a Discord\nchannel, or straight on Github. Yes, the CCS framework uses Github as its\nbackend, but it’s supported by a user-friendly and easy-to-use user interface\nthat anyone can understand.\n\nFunds Escrowed by the Particl Team\nDon’t worry about scammers or impersonators. All funds sent by the community to\nsupport any initiative are escrowed by the Particl team and only released upon\ncompletion of the task.\n\nPerhaps a proposal is rather complex or requires funds to be disbursed upfront?\nThen you can set up milestones so that the Particl team only disburses funds\nupon their completion. An upfront payment, in that case, would have to be the\nfirst milestone of a proposal. That should provide the community with confidence\nwhen sending funds to “strangers with an idea”.\n\n(Future Feature) On-Chain Voting for Protocol Changes\nSince Particl’s inception in July of 2017, the community has come up with a slew\nof proposals and ideas that would affect the Particl protocol. These can include\nstaking interest rates, the default number of RingCT mixins, and so on.\n\nTake note that, since protocol changes are pretty major modifications to the\necosystem, these will require a strong consensus within the community as well as\na general approval from relevant Particl team members. This is to ensure the\nsecurity of the network, the feasibility of proposed protocol changes, and to\nkeep in mind all potential drawbacks resulting from a specific change.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Next\nNext on the CCS roadmap is, as probably evident by now, the new on-chain voting\nsystem which will allow the community to provably reach consensus whenever it\nneeds to be reached.\n\nThe new voting system will have many benefits over the current off-chain and\nin-app voting system of Particl Desktop (Community Proposals section in\nmarket-enabled wallets), all of which will be explained in detail in a future\nblog post.\n\nAs it stands right now, the new on-chain voting system still requires a few\ntweaks before it can be integrated into the CCS framework, but that should be\ndealt with rather quickly.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet’s Take Particl to the Next Level Together\nNow’s the time to get active and creative. The new CCS framework finally makes\navailable the tools necessary for the community to take the lead on various\ninitiatives and improve the ecosystem in an infinite number of ways.\n\nThe Particl team is committed to escrow the donated funds, support efforts by\nthe community, and encourage the growth of the network in a more independent way\nfor the foreseeable future. The team is very excited to see what the community\nwill come up with and happy to be able to increase the decentralization of the\nnetwork to higher levels.\n\nLet’s grow the Particl ecosystem all together and dramatically expand its\npotential.","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/New-Community-Crowdfunding-System/1-qyHIakjDEm-0DenBPOBelQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"proposing-and-supporting-community-initiatives-made-easy\">Proposing and Supporting Community Initiatives Made Easy</h3><p>Ever since the release of Particl Desktop 2.0 and the Particl Marketplace on mainnet, it has been possible for any Particl user to create and push proposals to the network and get them voted by the community.

Here are some of the main benefits it introduces.</p><h3 id=\"more-decentralization\">More Decentralization</h3><p>The CCS further decentralizes the Particl ecosystem by giving more power than ever to its community. Anyone can now propose ideas, projects, or initiatives and get them independently funded.</p><p>Do you have an idea, feature, or initiative that you want to see come alive? Then now you can take the lead and make it happen! You have full freedom over what you can do, even including hiring an independent developer or development firm to complete the task at hand and get the bill funded by the community!</p><h3 id=\"more-transparency-and-accountability\">More Transparency and Accountability</h3><p>As the CCS framework uses Github as its back-end and to host discussions, all comments, feedback, and counter-proposals are permanently logged for all to see. The same goes for any modification or edit to proposals, there is no possibility to stealth edit proposals to fool or mislead anyone. The CCS framework is as transparent as it can be and forces proposers into full accountability to the Particl community.</p><h3 id=\"a-central-place-to-find-proposals\">A Central Place to Find Proposals</h3><p>You don’t need to be looking at multiple places at once now, the CCS framework is now the default place for all proposals to be logged and presented to the community. This will make it easier for anyone to see what are the currently active initiatives, proposals, and community votes (coming at a later point in time).</p><h3 id=\"user-friendly-interface\">User-Friendly Interface</h3><p>Forget about the clunky process of dealing with proposals on a forum, a Discord channel, or straight on Github. Yes, the CCS framework uses Github as its backend, but it’s supported by a user-friendly and easy-to-use user interface that anyone can understand.</p><h3 id=\"funds-escrowed-by-the-particl-team\">Funds Escrowed by the Particl Team</h3><p>Don’t worry about scammers or impersonators. All funds sent by the community to support any initiative are escrowed by the Particl team and only released upon completion of the task.</p><p>Perhaps a proposal is rather complex or requires funds to be disbursed upfront? Then you can set up milestones so that the Particl team only disburses funds upon their completion. An upfront payment, in that case, would have to be the first milestone of a proposal. That should provide the community with confidence when sending funds to “strangers with an idea”.</p><h3 id=\"-future-feature-on-chain-voting-for-protocol-changes\">(Future Feature) On-Chain Voting for Protocol Changes</h3><p>Since Particl’s inception in July of 2017, the community has come up with a slew of proposals and ideas that would affect the Particl protocol. These can include staking interest rates, the default number of RingCT mixins, and so on.</p><p>Take note that, since protocol changes are pretty major modifications to the ecosystem, these will require a strong consensus within the community as well as a general approval from relevant Particl team members. This is to ensure the security of the network, the feasibility of proposed protocol changes, and to keep in mind all potential drawbacks resulting from a specific change.</p><hr><h2 id=\"what-s-next\"><strong>What’s Next</strong></h2><p>Next on the CCS roadmap is, as probably evident by now, the new on-chain voting system which will allow the community to provably reach consensus whenever it needs to be reached.</p><p>The new voting system will have many benefits over the current off-chain and in-app voting system of Particl Desktop (Community Proposals section in market-enabled wallets), all of which will be explained in detail in a future blog post.</p><p>As it stands right now, the new on-chain voting system still requires a few tweaks before it can be integrated into the CCS framework, but that should be dealt with rather quickly.</p><hr><h2 id=\"let-s-take-particl-to-the-next-level-together\">Let’s Take Particl to the Next Level Together</h2><p>Now’s the time to get active and creative. The new CCS framework finally makes available the tools necessary for the community to take the lead on various initiatives and improve the ecosystem in an infinite number of ways.</p><p>The Particl team is committed to escrow the donated funds, support efforts by the community, and encourage the growth of the network in a more independent way for the foreseeable future. The team is very excited to see what the community will come up with and happy to be able to increase the decentralization of the network to higher levels.</p><p>Let’s grow the Particl ecosystem all together and dramatically expand its potential.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/New-Community-Crowdfunding-System/1-XCch9txNp7tj0olm4-M3yQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":["kg-card","kg-image-card","kg-width-wide"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"/glink/downloaded_images/New-Community-Crowdfunding-System/1-qyHIakjDEm-0DenBPOBelQ.jpeg","className":["kg-image"],"alt":""},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{"id":"proposing-and-supporting-community-initiatives-made-easy"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Proposing and Supporting Community Initiatives Made Easy"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Ever since the release of Particl Desktop 2.0 and the Particl Marketplace on mainnet, it has been possible for any Particl user to create and push proposals to the network and get them voted by the community.

The xmrswap protocol\nis based on the work of Joël Gugger (h4sh3d [https://github.com/h4sh3d]) from\nthe Monero community.

It is only available\nin CLI (command-line interface) for the moment.Although the protocol is safe and\nhas been tested extensively, it should still be considered as experimental\nsoftware. Its usage is reserved for advanced users only and no immediate support\nwill be provided from the Particl team or Tecnovert.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s an Atomic Swap\nIf you’re unfamiliar with the term, an “atomic swap” is a special type of \ncross-chain exchange that allows two parties that don’t know each other to\nexchange a currency for another without involving a third-party like an exchange\nor escrow service provider. The process is entirely trustless, meaning that you\ndon’t need to trust the other party to know for certain you won’t get scammed.\nThe integrity of each swap is guaranteed by cryptography.\n\nIn the specific case of this blog post, the “atomic swap” refers to the process\nof safely exchanging Monero for Particl, or Particl for Monero, without the help\nof any third-party.\n\nMonero and Particl Atomic Swap Use Cases\nAlthough this Proof-of-Concept is still only available as a command-line tool\nand reserved for advanced users only, it sets the foundation for future and\ndeeper integrations into the Particl ecosystem. Here are just some of the\nuse-cases the xmrswap protocol enables.\n\nShop online using XMR\nMonero is the world’s most private cryptocurrency. Particl has the world’s most\nprivate marketplace. Both are unstoppable. Then why not combine them and get the\nworld’s most private, unstoppable eCommerce ecosystem?\n\nThe xmrswap protocol can be integrated in such a way that lets you easily swap\nXMR for PART to privately buy anything on the Particl Marketplace without\nleaving any digital footprint. This same integration can be applied to easily\ncash out marketplace sales revenue into Monero and get that extra privacy layer\nwhen leaving the Particl ecosystem.\n\nIncreases Particl’s resiliency\nAdding a more user-friendly interface that easily allows to swap Monero, and\nother cryptocurrencies, for Particl will also increase Particl’s resiliency and\nmake it unstoppable.\n\nThat’s because atomic swaps, other than simply being great tools for privacy,\nsecurity, decentralization, and freedom, also act as a solid fallback solution\nin case of exchange delisting, geographical bans, and other types of restrictive\nmeasures. It reduces the overall influence some third-parties may have over the\nnetwork and allows it to be accessible in perpetuity.\n\nPrivately acquire PART\nA deeper integration into Particl Desktop would allow you to privately acquire\nPART straight from the Particl wallet and without having to forfeit your data to\nanyone, including exchanges, ISPs, and etc.\n\nThis is a particularly strong use-case if you take your privacy seriously as it\nnot only protects your personal information when using the marketplace, but also\nbefore and after using it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Next?\nIntegration of the xmrswapprotocol into Particl Desktop is an entirely separate\ntask and requires other Particl developers other than just Tecnovert to get\ninvolved. As they are currently busy with the Particl V3 release as well as\nother tasks, it is currently not possible to estimate when it will be ready.\n\nThere is, however, some mock ups in the works of how an xmrswap integration may\nlook like in Particl Desktop. Here’s one!\n\nTake note that this mock up is purely a work-in-progress and would most\ndefinitely look a bit different when it’ll be ready for release. It does,\nhowever, gives a good visual representation of how it may look like.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis news announcement is only part of some more major announcements coming\nsoon.

This module, which is available right inside\nthe Particl Desktop application, lets you easily swap other cryptocurrencies for\nPART so that you can anonymously buy or sell anything on the marketplace. This\ncan be done, without ever leaving the Particl Desktop client, by using the\nstandalone swap module which is currently being powered by partners such as \nStealthEX [https://stealthex.io] and SimpleSwap [https://simpleswap.io/].\n\nImprovements Through Better Bot Management Support\nTo explain more precisely what improvements Particl V3 will bring to the swap\nengine, Particl developer Arnold Bansemer takes the time to elaborate on the\ntopic.\n\n“The biggest part of the in-app swap engine changes is better bot management.\nBots will increasingly drive traffic onto the network and will end up playing a\nnon-trivial role in getting some external functionality into the Particl\necosystem.\n\nWhat we’re aiming to do with the ongoing changes being made to the swap engine\nis to create a set of defined functionalities and requirements for how bot info\nis received and processed which will push towards a standardized way of creating\n“legitimate” bots.\n\nUsing these requirements, the bot manager in PD will then effectively act as a\n“processing plant” for bots. The bot manager UI in the desktop will provide the\nuser with a way to manage different bots (add/remove/view details/etc). Other\napps (i.e. the marketplace) wanting to use a bot of a certain type, or provide\nbot management for a particular bot type, will interact directly with the bot\nmanager to obtain those details.”\n\nMore Robust Framework\nParticl developer Arnold Bansemer continues: “The bot manager will help ensure\nthat only those bots meeting a particular standard set of functionality are\navailable. For example, in the case of Particl’s swap module, it would only\ninquire about EXCHANGE type of bots and display the relevant information based\non context.\n\nWhen receiving a message on the bot listener address, the bot manager probes the\nbot to find out its commands, and argument types, etc. Once this is known\n(assuming we get valid data back), Particl apps (i.e. the marketplace) can start\ndoing all sorts of things like show upgrade changes, allow apps to use specific\nversions of bots, receive specific requests or data, and etc.”\n\nList of Swap Engine Improvements\nIn addition to the back-end changes being made to the bot manager, a few\nadditional improvements and goodies are being added to the swap engine itself.\n\nThe main improvements it’s receiving with the V3 release are as follow:\n\n * More coins being made available to swap\n * Completely new user interface\n * More dynamic and responsive process\n * More built-in security measures\n * Aggregated display of available offers\n\nThe sum of all these changes makes Particl’s in-app swap engine as smooth to use\nas ever. A special mention is worth giving to whoever pushed a prediction market\nSMSG bot onto the network a few weeks ago, prompting the Particl team to develop\na more robust and efficient framework for community bot management and\ndeployment.\n\nNew Coins Getting Listed on V3 Release\nParticl’s in-app swap engine (WIP and subject to change before release)To\nsupport the mainnet launch of Particl V3 along with its improved in-app swap\nengine, new coins will be added and ready to swap on the day of the release.\n\n * Monero [https://www.getmonero.org/] (XMR)\n * DAI [https://makerdao.com/en/] (MakerDAO’s stablecoin)\n * NIX [https://nixplatform.io/] (Flare Wallet)\n * USDt [https://tether.to/] (Tether stablecoin)\n * USDC [https://www.centre.io/usdc] (Circle & Coinbase stablecoin)\n\nThese coins not only make Particl as accessible as before by extending the\nnumber of cryptocurrencies that can be used on the platform, but they also\nprovide new valuable functionalities by either adding an additional privacy\nlayer (i.e. Monero) to the mix or by allowing stablecoin payments to be made\n(i.e. DAI).\n\nKeep an Eye Out for More Coins to Come\nThis is only a beginning. Following the Particl V3 mainnet release, new coins\nwill start getting added more regularly to the improved in-app swap module. This\nwill create a cascading effect of added utility, network effect, as well as\nincrease the pool of potential marketplace shoppers and sellers.\n\nThis will create a perfect storm scenario — the combination of (1) all the new\ncoins getting added to Particl, (2) the improved in-app swapping experience, and\n(3) the major impact on the overall user experience caused by the V3 release\nwill make it as easy as ever to get new people to try on Particl.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIs there any coin you’d like to see added on Particl?

This staking node can be hosted on any device, whether at home, on a VPS (cloud servers), or on any internet-connected device. Its only purpose is to stake on the network on behalf of other wallets.</p><p>Cold staking significantly improves the security of your funds when staking. Since you’re putting in charge an external node to do the staking, you can store your coins on any sort of device, online or off-line. That can be a cold wallet, a hardware device (i.e. Ledger or Trezor), a mobile wallet (Particl Copay or Flare Wallet), a multi-signature address, and etc.</p><p>If your staking node ever gets breached into or hacked, the attacker wouldn’t be able to steal any coin as the node itself contains no coin at all. All it’s doing is staking on the network using the weight of coins stored securely somewhere else.</p><p>To learn how to set up your own cold staking node, check out this tutorial: <a href=\"https://particl.news/guide-setting-up-particl-cold-staking-f5d9073bac4\"><strong>https://particl.news/guide-setting-up-particl-cold-staking-f5d9073bac4</strong></a></p><p><a href=\"https://particl.news/guide-setting-up-particl-cold-staking-f5d9073bac4\"><strong>Guide: Setting up Particl Cold Staking</strong></a><br><a href=\"https://particl.news/guide-setting-up-particl-cold-staking-f5d9073bac4\"><em>A Node, a Wallet and a Smart Contract</em>particl.news</a></p><h3 id=\"available-on-the-mobile-wallet\">Available on the Mobile Wallet</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Flare-Wallet-and-Particl-Partnership/1-l3np0Obe-MExR5hj9WjXzQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>In just a matter of days, Flare Wallet will be pushing a new update to its mobile wallet which will enable cold staking for Particl.</p><p>Don’t worry about the mobile data cost of staking.

This includes shirts, caps,\nhoodies, and some very special mugs.\n\nFor the occasion, there are some pretty sweet but time-limited deals going on!\nFirst come, first serve, so make sure to hurry up!\n\n * First 20 shirts are 1 PART, the next 80 shirts will only be $5\n * First 10 hoodies are 1 PART, the next 20 hoodies will only be $5\n * First 20 mugs are 1 PART, the next 40 mugs will only be $5\n\n> Get them while the deal lasts!\nA Perfect Match for Privacy Nuts\nThe most interesting aspect of topping up your Particl account using Zcoin is\nthe compounding effect gained from combining different privacy protocols\ntogether. Whether you’re primarily a Zcoin or a Particl user, you can\nsignificantly raise your level of privacy and security when shopping online with \nthis simple trick\n[https://particl.news/zcoin-gets-listed-on-particl-7dfcf0bf69d4#8c4c].\n\nDifferent Approaches to Privacy\nZcoin and Particl adopt fundamentally different approaches to privacy and\nanonymize cryptocurrency transactions in different ways.\n\nZcoin uses what is known as SIGMA\n[https://zcoin.io/direct-untraceable-anonymous-lelantus/] and will soon move to\nits evolved version —Lelantus\n[https://zcoin.io/direct-untraceable-anonymous-lelantus/]. It is a\nzero-knowledge protocol that basically burns coins and redeems them at some\nlater point without any trail of how it got there being visible. It also allows\ndirect anonymous payments by giving the “right to redeem coins” to someone else.\nThis privacy protocol completely breaks the traceability of transactions.\n\nParticl, on the other hand, doesn’t destroy and redeem coins. It instead uses \nRingCT [https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd] \nto mix coins with others and uses “decoys” to obfuscate the payment trail even\nmore. Because RingCT transactions are mandatory for all marketplace\ntransactions, it protects users not only with strong cryptographic privacy but\nalso credible plausible deniability\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption].\n\nBoth of these approaches (burning/redeeming vs mixing) have their pros and cons.\nFor example, Zcoin may break the traceability of transactions more definitively\nbut Particl allows for a lot of flexibility which is a must since its\nmarketplace relies on privacy-oriented smart-contracts. As always with this kind\nof technology, there is never a clear winner and neither should there be. So why\nnot mix both protocols and get the best of both worlds?\n\nBetter Together\nWith just a few extra steps, you can combine the benefits of both privacy\nprotocols and get a much better level of online privacy when shopping online.\n\nAll you need to do is to first make a private transaction on the Zcoin network,\nredeem your coins, and use them to top up your Particl account with Particl\nDesktop’s in-app swap engine. This same process can also be done when checking\nout your cart on the Particl Marketplace.\n\nSimply follow these steps:\n\n * On Zcoin, execute a private XZC transaction.\n * Redeem the coins into a public address (ideally in a fresh wallet for added\n   privacy)\n * Open up Particl Desktop and initiate an XZC to PART swap\n * Send the PART you’ve received from the swap to an anon balance\n * Shop online in total privacy (SIGMA + RingCT)\n\nFollowing this simple trick will significantly improve your privacy when\nshopping online. Tracing back the payment back to you would not only require the\nParticl network to be deanonymized but the Zcoin network as well.\n\nSince both protocols are so fundamentally different, RingCT and SIGMA zero-day\nexploits are less likely to affect both protocols at the same time. If one\nprotocol ever fails, you know the other’s protecting you as a backup!\n\n> Note: Protecting your transaction information when shopping online is just one\nstep of the giant puzzle. Particl also natively protects your online identity,\nsecure your communications, doesn’t collect or even generate any metadata about\nyou, and lets you hide your network identity (IP address).

It is the first to develop and implement the Sigma Protocol, which\nallows users to have complete privacy over their transactions via zero-knowledge\ncryptographic proofs without the need for trusted setup. Its research labs also\ncreated the Lelantus privacy protocol which has gained academic acclaim and set\nto go live on Zcoin in 2020.\n\nIn 2018, Zcoin made history by having the Thai Democrat Party’s elections held\non its blockchain with over 127,000 votes cast nationwide.\n\nAbout Particl\nParticl is a privacy-first and worldwide censorship-resistant eCommerce platform\nbuilt on blockchain and peer-to-peer technology. It restores the balance of\npower towards the individual, not corporations or authorities, by decentralizing\ncore aspects of today’s internet and economy.\n\nThe Particl Marketplace is a decentralized and reliable multi-vendor marketplace\nthat lets anyone in the world buy and sell anything, without leaving a trace. It\neliminates the problems of trust, personal data abuse, and enrichment of large\ncorporations. It preserves privacy at any time and enables a trading scope for\nunbeatable product pricing. Free of any third-party interference, it creates a\nfair level playing field.\n\nThe Particl coin (PART) is the native currency of the Particl Marketplace. It is\na privacy coin that offers strong but flexible data protection and privacy\ncapabilities using a combination of the Confidential Transactions (CT) and\nRingCT (with Bulletproofs) privacy protocols. It is the first coin built on the\nBitcoin codebase to ever make these protocols available.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLearn More About Particl\n * What to expect in Particl V3.0\n   [https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\n * All about Particl’s fundamentals\n   [https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/ffbzfw/particl_chart_prior_to_its_massive_update/]\n * Complete collection of useful links\n   [https://www.reddit.com/r/Particl/comments/pxu0py/getting_started/]\n * Join the community on Telegram [https://t.me/ParticlOn]\n * Join the community on Discord [https://discord.me/particl]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Zcoin-is-Live-on-Particl/1-w3OMndBq3t132yt3_iMkDg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"the-world-s-most-private-way-to-shop-online\">The World’s Most Private Way to Shop Online</h3><p><strong>Zcoin</strong> has been added to Particl’s decentralized marketplace and desktop application as of this <strong>6th of July 2020 at 3:00 PM UTC</strong>.

Whether you’re primarily a Zcoin or a Particl user, you can significantly raise your level of privacy and security when shopping online with <a href=\"https://particl.news/zcoin-gets-listed-on-particl-7dfcf0bf69d4#8c4c\"><strong>this simple trick</strong></a>.</p><h2 id=\"different-approaches-to-privacy\">Different Approaches to Privacy</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Zcoin-is-Live-on-Particl/0-ol1PadCGMr0x-hDg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Zcoin and Particl adopt fundamentally different approaches to privacy and anonymize cryptocurrency transactions in different ways.</p><p>Zcoin uses what is known as <a href=\"https://zcoin.io/direct-untraceable-anonymous-lelantus/\"><strong>SIGMA</strong></a> and will soon move to its evolved version — <a href=\"https://zcoin.io/direct-untraceable-anonymous-lelantus/\"><strong>Lelantus</strong></a>.<strong> </strong>It is a zero-knowledge protocol that basically <strong>burns coins</strong> and <strong>redeems them</strong> at some later point without any trail of how it got there being visible. It also allows direct anonymous payments by giving the “right to redeem coins” to someone else. This privacy protocol completely breaks the traceability of transactions.</p><p>Particl, on the other hand, doesn’t destroy and redeem coins. It instead uses <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd\"><strong>RingCT</strong></a> to <strong>mix coins</strong> with others and uses “<strong>decoys</strong>” to obfuscate the payment trail even more. Because RingCT transactions are mandatory for all marketplace transactions, it protects users not only with strong cryptographic privacy but also credible <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption\">plausible deniability</a>.</p><p>Both of these approaches (burning/redeeming vs mixing) have their pros and cons. For example, Zcoin may break the traceability of transactions more definitively but Particl allows for a lot of flexibility which is a must since its marketplace relies on privacy-oriented smart-contracts. As always with this kind of technology, there is never a clear winner and neither should there be. So why not mix both protocols and get the best of both worlds?</p><h3 id=\"better-together\">Better Together</h3><p>With just a few extra steps, you can combine the benefits of both privacy protocols and get a much better level of online privacy when shopping online.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Zcoin-is-Live-on-Particl/0-qYgCKKNSqU9R8obf.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>All you need to do is to first make a private transaction on the Zcoin network, redeem your coins, and use them to top up your Particl account with Particl Desktop’s in-app swap engine. This same process can also be done when checking out your cart on the Particl Marketplace.</p><p><strong>Simply follow these steps:</strong></p><ul><li>On Zcoin, execute a private XZC transaction.</li><li>Redeem the coins into a public address (ideally in a fresh wallet for added privacy)</li><li>Open up Particl Desktop and initiate an XZC to PART swap</li><li>Send the PART you’ve received from the swap to an anon balance</li><li>Shop online in total privacy (SIGMA + RingCT)</li></ul><p>Following this simple trick will significantly improve your privacy when shopping online. Tracing back the payment back to you would not only require the Particl network to be deanonymized but the Zcoin network as well.</p><p>Since both protocols are so fundamentally different, RingCT and SIGMA zero-day exploits are less likely to affect both protocols at the same time. If one protocol ever fails, you know the other’s protecting you as a backup!</p><blockquote><em><strong>Note:</strong> Protecting your transaction information when shopping online is just one step of the giant puzzle.

Particl team is excited to announce that leading privacy coin Zcoin will be\nadded to Particl’s decentralized marketplace and desktop application on the 6th\nof July 2020 at 3:00 PM UTC. This will allow you to easily top up your Particl\naccount using Zcoin to privately buy anything on the Particl Marketplace. Zcoin\nis the first cryptocurrency, after Bitcoin, to be added to Particl as an\nalternative account funding option.\n\nAdding Zcoin to Particl provides the Zcoin community with a safe way to spend\ntheir Zcoin without any intermediary and without leaving any digital footprint\nbehind.

To learn\nhow Particl V3.0 is going to completely change the game, read this blog post\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813] \nabout it.\n\nStepping Things Up Again With Particl Desktop 3.0\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\nA New Breakthrough for Privacy and eCommerce ?particl.news\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\n\nTo discuss the release, Zcoin’s Project Steward Reuben Yap and Particl\nambassador Dr. Kap will get together for an onboarding talk that will be\npublished on Particl’s Youtube channel [https://youtube.com/particl] on the 6th\nof July at 3:00 PM UTC.\n\n> Note: All purchases made on the marketplace are ultimately settled in PART.\nThat’s because payments need to be secured by Particl’s two-party escrow\nsmart-contract.

Whether you’re primarily a Zcoin or a Particl user, you can\nsignificantly raise your level of privacy and security when shopping online with \nthis simple trick.\n\nParticl MarketplaceDifferent Approaches to Privacy\nZcoin and Particl adopt fundamentally different approaches to privacy and\nanonymize cryptocurrency transactions in different ways.\n\nZcoin uses what is known as SIGMA\n[https://zcoin.io/direct-untraceable-anonymous-lelantus/] and will soon move to\nits evolved version —Lelantus\n[https://zcoin.io/direct-untraceable-anonymous-lelantus/]. It is a\nzero-knowledge protocol that basically burns coins and redeems them at some\nlater point without any trail of how it got there being visible. It also allows\ndirect anonymous payments by giving the “right to redeem coins” to someone else.\nThis privacy protocol completely breaks the traceability of transactions.\n\nParticl, on the other hand, doesn’t destroy and redeem coins. It instead uses \nRingCT [https://particl.news/particl-explained-private-transactions-44cb120d9cd] \nto mix coins with others and uses “decoys” to obfuscate the payment trail even\nmore. Because RingCT transactions are mandatory for all marketplace\ntransactions, it protects users not only with strong cryptographic privacy but\nalso credible plausible deniability\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption].\n\nBoth of these approaches (burning/redeeming vs mixing) have their pros and cons.\nFor example, Zcoin may break the traceability of transactions more definitively\nbut Particl allows for a lot of flexibility which is a must since its\nmarketplace relies on privacy-oriented smart-contracts. As always with this kind\nof technology, there is never a clear winner and neither should there be. So why\nnot mix both protocols and get the best of both worlds?\n\nTogether’s Better\nWith just a few extra steps, you can combine the benefits of both privacy\nprotocols and get a much better level of online privacy when shopping online.\n\nAll you need to do is to first make a private transaction on the Zcoin network,\nredeem your coins, and use them to top up your Particl account with Particl\nDesktop’s in-app swap engine. This same process can also be done when checking\nout your cart on the Particl Marketplace.\n\nSimply follow these steps:\n\n * On Zcoin, execute a private XZC transaction.\n * Redeem the coins into a public address (ideally in a fresh wallet for added\n   privacy)\n * Open up Particl Desktop and initiate an XZC to PART swap\n * Send the PART you’ve received from the swap to an anon balance\n * Shop online in total privacy (SIGMA + RingCT)\n\nFollowing this simple trick will significantly improve your privacy when\nshopping online. Tracing back the payment back to you would not only require the\nParticl network to be deanonymized but the Zcoin network as well.\n\nSince both protocols are so fundamentally different, RingCT and SIGMA zero-day\nexploits are less likely to affect both protocols at the same time. If one\nprotocol ever fails, you know the other’s protecting you as a backup!\n\n> Note: Protecting your transaction information when shopping online is just one\nstep of the giant puzzle.

The Particl team is also opening up a \nvoluntary donation address for community members to support outreach\ninitiatives.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA Marketplace for Everyone\nCryptocurrency communities tend to be tribal by nature, but Particl has always\nstrived to be a project building solutions that everybody can benefit from. It’s\nin the project’s DNA. As such, Particl’s decentralized marketplace and desktop\nclient is designed to be able to accept a multitude of payment options, not just\nits native coin (PART).\n\nThe rationale for this inclusive approach is simple\n[https://particl.news/bitcoin-particl-building-an-independent-economy-together-b293e214a094]\n—privacy, security, reliability, and being able to buy and sell anything online \nwithout censorship, restrictions, interference, nor fees, should be made easily\navailable to everyone in the world and not be exclusive to one community only.\nThe technology exists and has been live for a while, what good would it do and\nwhat societal progress would it really trigger if it’s kept exclusive to a\nselect group of individuals?\n\nBitcoin Accepted Here\nWith this in mind, Particl added the ability to make Bitcoin payments\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0] as\npart of Particl’s marketplace checkout process and as a standalone swap engine\nin December 2019. This allowed anyone possessing Bitcoin to spend it anonymously\nand buy anything available on the marketplace using the world’s most popular\ncryptocurrency.

now been ten months since the first version of the Particl\nmarketplace — an open and decentralized marketplace — has been live on mainnet.\nSince August 2019, hundreds of sales have been made all around the world in full\nanonymity, without paying any fee, and without any intermediary. And it’s about\nto get much better with Particl’s coming massive upgrade!\n\nN95 Masks for Sale, Uncensored, on ParticlFrom masks and survival gears banned\non most online marketplaces during COVID-19 to video games, gift cards, physical\nBitcoin Casascius coins, hemp, or art, all kinds of goods are already being\nexchanged on Particl’s open marketplace. But imagine if you could now set up \nyour own marketplace or storefront and share it with who you want? What would\nyou sell?\n\nYou want to start a specialized freelancer marketplace? A public CBD shop? A\nprecious metal trading community? A private marketplace for Casascius and other\ncollectible coins? A place to trade NFTs without any risk of being scammed? A\nphysical crypto art marketplace to take out middleman fees? Or maybe you just\nwant to sell your Reddit account full of karma?\n\nThen you will love Particl’s next upgrade, Particl Desktop 3.0 (Multi-Markets),\nbecause it enables this, and much, much more than ever before.\n\nKeep reading for a detailed breakdown of everything Particl Desktop 3.0 will\nhave to offer!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDo you already know all about Particl? Then jump to straight to the Particl\nDesktop 3.0 Update section of this blog post.\n\nTable of Content\n * What’s the Particl Marketplace?\n * Its Evolution Since it Launched\n * A Completely New Marketplace and Desktop Application\n * Re-Writing Particl Desktop\n * Adding More Features Than Initially Planned\n * What’s New With Particl Desktop 3.0\n * Particl Desktop\n * Marketplace Improvements\n * More to Come After the V3 Release\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s the Particl Marketplace?\nParticl is an autonomous and decentralized marketplace protocol that allows\npeople to safely and privately buy and sell anything online without requiring\nany third-party to be involved. No payment processor, no marketplace operator,\nno bank, no moderator, no data miner, no nothing. Just you, the person you’re\ntransacting with, and a fully automated two-party escrow system to prevent\nscams.\n\nParticl’s Open Marketplace on Particl Desktop V2This total absence of\nthird-party involvement is completely changing the eCommerce game and is opening\nup a ton of possibilities that simply aren’t possible otherwise. It means that \nfor-profit companies are no longer required for two people to safely transact on\nthe internet. And because no single party runs the Particl marketplace, there is\nno one charging fees to pay for expenses and draw revenue. That’s monumental,\nespecially when you consider that online marketplaces typically charge 5% to up\nto even 50% for the services they offer. A fee that is naturally reflected in\nthe retail price of products and services sold on these marketplaces.\n\nAnd more than just that, Particl also enables this kind of peer-to-peer\neCommerce in a totally private and anonymous way. In fact, a mix of\nprivacy-preserving protocols such as RingCT, CT, stealth addresses, Tor,\nrock-solid encryption, and more, guarantees that you won’t leave any sort of\ndigital footprint behind when shopping or selling online.

Particl is data-free and thus, scandal-free!\n\n> Particl is, put simply, eCommerce 2.0. It is DeCommerce!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIts Evolution Since it Launched\nThe Particl team has pushed a lot of releases to the marketplace since its\ninitial mainnet release on the 12th of August 2019 (Particl Desktop 2.0.0).\nThese releases have seen the addition of several important features and a\nsignificant improvement in all components.\n\nHere are some of the main improvements and added features to the marketplace\nsince its release:\n\n * Questions and answers on listings\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-1-0-released-on-mainnet-1e84cc8716f3]\n * Product/inventory import\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-1-0-released-on-mainnet-1e84cc8716f3]\n * Bitcoin payments\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0]\n * SMSG bots (optional third-party services that can be enabled)\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0]\n * Bid cancellation\n   [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-2-0-released-1a1324881cf8]\n * Listing fee reduction\n   [https://particl.news/adjusting-listing-fees-4b676e230601]\n * Settings [https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-2-0-released-1a1324881cf8]\n * Many UI/UX improvements\n * Many marketplace codebase improvements\n * Many bug fixes\n\nThere is no doubt, the Particl marketplace has progressed smoothly along its \nroadmap [http://particl.io/roadmap/] since its mainnet release. It’s been\nsignificantly improved in performance and feel, and it has also received a bunch\nof new features that are now standard use for any Particl user today.\n\nA Completely New Marketplace and Desktop Application\nSince the release of Bitcoin payments\n[https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0] on\nParticl (Particl Desktop 2.3.0) on the 25th of November, the team has been\nworking on its next major feature release (Particl Desktop 2.4.0) —Multi-Markets\n, or “Infinite Markets” as referenced by some in the community.\n\n> Multi-Markets in a NutshellMulti-Markets add the ability to create and join an\ninfinite number of user-created markets and storefronts on the Particl network.\nIt essentially upgrades the Particl marketplace by connecting it to a wide\nnetwork of user-created markets. This is a major item of Particl’s current \nroadmap [http://particl.io/roadmap/].\n\nInitially, Particl Desktop 2.4.0 was only intended to add the ability to create\nor join an infinite number of markets and storefronts, but since this new\nfeature required so much of the codebase to be changed, it turned into a great\nopportunity to make a major leap forward and as a result, became much bigger\nthan anticipated. Here’s why…\n\nRe-Writing Particl Desktop\nParticl Desktop is already a great cryptocurrency wallet. It looks good, feels\ngood, and does everything, and more, that you’d typically need from a crypto\nwallet. As proof, it has often been forked and adapted by other open-source\nprojects to serve as the main desktop wallet.\n\nBut it’s also starting to show its time. Keep in mind, Particl Desktop is\nalready almost three years old now and the team has acquired a lot of experience\nand knowledge since then.\n\nIt may have been ideal for a simple cryptocurrency wallet and early versions of\nthe marketplace, but it has started to show its limitations when tested against\nsome of the most ambitious features and functionalities of the marketplace such\nas multi-markets.\n\nAnd so, because multi-markets already required so much work to be done to both\nthe marketplace codebase and the desktop application, the Particl team decided\nto completely re-write both of them and take it up to the next level.\n\nAs such, all components of Particl Desktop and most of the marketplace codebase\nhave been significantly improved and are now supported by a new and much more\nmodern codebase.\n\nThis is why the next version of Particl Desktop will now be numbered as Particl\nDesktop 3.0.0 instead of 2.4.0.\n\nAdding More Features Than Initially Planned\nPreview of the Marketplace User Dashboard Coming to Particl Desktop 3.0Along the\nway of re-writing everything, it also became evident that some key features of\nthe marketplace initially planned for later on could actually be integrated into\nthe new codebase right away. This would delay the multi-markets release a bit,\nbut would ultimately save a lot of time further down the road and simplify the\nintegration of the new codebase into the desktop application. This is what the\nteam chose to do in a bid to always offer the highest quality around.\n\nFor this reason, the release of multi-markets has been delayed by a bit longer\nthan initially expected, but far from a delay, it’s given the team the\nopportunity to create a mindblowing product that will change the game of\ndecentralized online commerce.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s New With Particl Desktop 3.0\nParticl Desktop V2 is about to retire and the new kid on the block, V3, is\ncoming fast! More than just a number change, this release changes the entire\nback-end code of the desktop application and introduces several features. It is,\nquite literally, Particl’s biggest upgrade since its mainnet launch almost three\nyears ago.\n\nHere are just some of what to expect from Particl Desktop 3.0:\n\nParticl Desktop\n * A much lighter, faster, more responsive and modern desktop application\n * A modular approach and separation of wallets, markets, and the swap engine\n   into different and independent modules\n * All modules (including marketplace) enabled by default on first startup\n * Massively improved user interface and user experience, more intuitive and \n   user-friendly\n * An almost uncountable number of bug fixes, improvements, and tweaks to most\n   components of the wallet and marketplace (many thanks to all the Particl\n   community for the valuable feedback ❤ )\n * A complete overhaul of the in-app swap engine interface\n * SDK friendly desktop application\n\nMarketplace Improvements\n * Addition of a brand new marketplace user dashboard with advanced\n   notifications and quick access to the main sections of your account\n * Addition of multi-markets and the ability to create an infinity of markets\n   and storefronts\n * Addition of the Market Browser and the ability to browse and join any\n   user-created market or storefront. It’s also possible to promote markets in\n   the Market Browser.\n * Improvements to Question and Answers section of listings — easier access and\n   more comprehensive notifications\n * Addition of user identities and profiles\n * Addition of custom categories which can be set per market or storefront\n * Massive reduction in listing fees, will be reduced by more than 80% of\n   current cost. The cost of listing a product on Particl will then be well\n   under a cent worth of PART\n * Improvements to how Particl Desktop, the marketplace codebase, and the SMSG\n   network interact with each other\n\n> Note: Because the V2 and V3 versions of Particl Desktop and the marketplace are\nso radically different, listings won’t be compatible with each other’s version.\nIn other words, listings published on V3 won’t show up on V2, and vice-versa. Of\ncourse, it’s always possible to revert back to a V2 version of the marketplace\nto complete any outstanding order you may still have.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore to Come After the V3 Release\nThe V3 version of Particl will mark a significant step in Particl’s roadmap\n[http://particl.io/roadmap/] as it will cross off many of its items. It will\nalso serve as the trigger for many other initiatives to come to life.\n\nNew Coins to be Added\nOverhaul of the in-App Swap Engine Interface (Particl Desktop V3)After Particl\nDesktop 3.0 goes live, more cryptocurrencies will be added to the in-app swap\nengine. This will be the best time to show the world what Particl has been up to\nin the last few months and come out with a bang in various cryptocurrency\ncommunities.\n\nEncrypted Messaging System\nCurrently under development by DeMarkets.io [https://demarkets.io/], a\ncompletely distributed, private, and encrypted messaging system will allow you\nto communicate with anyone else in the world.

And because no single party runs the Particl marketplace, there is no one charging fees to pay for expenses and draw revenue. That’s monumental, especially when you consider that <strong>online marketplaces typically charge 5% to up to even 50% for the services they offer</strong>. A fee that is naturally reflected in the retail price of products and services sold on these marketplaces.</p><p>And more than just that, Particl also enables this kind of peer-to-peer eCommerce in a <strong>totally private and anonymous</strong> way.

Particl is data-free and thus, scandal-free!</p><blockquote><strong>Particl is, put simply, eCommerce 2.0. It is DeCommerce!</strong></blockquote><hr><h2 id=\"its-evolution-since-it-launched\">Its Evolution Since it Launched</h2><p>The Particl team has pushed a lot of releases to the marketplace since its initial mainnet release on the <strong>12th of August 2019 (Particl Desktop 2.0.0)</strong>. These releases have seen the addition of several important features and a significant improvement in all components.</p><p>Here are some of the main improvements and added features to the marketplace since its release:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-1-0-released-on-mainnet-1e84cc8716f3\"><strong>Questions and answers on listings</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-1-0-released-on-mainnet-1e84cc8716f3\"><strong>Product/inventory import</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0\"><strong>Bitcoin payments</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0\"><strong>SMSG bots (optional third-party services that can be enabled)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-2-0-released-1a1324881cf8\"><strong>Bid cancellation</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/adjusting-listing-fees-4b676e230601\"><strong>Listing fee reduction</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-2-0-released-1a1324881cf8\"><strong>Settings</strong></a></li><li>Many UI/UX improvements</li><li>Many marketplace codebase improvements</li><li>Many bug fixes</li></ul><p>There is no doubt, the Particl marketplace has progressed smoothly along its <a href=\"http://particl.io/roadmap/\"><strong>roadmap</strong></a><strong> </strong>since its mainnet release. It’s been significantly improved in performance and feel, and it has also received a bunch of new features that are now standard use for any Particl user today.</p><h2 id=\"a-completely-new-marketplace-and-desktop-application\">A Completely New Marketplace and Desktop Application</h2><p>Since the <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0\">release of <strong>Bitcoin payments</strong></a> on Particl (Particl Desktop 2.3.0) on the 25th of November, the team has been working on its next major feature release (Particl Desktop 2.4.0) —<strong> Multi-Markets</strong>, or “<strong>Infinite Markets</strong>” as referenced by some in the community.</p><blockquote><strong>Multi-Markets in a Nutshell</strong>Multi-Markets add the ability to <strong>create and join an infinite number of user-created markets and storefronts</strong> on the Particl network. It essentially upgrades the Particl marketplace by connecting it to a wide network of user-created markets. This is a major item of Particl’s current <a href=\"http://particl.io/roadmap/\"><strong>roadmap</strong></a>.<br></blockquote><p>Initially, <strong>Particl Desktop 2.4.0</strong> was only intended to add the ability to create or join an infinite number of markets and storefronts, but since this new feature required so much of the codebase to be changed, it <strong>turned into a great opportunity to make a major leap forward</strong> and as a result, became much bigger than anticipated. Here’s why…</p><h3 id=\"re-writing-particl-desktop\">Re-Writing Particl Desktop</h3><p>Particl Desktop is already a great cryptocurrency wallet. It looks good, feels good, and does everything, and more, that you’d typically need from a crypto wallet. As proof, it has <strong>often been forked and adapted by other open-source projects</strong> to serve as the main desktop wallet.</p><p>But it’s also starting to show its time. Keep in mind, Particl Desktop is already almost three years old now and the team has acquired a lot of experience and knowledge since then.</p><p>It may have been ideal for a simple cryptocurrency wallet and early versions of the marketplace, but it has started to show its limitations when tested against some of the most ambitious features and functionalities of the marketplace such as multi-markets.</p><p>And so, because multi-markets already required so much work to be done to both the marketplace codebase and the desktop application, the Particl team decided to completely re-write both of them and take it up to the next level.</p><p>As such, all components of Particl Desktop and most of the marketplace codebase have been significantly improved and are now supported by a new and much more modern codebase.</p><p>This is why <strong>the next version of Particl Desktop will now be numbered as Particl Desktop 3.0.0 instead of 2.4.0.</strong></p><h2 id=\"adding-more-features-than-initially-planned\">Adding More Features Than Initially Planned</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Stepping-Things-Up-Again-With-Particl-Desktop-3-0/1-QXCxonxyXy9kQzg7HQS_1g.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Preview of the Marketplace User Dashboard Coming to Particl Desktop 3.0</figcaption></figure><p>Along the way of re-writing everything, it also became evident that some key features of the marketplace initially planned for later on could actually be integrated into the new codebase right away. This would delay the multi-markets release a bit, but would ultimately save a lot of time further down the road and simplify the integration of the new codebase into the desktop application. This is what the team chose to do in a bid to always offer the highest quality around.</p><p>For this reason, the release of multi-markets has been delayed by a bit longer than initially expected, but far from a delay, it’s given the team the opportunity to create a mindblowing product that will change the game of decentralized online commerce.</p><hr><h2 id=\"what-s-new-with-particl-desktop-3-0\">What’s New With Particl Desktop 3.0</h2><p>Particl Desktop V2 is about to retire and the new kid on the block, V3, is coming fast! More than just a number change, this release changes the entire back-end code of the desktop application and introduces several features. It is, quite literally, <strong>Particl’s biggest upgrade since its mainnet launch </strong>almost three years ago.</p><p>Here are just some of what to expect from Particl Desktop 3.0:</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop\"><strong>Particl Desktop</strong></h3><ul><li>A much <strong>lighter</strong>, <strong>faster</strong>, <strong>more responsive</strong> and <strong>modern</strong> desktop application</li><li>A <strong>modular</strong> approach and separation of wallets, markets, and the swap engine into different and independent modules</li><li>All modules (including <strong>marketplace) enabled by default</strong> on first startup</li><li>Massively improved user interface and user experience, more <strong>intuitive</strong> and <strong>user-friendly</strong></li><li>An almost uncountable number of <strong>bug fixes</strong>, <strong>improvements</strong>, and <strong>tweaks to most components</strong> of the wallet and marketplace (many thanks to all the Particl community for the valuable feedback ❤ )</li><li>A complete <strong>overhaul</strong> of the in-app <strong>swap engine interface</strong></li><li><strong>SDK friendly</strong> desktop application</li></ul><h3 id=\"marketplace-improvements\"><strong>Marketplace Improvements</strong></h3><ul><li>Addition of a brand <strong>new marketplace user dashboard</strong> with advanced notifications and quick access to the main sections of your account</li><li>Addition of <strong>multi-markets</strong> and the ability to create an infinity of markets and storefronts</li><li>Addition of the <strong>Market Browser</strong> and the ability to browse and join any user-created market or storefront.

It means that <strong>for-profit companies are no longer required for two people to safely transact on the internet</strong>. And because no single party runs the Particl marketplace, there is no one charging fees to pay for expenses and draw revenue. That’s monumental, especially when you consider that <strong>online marketplaces typically charge 5% to up to even 50% for the services they offer</strong>. A fee that is naturally reflected in the retail price of products and services sold on these marketplaces.</p><p>And more than just that, Particl also enables this kind of peer-to-peer eCommerce in a <strong>totally private and anonymous</strong> way.

Particl is data-free and thus, scandal-free!</p><blockquote><strong>Particl is, put simply, eCommerce 2.0. It is DeCommerce!</strong></blockquote><hr><h2 id=\"its-evolution-since-it-launched\">Its Evolution Since it Launched</h2><p>The Particl team has pushed a lot of releases to the marketplace since its initial mainnet release on the <strong>12th of August 2019 (Particl Desktop 2.0.0)</strong>. These releases have seen the addition of several important features and a significant improvement in all components.</p><p>Here are some of the main improvements and added features to the marketplace since its release:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-1-0-released-on-mainnet-1e84cc8716f3\"><strong>Questions and answers on listings</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-1-0-released-on-mainnet-1e84cc8716f3\"><strong>Product/inventory import</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0\"><strong>Bitcoin payments</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0\"><strong>SMSG bots (optional third-party services that can be enabled)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-2-0-released-1a1324881cf8\"><strong>Bid cancellation</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/adjusting-listing-fees-4b676e230601\"><strong>Listing fee reduction</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-2-0-released-1a1324881cf8\"><strong>Settings</strong></a></li><li>Many UI/UX improvements</li><li>Many marketplace codebase improvements</li><li>Many bug fixes</li></ul><p>There is no doubt, the Particl marketplace has progressed smoothly along its <a href=\"http://particl.io/roadmap/\"><strong>roadmap</strong></a><strong> </strong>since its mainnet release. It’s been significantly improved in performance and feel, and it has also received a bunch of new features that are now standard use for any Particl user today.</p><h2 id=\"a-completely-new-marketplace-and-desktop-application\">A Completely New Marketplace and Desktop Application</h2><p>Since the <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-desktop-2-3-0-released-on-mainnet-ddca8ea1b4b0\">release of <strong>Bitcoin payments</strong></a> on Particl (Particl Desktop 2.3.0) on the 25th of November, the team has been working on its next major feature release (Particl Desktop 2.4.0) —<strong> Multi-Markets</strong>, or “<strong>Infinite Markets</strong>” as referenced by some in the community.</p><blockquote><strong>Multi-Markets in a Nutshell</strong>Multi-Markets add the ability to <strong>create and join an infinite number of user-created markets and storefronts</strong> on the Particl network. It essentially upgrades the Particl marketplace by connecting it to a wide network of user-created markets. This is a major item of Particl’s current <a href=\"http://particl.io/roadmap/\"><strong>roadmap</strong></a>.<br></blockquote><p>Initially, <strong>Particl Desktop 2.4.0</strong> was only intended to add the ability to create or join an infinite number of markets and storefronts, but since this new feature required so much of the codebase to be changed, it <strong>turned into a great opportunity to make a major leap forward</strong> and as a result, became much bigger than anticipated. Here’s why…</p><h3 id=\"re-writing-particl-desktop\">Re-Writing Particl Desktop</h3><p>Particl Desktop is already a great cryptocurrency wallet. It looks good, feels good, and does everything, and more, that you’d typically need from a crypto wallet. As proof, it has <strong>often been forked and adapted by other open-source projects</strong> to serve as the main desktop wallet.</p><p>But it’s also starting to show its time. Keep in mind, Particl Desktop is already almost three years old now and the team has acquired a lot of experience and knowledge since then.</p><p>It may have been ideal for a simple cryptocurrency wallet and early versions of the marketplace, but it has started to show its limitations when tested against some of the most ambitious features and functionalities of the marketplace such as multi-markets.</p><p>And so, because multi-markets already required so much work to be done to both the marketplace codebase and the desktop application, the Particl team decided to completely re-write both of them and take it up to the next level.</p><p>As such, all components of Particl Desktop and most of the marketplace codebase have been significantly improved and are now supported by a new and much more modern codebase.</p><p>This is why <strong>the next version of Particl Desktop will now be numbered as Particl Desktop 3.0.0 instead of 2.4.0.</strong></p><h2 id=\"adding-more-features-than-initially-planned\">Adding More Features Than Initially Planned</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Stepping-Things-Up-Again-With-Particl-Desktop-3-0/1-QXCxonxyXy9kQzg7HQS_1g.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Preview of the Marketplace User Dashboard Coming to Particl Desktop 3.0</figcaption></figure><p>Along the way of re-writing everything, it also became evident that some key features of the marketplace initially planned for later on could actually be integrated into the new codebase right away. This would delay the multi-markets release a bit, but would ultimately save a lot of time further down the road and simplify the integration of the new codebase into the desktop application. This is what the team chose to do in a bid to always offer the highest quality around.</p><p>For this reason, the release of multi-markets has been delayed by a bit longer than initially expected, but far from a delay, it’s given the team the opportunity to create a mindblowing product that will change the game of decentralized online commerce.</p><hr><h2 id=\"what-s-new-with-particl-desktop-3-0\">What’s New With Particl Desktop 3.0</h2><p>Particl Desktop V2 is about to retire and the new kid on the block, V3, is coming fast! More than just a number change, this release changes the entire back-end code of the desktop application and introduces several features. It is, quite literally, <strong>Particl’s biggest upgrade since its mainnet launch </strong>almost three years ago.</p><p>Here are just some of what to expect from Particl Desktop 3.0:</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop\"><strong>Particl Desktop</strong></h3><ul><li>A much <strong>lighter</strong>, <strong>faster</strong>, <strong>more responsive</strong> and <strong>modern</strong> desktop application</li><li>A <strong>modular</strong> approach and separation of wallets, markets, and the swap engine into different and independent modules</li><li>All modules (including <strong>marketplace) enabled by default</strong> on first startup</li><li>Massively improved user interface and user experience, more <strong>intuitive</strong> and <strong>user-friendly</strong></li><li>An almost uncountable number of <strong>bug fixes</strong>, <strong>improvements</strong>, and <strong>tweaks to most components</strong> of the wallet and marketplace (many thanks to all the Particl community for the valuable feedback ❤ )</li><li>A complete <strong>overhaul</strong> of the in-app <strong>swap engine interface</strong></li><li><strong>SDK friendly</strong> desktop application</li></ul><h3 id=\"marketplace-improvements\"><strong>Marketplace Improvements</strong></h3><ul><li>Addition of a brand <strong>new marketplace user dashboard</strong> with advanced notifications and quick access to the main sections of your account</li><li>Addition of <strong>multi-markets</strong> and the ability to create an infinity of markets and storefronts</li><li>Addition of the <strong>Market Browser</strong> and the ability to browse and join any user-created market or storefront. It’s also possible to <strong>promote markets</strong> in the Market Browser.</li><li>Improvements to <strong>Question and Answers</strong> section of listings — easier access and more comprehensive notifications</li><li>Addition of <strong>user identities and profiles</strong></li><li>Addition of <strong>custom categories</strong> which can be set per market or storefront</li><li><strong>Massive reduction in listing fees</strong>, will be reduced by <strong>more than 80%</strong> of current cost. The cost of listing a product on Particl will then be well under a cent worth of PART</li><li>Improvements to how Particl Desktop, the marketplace codebase, and the <strong>SMSG network</strong> interact with each other</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Because the V2 and V3 versions of Particl Desktop and the marketplace are so radically different, listings won’t be compatible with each other’s version. In other words, <strong>listings published on V3 won’t show up on V2, and vice-versa</strong>. Of course, it’s always possible to revert back to a V2 version of the marketplace to complete any outstanding order you may still have.</blockquote><hr><h2 id=\"more-to-come-after-the-v3-release\">More to Come After the V3 Release</h2><p>The V3 version of Particl will mark a significant step in Particl’s <a href=\"http://particl.io/roadmap/\"><strong>roadmap</strong></a> as it will cross off many of its items. It will also serve as the trigger for many other initiatives to come to life.</p><h3 id=\"new-coins-to-be-added\">New Coins to be Added</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Stepping-Things-Up-Again-With-Particl-Desktop-3-0/1-SJZ9GGOaE8vBgLhB82hyMw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Overhaul of the in-App Swap Engine Interface (Particl Desktop V3)</figcaption></figure><p>After Particl Desktop 3.0 goes live, <strong>more cryptocurrencies will be added</strong> to the in-app swap engine.

The Particl team, along with a few outstanding\ncommunity contributors, have been working tirelessly in preparation for the\nrelease of Particl’s biggest update to date: Particl Desktop 2.4.0 (Infinite\nMarkets). How does all that work translate into real-life?\n\n * A significantly bigger release than initially expected — more user-friendly,\n   more features, and a more efficient back-end\n * Groundworks laid for outreach at scale\n * Ease the community into marketing Particl at scale\n * Support sellers and help them recognize Particl as an additional sales\n   channel that can benefit their business\n\nNot only has development been progressing very well, but the last few weeks have\nalso been very instrumental in laying solid foundations that will make Particl’s\nadoption as easy as it’s ever been.\n\nIn this update, we’ll break down everything that’s been happening. It is also\nthe perfect opportunity to reveal a few surprises that have been in the works\nfor some time now. So get ready, because this Project Update is going to be a\ncool one!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable of Contents (Click Me!)\n * Development Update\n * More Frequent Updates\n * Particl Academy\n * New Official Website and Messaging Strategy\n * Vendor Onboarding Program\n * New Coins and Exchanges Coming Up on Particl\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDevelopment Update\nTo refresh your mind, here are the most noteworthy items that are going to be\nintroduced in Particl Desktop 2.4.0.\n\n * Listing fees reduced by 80% or more\n * Infinite Markets & Market Management\n * Identity Management and seller profiles\n * Significant performance boost\n * More lightweight Particl Desktop client\n * The marketplace now enabled by default on first startup\n * Various user-interface and user-experience improvements\n * (NEW) A surprise feature currently being integrated (roadmap item)\n\nIn the last Development Update\n[https://particl.news/development-update-02-03-2020-c907679ded8f], it was\nmentioned the new market codebase was mostly ready and going through various\nrounds of testing designed to find any issue within the code. Well, a LOT has\nhappened since then and there’s a lot to say about it, so without further ado,\nlet’s dive right into it.\n\nMarketplace\nNew Marketplace Overview Page (WIP)As you already know, the market codebase has\nbeen going through a major refactoring process since the last Particl Desktop\nupdate. And while the integration tests have been generally positive, they have\nhighlighted a few key opportunities to add more components and improve on the\nnew ones before going live.\n\nThe team has immediately started working on these items which are resulting in\nmore changes being made to the codebase. The end result will be a much more \nefficient and future-proof foundation that will make features better and\neasier/faster to integrate.\n\nIt will also translate in a much bigger update than initially anticipated.\n\nThese new changes are necessary for Particl to move forward and quickly tackle\nits roadmap. Case in point, it’s already enabling a few surprise features that\nwere initially planned for much later during Beta.\n\nIt’s unclear yet exactly how many of these surprise features will be ready in\ntime for Particl Desktop 2.4.0, but stay alert because you might be impressed at\nhow fast they’ll end up going live.\n\nFor now, what they are will remain a mystery, but watch out as they might be\nrevealed very soon in one of the now regular development updates (keep reading\nfor more info on this).\n\nParticl Desktop\nMarket Browser — Empty (WIP)As mentioned in the previous Development Update,\nParticl Desktop is also being completely re-written from scratch. That means all\nof its back-end code is now different and, quite frankly, much more modern than\nany previous Particl Desktop version. That means it will now look slightly\ndifferent, be more responsive, faster, lighter, and just overall better!\n\nThe progress made on the development of the new Particl Desktop client is\nactually quite far ahead. The codebase has been complete for a while now and the\n“wiring” of the front-end client to the back-end (the market codebase) is\nprogressing smoothly.\n\nTweaks and minor improvements to the user interface are still being made at this\ntime and will be ongoing up until the mainnet release of Particl Desktop 2.4.0.\n\nIn-App Swap Engine\nChanges have also been made to the in-app “exchange module” to easily allow new\ncoins and exchanges to be added or removed on the fly without requiring any\nParticl Desktop update. The update is currently being tested and the team is\nputting the final fixes to the engine.\n\nThese changes are mandatory for what comes next for Particl. Keep reading this\nProject Update to learn more about when new coins and exchanges will be added to\nParticl.\n\n> Note: For simplicity, Particl’s in-app “exchange module” is now going to be\nreferred to as the swap engine, or in-app swap engine.\nETA for Testnet Release\nWallet Overview Page (WIP)Since the last development update\n[https://particl.news/development-update-02-03-2020-c907679ded8f], a significant\namount of additional work has been accomplished by Particl’s developers and\nthere’s more left to be completed. That only means Particl Desktop 2.4.0 will be\na much bigger update than initially anticipated. It will be faster, lighter, and \npack many, many more features and functionalities.\n\nFor all these reasons, it’s difficult to estimate exactly how long it will still\ntake for the testnet build to be ready. As it stands today, internal builds of\nthe new Particl Desktop client, with the marketplace, are working well for the\nmost part. However, it may still take a few weeks before the testnet build is\nready for community-wide testing. This, of course, ultimately depends on how the\nvarious code testing rounds go.\n\nBut don’t worry, it only means good things. While it may take longer than\nexpected to see the release of this update, the many changes currently being\nmade to Particl will allow some of the roadmap items that were planned for later\nduring Beta to be integrated much faster. That means it will significantly\nreduce the time between the release of future feature updates and make the\noverall user experience of the marketplace better, something that definitely\nhelps with user adoption.\n\nSo hang tight! Every day brings us closer to the testnet release. This will be a\nmoment that will profoundly change the game for Particl, and one that might have\njust as much impact, if not more, as the first-ever mainnet release of the\nmarketplace.\n\nMore Frequent Updates\nIn recent months, the Particl team has made the decision to start developing\nParticl in private repositories to protect its work from copy-cats and scam\nprojects. What this means is that, while all of Particl’s released code is\npublicly available (minus the Particl Desktop client), the unreleased code is\nnow kept private.\n\nUnfortunately, it also means that it’s now almost impossible to track the\ndevelopment progress by yourself. Whereas Particl’s Github used to be buzzing\nwith activity, it is now pretty quiet…publicly quiet at least (remember, it’s\nthe calm before the storm!).\n\nFor this reason, and to strive for as much transparency as possible, Particl is\nnow going to start making more regular development updates. That’ll allow you to\ntrack the development progress more pro-actively and understand more precisely\nthe status of the project at any given time.\n\nThe new development updates will be published both here on Particl.news\n[http://Particl.news] and on the #Progress-updates channel of Particl’s Discord\n[https://discord.me/particl] server.\n\nParticl Academy\nLaunching during the Particl Desktop 2.4.0 testnet phase and prior to the\nmainnet release, the Particl Academy is a new documentation hub containing all\nthe information you’ll ever need on Particl from both a vendor’s and a user’s\nperspective.\n\nIt includes step-by-step user guides for everything, in-depth guides about some\nParticl’s core components, FAQs, troubleshooting, documentation, and all the \nbasic instructions to get anyone started with Particl in no time.\n\nMaybe more importantly, the Particl Academy is written in human language. Forget\nall the crypto technical mumbo jumbo, all that stuff is moving to Particl’s Wiki\npage. The Particl Academy is an easy to follow interactive user manual meant to\nexplain what is Particl and how to use it in a way that anyone can understand,\nregardless of their “technical level”.\n\n> Pro-tip: When it goes live, it would be well advised to always link to the\nParticl Academy whenever trying to get someone new to try or look into Particl.\nThat’ll allow them to quickly put the pieces together and get started in just a\nfew minutes!\nNew Official Website and Messaging Strategy\nParticl is refining its message using a three-pronged approach, and with that\ncomes a few changes to where new users usually get their first point-of-contact.\n\nThe Official Website\nIn the first place, Particl’s website is getting a significant overhaul both in\nterms of content, look, and purpose. More than just a simple refresh, the new\nwebsite will look and feel completely different and will now focus on the\nmarketplace.\n\nIn fact, the website is usually what people usually first come across when\nsearching for Particl. For this reason, it needs to quickly explain what Particl\nis and how it can make that person’s life better. This needs to be made as clear\nand straightforward as possible. The official website is all about what’s\nParticl and how it’ll make your life better.\n\nParticl Wiki\nIn the second place, all the technical and crypto-focused information will be\nmoved to the Particl Wiki to make room for a simpler and more effective message\non the website. That means Particl’s Wiki page now becomes the main place to get\nall the deeper technical information that crypto fans might usually be\ninterested in. The Particl Wiki is all about how Particl works and its\nunderlying technologies (blockchain, P2P, etc).\n\nParticl Academy\nAnd finally, the Particl Academy comes in as the third and final piece to the\npuzzle. It’s the informative hub, the interactive user manual. It contains all\nthe basic information and instructions required to use Particl to its full\nextent. It’s also written in a way that anyone can understand and is meant to\nmake onboarding new users a much easier task. The Particl Academy is all about\nhow to use Particl in a way anyone can understand.\n\nWith that strategy, it now becomes easy to redirect new people to the right\nplace depending on a few factors such as their technical level or what they want\nto do/know about Particl.\n\nThe bottom line is…this methodical separation of the messaging into three main\nplatforms will allow anyone in the community to spread the Particl word as\nefficiently as ever and see better results with fewer efforts!\n\nVendor Onboarding Program\nThe Vendor Onboarding Program (VOP) is a program designed to help make the\nprocess of onboarding new sellers easier and help them make their first steps in\nthe world of decentralized eCommerce. It also provides all the tools required\nfor anyone to actively participate in reaching out and getting new sellers to\njoin Particl.\n\nThe “VOP” has two main objectives.\n\n * To help and support new sellers getting started on Particl\n * To make it easier and more efficient for anyone to reach out to online\n   sellers\n\nTo help and support new sellers, the VOP will provide added benefits and perks\nto sellers who opt to register to the program. These include the funding of\nlisting fees, the promotion of markets and storefronts, access to VIP channels,\npersonalized support, more exposure within Particl’s community, and many more\nbenefits that will be revealed at a later time.\n\nAll of these benefits are pre-packaged into an easy-to-join program that can be\nlinked by anyone in the community. Combined with the Particl Academy, it\ncompletely takes away the burden of walking a new seller through the whole\nprocess of explaining what’s Particl, how it can benefit them, how to use it,\nwhere to seek for help, and etc. All that’s left for you to do is to find online\nsellers you think would be a good fit on Particl and point them in the right\ndirection (the Particl Academy and the VOP).\n\nUltimately, a better and more structured onboarding process only leads to more\nsellers joining the platform, which inevitably means more products and diversity\nof choice on the marketplace.\n\nMore details about the VOP and how it will all work will be shared shortly with\nthe community in a blog post of its own.\n\nNew Coins and Exchanges Accepted on Particl ?\nThe mainnet release of Particl Desktop 2.4.0 is an important milestone for the\nproject. It is the completion of a multi-year long vision that initially aimed\nat providing a decentralized, trustless, and private eCommerce protocol that\nallows anyone to create its own market. And with the new shiny Particl Desktop\ngoing live on mainnet, now will be the time to finally show off Particl to the\nrest of the world!\n\nAs such, after Particl Desktop 2.4.0’s mainnet release, Particl will start\nadding new coins and exchanges to its swap engine, opening the marketplace to an\nunlimited number of cryptocurrency users and communities. In fact, it will now\nbe possible to add or remove coins and exchange on the fly without requiring any\nParticl Desktop update.\n\nAre there specific coins that you would like to use on Particl? Or maybe you\nthink a specific cryptocurrency community might benefit greatly from\ndecentralized eCommerce? Now’s the time to start thinking and talking about it!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinally, we would like to thank the entire Particl community for all the recent\nefforts put into the many community-led initiatives and in spreading the word\nabout Particl. Let’s just say this, getting more people to try Particl is about\nto get a whole lot easier for everyone with everything that’s coming up,\nincluding Particl Desktop 2.4.0, the Particl Academy, the VOP, the new website,\nand etc. All of your efforts are about to reap more results! ?","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Project-Update--22-04-2020-/1-lUw_dvIR7xVR-IcTt2IZSw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"dev-updates-new-website-particl-academy-new-coins-and-more-\">Dev Updates, New Website, Particl Academy, New Coins, and More! ?</h3><p>In the past few weeks, Particl has been going through what can only be described as the “calm before the storm”.

Well, a LOT has happened since then and there’s a lot to say about it, so without further ado, let’s dive right into it.</p><h3 id=\"marketplace\">Marketplace</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Project-Update--22-04-2020-/1-eSMJ4GdGZvdIQnzPgCbNIg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>New Marketplace Overview Page (WIP)</figcaption></figure><p>As you already know, the market codebase has been going through a <strong>major refactoring process </strong>since the last Particl Desktop update. And while the integration tests have been generally positive, they have highlighted a few <strong>key opportunities to add more components and improve</strong> on the new ones before going live.</p><p>The team has immediately started working on these items which are resulting in more changes being made to the codebase. The end result will be a much more <strong>efficient</strong> and <strong>future-proof</strong> foundation that will <strong>make features better and easier/faster to integrate</strong>.</p><p>It will also translate in a <strong>much bigger update than initially anticipated</strong>.</p><p>These new changes are necessary for Particl to move forward and quickly tackle its roadmap. Case in point, <strong>it’s already enabling a few surprise features</strong> that were initially planned for much later during Beta.</p><p>It’s unclear yet exactly how many of these surprise features will be ready in time for Particl Desktop 2.4.0, but stay alert because you might be impressed at how fast they’ll end up going live.</p><p>For now, what they are will remain a mystery, but watch out as they might be revealed very soon in one of the now <strong>regular development updates</strong> (keep reading for more info on this).</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop\">Particl Desktop</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Project-Update--22-04-2020-/1-pHLB-RaXJ3c5SYFInHVx7w.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Market Browser — Empty (WIP)</figcaption></figure><p>As mentioned in the previous Development Update, Particl Desktop is also being <strong>completely re-written from scratch</strong>. That means all of its back-end code is now different and, quite frankly, much more modern than any previous Particl Desktop version. That means it will now <strong>look slightly different</strong>, be <strong>more responsive</strong>, <strong>faster</strong>, <strong>lighter</strong>, and just overall <strong>better</strong>!</p><p>The progress made on the development of the new Particl Desktop client is actually quite far ahead. The codebase has been complete for a while now and the “wiring” of the front-end client to the back-end (the market codebase) is progressing smoothly.</p><p>Tweaks and minor improvements to the user interface are still being made at this time and will be ongoing up until the mainnet release of Particl Desktop 2.4.0.</p><h3 id=\"in-app-swap-engine\">In-App Swap Engine</h3><p>Changes have also been made to the in-app “exchange module” to easily <strong>allow new coins and exchanges to be added or removed on the fly without requiring any Particl Desktop update</strong>. The update is currently being tested and the team is putting the final fixes to the engine.</p><p>These changes are mandatory for what comes next for Particl. Keep reading this Project Update to learn more about when new coins and exchanges will be added to Particl.</p><blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> For simplicity, Particl’s in-app “exchange module” is now going to be referred to as the swap engine, or in-app swap engine.</blockquote><h3 id=\"eta-for-testnet-release\">ETA for Testnet Release</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Project-Update--22-04-2020-/1-_4dOslujM4x53mDhARV_QA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Wallet Overview Page (WIP)</figcaption></figure><p>Since the last <a href=\"https://particl.news/development-update-02-03-2020-c907679ded8f\">development update</a>, a significant amount of additional work has been accomplished by Particl’s developers and there’s more left to be completed. That only means Particl Desktop 2.4.0 will be a much bigger update than initially anticipated. It will be <strong>faster</strong>, <strong>lighter</strong>, and <strong>pack many, many more features and functionalities</strong>.</p><p>For all these reasons, it’s difficult to estimate exactly how long it will still take for the testnet build to be ready. As it stands today, internal builds of the new Particl Desktop client, with the marketplace, are working well for the most part. However, <strong>it may still take a few weeks</strong> before the testnet build is ready for community-wide testing. This, of course, ultimately depends on how the various code testing rounds go.</p><p>But don’t worry, it only means good things. While it may take longer than expected to see the release of this update, the many changes currently being made to Particl will allow some of the roadmap items that were planned for later during Beta to be integrated much faster. That means it will significantly reduce the time between the release of future feature updates and make the overall user experience of the marketplace better, something that definitely helps with user adoption.</p><p>So hang tight! Every day brings us closer to the testnet release. This will be a moment that will profoundly change the game for Particl, and one that might have just as much impact, if not more, as the first-ever mainnet release of the marketplace.</p><h2 id=\"more-frequent-updates\">More Frequent Updates</h2><p>In recent months, the Particl team has made the decision to start developing Particl in <strong>private repositories</strong> to protect its work from copy-cats and scam projects.

What this means is that you can\nnow store, send, receive, and swap PART for any of the other available assets\nwithin Flare Wallet’s ecosystem. Flare Wallet is a non-custodial wallet, meaning\nthat their team doesn’t have access to your private keys at all, and is\navailable on both mobile and desktop platforms.\n\nFlare Wallet | Privacy Focused Cryptocurrency Wallet [https://flarewallet.io/]\nSecure privacy focused cryptocurrency wallet for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin\nand\nmany more.flarewallet.io [https://flarewallet.io/]\n\nTeamwork Within Privacy & Security Focused Projects\nThe addition of PART into Flare Wallet is an encouraging story amidst an\nindustry that has unfortunately turned increasingly “pay-to-play”. When one\nstand up Particl community member (thanks to CaptainSkywalker) reached out to\nthe Flare Wallet team, their team took the time to dive into Particl to see what\nit was all about. They then reached out to the Particl team with an interest in\nlisting the coin solely based on the nature (especially its focus on privacy and\nsecurity), vision, and constant development of the project.\n\nThe Flare Wallet team never asked for a listing fee or a portion of the supply.\nThey instead reached out simply to ask whether the Particl team would be okay\nwith getting PART added to their ecosystem and inquired about a few technical\nquestions.\n\nFor this reason, Cryptoguard opened up a donation bounty for any Particl\ncommunity member to show their appreciation to Flare Wallet’s approach to\nworking with other privacy and security projects, as opposed to straight up\nasking for a listing fee payment regardless of the nature of the project. At the\ntime of this writing, the donation address has accumulated a total of ~2,745\nPART and will be transferred, today, to the Flare Wallet team.\n\nThis also highlights how effective a community can be.

We’re all in\nthis together as a big family! ?\n\nFlare Wallet — One Solution for Atomic Swaps on Particl’s Marketplace?\nWhile Flare Wallet’s swap services currently work by leveraging third-party\npartners’ services (i.e. StealthEx), their team is actively working towards\nimplementing atomic swaps into their engine so that swaps conducted on their\nwallet would be entirely trustless (as in, no middleman required to execute a\nswap). This was a development both the Flare Wallet and Particl teams found very\ninteresting as it relates to Particl’s marketplace.\n\nAs it currently stands, Particl’s marketplace only accepts BTC (and of course,\nPART) through SimpleSwap [https://simpleswap.io], but it is entirely possible to\nadd more coins using many different swap services. That means that, once Flare\nWallet successfully pushes atomic swap style swaps in production, it could\neasily be integrated into Particl’s marketplace and Particl Desktop client.\n\nOf course, Particl’s Lead Core Developer and Cryptographer, Tecnovert, has been\nworking on his own implementation of atomic swaps, but as you already know,\nParticl has an agnostic approach to such services on its platform. An additional\natomic swap solution is very much appreciated as it would increase\ndecentralization ever more (in that case, by adding more options, thus making\nthe overall platform more resilient) and by bringing more volume and liquidity\nthrough Flare Wallet’s reach within their own community as well as the greater\ncryptocurrency community. After all, Flare Wallet is a relatively well-known\nwallet within the industry and has a good level of brand recognition.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore About Flare Wallet\nFlare is a multi-asset privacy focused cryptocurrency light wallet. All keys are\nmanaged locally and completely secured and encrypted by the end-user with a\nsimple 12 seed mnemonic phrase backup. There are no servers that manage your\nwallets for you — you control everything. We believe it is important to create a\nwallet interface that is both fashionable and simple to use while giving it as\nmuch power as possible. Being a multi-currency privacy focused wallet, it will\nalso include and focus on several privacy/security features:\n\n * Networking privacy: Flare will have the option of being routed through Tor\n   networking to give users the best possible network privacy when\n   sending/receiving/swapping.\n * Coin-Control support (after beta): Flare will give users the ability to\n   control their inputs for each transaction for coins that utilize UTXO sets.\n   Benefits of this will be outlined below.\n * Decentralized privacy swaps (after beta): Flare will allow users to swap\n   their coins within the wallet using decentralized methods while using the \n   NIX\n   protocol [https://nixplatform.io]to break the linkage between swaps.\n * Hardware wallet support (after beta): Being able to use your Ledger/Trezor\n   for supported coins within the wallet to ensure the highest possible asset\n   security.\n\nFor users who value their privacy, Flare will give the best support possible in\nany multi-currency wallet available. For users who are just looking for a secure\nwallet that supports/will support many popular coins for them to store their\nholdings, Flare will do just the job.

Then just CLICK HERE and\njump\nstraight to it! [https://particl.io/roadmap/]\nIn the past two weeks, we’ve taken a deep dive into Particl’s current status.\nWe’ve reviewed all of last year’s accomplishments for the project\n[https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819] and how its\nOpen Marketplace has evolved since being released\n[https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02] on\nmainnet in August 2019. If there’s one thing that’s for sure, it’s that Particl\nis moving full steam ahead!\n\nHowever, the marketplace’s level of adoption, compared to the overwhelming\namount of development the team puts into it, also highlights a very important\nfact — the cryptocurrency industry has matured to the point where getting\nblockchain products into people’s hands is now what matters, not just delivering\nnew and exotic code alone. Yes, your product is perhaps groundbreaking, but it\nneeds to be used by “real” people for it to be worth anything in the “real\nworld”.\n\nLuckily, that’s always been the vision behind Particl, so this shift in\nmentality from hype to real-world use-cases is precisely where the blockchain\nindustry needs to move towards for Particl to become successful.\n\nIndeed, the project’s current team [https://particl.io/team] and advisory board\n[https://particl.io/team] are composed of old-school crypto developers,\nlong-time online sellers, and veterans within the payment industry who see, in\nblockchain and distributed technologies, the opportunity to completely disrupt\nglobal eCommerce and dramatically improve it for all involved parties by taking\nout the need to do business through middlemen — something simply not possible\nwhen relying on traditional, web 2.0 technologies.\n\nIn other words, Particl was not formed and isn’t being developed because\nblockchain is the new cool kid in town. No, it’s because its novel technology is\nbound to have a profound impact on an industry (eCommerce) in dire need of\nimprovements.\n\nThe Path Towards a Greater Adoption of Particl’s Marketplace\nParticl’s Open Marketplace may be live on mainnet, but it’s still Beta software.\nFor that reason, it may still be rough around the edges, lacking a few features,\nor seem more complicated to use than your typical online marketplace. And that’s\nall normal — it’s nowhere near its intended first version (that comes after\nBeta).\n\nTo that end, four main reasons why people may not want to use the marketplace in\nits current form have been identified in a previous blog post\n[https://particl.news/the-way-forward-1fa903fff430].\n\n * Missing features\n * Required improvements on some features/functions\n * Required improvements on the marketplace’s performance and stability\n * Required improvements to the user interface (UI) and experience (UX)\n\nThe good news is…the marketplace’s adoption is not on the slow-side of things\nbecause it doesn’t provide any benefit over traditional online marketplaces, \nquite to the contrary\n[https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02#767d]\n. No, it’s rather simply because Particl isn’t “adoption-ready” yet.\n\nThat’s precisely with “making Particl adoption-ready” in mind that the Particl\nteam is proud to release, today, its new development roadmap for 2020 and\nbeyond! What’s scheduled to be improved? What features are planned to be\nintegrated? Just keep reading and that’ll be no mystery to you by the end of\nthis article!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe New Roadmap is Here!\nParticl’s new roadmap is designed with one goal in mind: eliminate the barriers\nto entry and make Particl’s Open Marketplace “adoption-ready”. In other words, \neach roadmap item is there for a very specific reason, which is explained in\ndetail in the Why? section of the roadmap.\n\nTo better plan ahead, it has also been separated into three different\ncategories, each representing a different “phase” of adoption: Core Features,\nInnovators and Early Adopters. Each phase targets different types of users and\nhas its own development requirements. To understand the categorization of items,\nit is important to first understand the “product adoption curve”. It represents,\nby user volume, the adoption curve of product throughout its lifespan.\n\nThe more roadmap items within a certain “phase category” are completed, the more\nlikely it is that its targeted users will start using the marketplace. It also\nmakes the onboarding process increasingly easier.\n\nBefore getting down to the roadmap itself, let’s highlight a few important\npoints:\n\n * The roadmap is not binding, meaning that items could be added, taken out, or\n   see their scope change at any time.\n * There is no timeline associated with the roadmap. It shows what the team\n   plans on working on in 2020 and beyond, but no deadline or ETA is provided,\n   at least for the moment.\n * The items, although separated in adoption phases, are not ordered in any\n   particular way. That means items near the top of the roadmap won’t\n   necessarily be delivered before items near the end of it.\n * The roadmap doesn’t include ALL of the items that have been discussed by the\n   Particl team due to the fact that some of them are more minor in scope. These\n   will be integrated on Particl Desktop from time to time in various releases.\n * While not specifically mentioned in the roadmap, general performance and\n   UI/UX improvements are expected to be included with most releases. This is an\n   ongoing process that will go on all throughout Beta and even after it.\n\nWithout further ado, let’s jump right into the new development roadmap for 2020\nand beyond!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCore Marketplace Layer / Key Features\nThis stage of adoption has been limited mostly to the core Particl community due\nto the product itself (the marketplace) being so early in development and\navailable features. It’s been a phase where the marketplace became reality, but\nstill lacked a lot of very basic features and required improvements to attract\nnew users. At that stage, the entire project is still considered experimental\nand probably even closer to an Alpha software rather than a Beta. Even though\nthe marketplace is live on mainnet, it is still very much a testing phase (and\nthanks to YOU for being part of this very early but immensely important phase ? \n).\n\nMore information about this phase can be found in previous articles that have\nrecently been posted on Particl.news (1\n[https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819], 2\n[https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02], 3\n[https://particl.news/the-way-forward-1fa903fff430]).\n\nThe key features here are the ability to create and join an infinite number of\nmarkets, the customization of your identities on those markets, and do all of\nthat for next to no fee.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInnovators Stage of Adoption\nIf you’re reading this, you’re part of the innovators. This adoption stage is\nwhen it starts getting interesting and when we see the first few blips of\norganic adoption. It is at this moment that new features and improvements will\nslowly start making the marketplace “adoption-ready” for the innovator type of\npeople.\n\n“Innovators” are people that want to keep up with cutting edge technology and\nhave generally strong aptitudes for technical processes. They are passionate\nabout new technology and want to be the first to try it. At this stage, users\nthat start using Particl are still considered “pioneers” as they are willing to\nignore some missing elements, contribute towards improving the project (i.e.\ngiving valuable feedback), and deal with more complicated flows that they know\nwill improve over time, but they are also the people that will kickstart\nParticl’s “closed-loop” economy by making real online commerce.\n\nIn the specific case of Particl’s Open Marketplace, this stage of adoption is\nlikely to attract cryptocurrency enthusiasts, privacy advocates, and\nparticipants of various niche industries in need of what Particl offers (because\nthey can’t find it elsewhere).\n\nThis phase is PACKED with deliverables, but here are some particularly\ninteresting ones:\n\n * The fine-tuning of the Escrow (rate, optionality, …)\n * The possibility to run decentralized private auctions\n * A messaging system between buyers and sellers\n * The development SDK (for developers)\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEarly Adopters Phase of Adoption\nAfter the innovators come the early adopters. As its name implies, early\nadopters are still early into the game but their numbers are considerably higher\nthan innovators.\n\nInstead of coming around due to the novelty of a platform or because they have a\nvery urgent need for it, they start using the platform because they see it as\nproviding them with a dramatic strategic advantage not possible to have on other\nplatforms and not yet leveraged by their competitors. These people have all\nsorts of strategic applications and are creative in how they will use new\ntechnologies to their end. They’re also somewhat tolerant ofrisks as they know\nthe rewards can potentially be a game-changer for them. Whereas innovators tend\nto be fine rushing in, testing out the platform, and help find its pain points,\nearly adopters expect a much more “adoption-ready” platform with as little\nproblems as possible (although they do expect the platform to not be 100%\nready).\n\nIn the specific case of Particl, this stage will likely attract the more\naggressive and opportunistic types of sellers and enterprises. This phase is\nmuch closer to being mainstream-ready, although it is not quite there yet.\n\n> Note: This section of the roadmap is preliminary. More items will be added to it\nas we inch closer to this phase of adoption.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinal Note\nIf you would like to help with Particl’s development and contribute to one of\nthe items within the roadmap, feel free to contact the team on any of the\nchannels available (Telegram, Discord, Riot, Reddit, etc) or by email\n[http://particl.io/team/].\n\nIf you would instead like to help out on getting new users onboard, then feel\nfree to contact Cryptoguard on any of the channels available (Telegram, Discord,\nRiot, Reddit, etc).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/New-Development-Roadmap-Released-/1-zT-RLkPxcPnGTA0LSE5X8A.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><h3 id=\"new-decade-new-way-to-do-ecommerce-\">New Decade, New Way to do eCommerce! ?</h3><blockquote><a href=\"https://particl.io/roadmap/\"><strong>Want to see the new development roadmap right now?

We’ve reviewed all of <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819\"><strong>last year’s accomplishments for the project</strong></a><strong> </strong>and <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02\"><strong>how its Open Marketplace has evolved since being released</strong></a> on mainnet in August 2019. If there’s one thing that’s for sure, it’s that Particl is moving full steam ahead!</p><p>However, the marketplace’s level of adoption, compared to the overwhelming amount of development the team puts into it, also highlights a very important fact — the cryptocurrency industry has matured to the point where getting blockchain products into people’s hands is now what matters, not just delivering new and exotic code alone. Yes, your product is perhaps groundbreaking, but it needs to be used by “real” people for it to be worth anything in the “real world”.</p><p>Luckily, that’s always been the vision behind Particl, so this shift in mentality from hype to real-world use-cases is <strong>precisely where the blockchain industry needs to move towards for Particl to become successful</strong>.</p><p>Indeed, <a href=\"https://particl.io/team\"><strong>the project’s current team</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://particl.io/team\"><strong>advisory board</strong></a> are composed of old-school crypto developers, long-time online sellers, and veterans within the payment industry who see, in blockchain and distributed technologies, the opportunity to completely disrupt global eCommerce and dramatically improve it for all involved parties by taking out the need to do business through middlemen — something simply not possible when relying on traditional, web 2.0 technologies.</p><p>In other words, Particl was not formed and isn’t being developed because blockchain is the new cool kid in town.

For that reason, it may still be rough around the edges, lacking a few features, or seem more complicated to use than your typical online marketplace. And that’s all normal — it’s nowhere near its intended first version (that comes after Beta).</p><p>To that end, four main reasons why people may not want to use the marketplace in its current form have been identified in a <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-way-forward-1fa903fff430\"><strong>previous blog post</strong></a>.</p><ul><li><strong>Missing features</strong></li><li><strong>Required improvements on some features/functions</strong></li><li><strong>Required improvements on the marketplace’s performance and stability</strong></li><li><strong>Required improvements to the user interface (UI) and experience (UX)</strong></li></ul><p>The good news is…the marketplace’s adoption is not on the slow-side of things because it doesn’t provide any benefit over traditional online marketplaces, <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02#767d\"><strong>quite to the contrary</strong></a>. No, it’s rather simply because Particl isn’t “adoption-ready” yet.</p><p>That’s precisely with “<strong>making Particl adoption-ready</strong>” in mind that the Particl team is proud to release, today, its new development roadmap for 2020 and beyond!

Just keep reading and that’ll be no mystery to you by the end of this article!</p><hr><h2 id=\"the-new-roadmap-is-here-\">The New Roadmap is Here!</h2><p>Particl’s new roadmap is designed with one goal in mind: eliminate the barriers to entry and make Particl’s Open Marketplace “adoption-ready”. In other words, <strong>each roadmap item is there for a very specific reason, which is explained in detail in the Why? section </strong>of<strong> </strong>the roadmap.</p><p>To better plan ahead, <strong>it has also been separated into three different categories, each representing a different “phase” of adoption: Core Features, Innovators and Early Adopters</strong>. Each phase targets different types of users and has its own development requirements. To understand the categorization of items, it is important to first understand the “product adoption curve”. It represents, by user volume, the adoption curve of product throughout its lifespan.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/New-Development-Roadmap-Released-/1-uesNdJ26A9l2Ee2aPJ8duA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>The more roadmap items within a certain “phase category” are completed, the more likely it is that its targeted users will start using the marketplace. It also makes the onboarding process increasingly easier.</p><p><strong>Before getting down to the roadmap itself, let’s highlight a few important points:</strong></p><ul><li>The roadmap is not binding, meaning that items could be added, taken out, or see their scope change at any time.</li><li>There is no timeline associated with the roadmap. It shows what the team plans on working on in 2020 and beyond, but no deadline or ETA is provided, at least for the moment.</li><li>The items, although separated in adoption phases, are not ordered in any particular way. That means items near the top of the roadmap won’t necessarily be delivered before items near the end of it.</li><li>The roadmap doesn’t include ALL of the items that have been discussed by the Particl team due to the fact that some of them are more minor in scope. These will be integrated on Particl Desktop from time to time in various releases.</li><li>While not specifically mentioned in the roadmap, general performance and UI/UX improvements are expected to be included with most releases. This is an ongoing process that will go on all throughout Beta and even after it.</li></ul><p><strong>Without further ado, let’s jump right into the new development roadmap for 2020 and beyond!</strong></p><hr><h2 id=\"core-marketplace-layer-key-features\">Core Marketplace Layer / Key Features</h2><p>This stage of adoption has been limited mostly to the core Particl community due to the product itself (the marketplace) being so early in development and available features. It’s been a phase where the marketplace became reality, but still lacked a lot of very basic features and required improvements to attract new users. At that stage, the entire project is <strong>still considered experimental and probably even closer to an Alpha software rather than a Beta.</strong> Even though the marketplace is live on mainnet, it is still very much a testing phase (<strong>and thanks to YOU for being part of this very early but immensely important phase ?</strong> ).</p><p>More information about this phase can be found in previous articles that have recently been posted on Particl.news (<a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819\"><strong>1</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02\"><strong>2</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-way-forward-1fa903fff430\"><strong>3</strong></a>).</p><p>The key features here are the ability to create and join an infinite number of markets, the customization of your identities on those markets, and do all of that for next to no fee.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/New-Development-Roadmap-Released-/1-G3wprVFhOP5UnX4RmcpZYQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><hr><h2 id=\"innovators-stage-of-adoption\">Innovators Stage of Adoption</h2><p>If you’re reading this, you’re part of the innovators. This adoption stage is when it starts getting interesting and when we see the first few blips of organic adoption. It is at this moment that new features and improvements will slowly start making the marketplace “adoption-ready” for the innovator type of people.</p><p>“Innovators” are people that want to keep up with cutting edge technology and have generally strong aptitudes for technical processes. They are passionate about new technology and want to be the first to try it. At this stage, users that start using Particl are still considered “pioneers” as they are willing to ignore some missing elements, contribute towards improving the project (i.e. giving valuable feedback), and deal with more complicated flows that they know will improve over time, but they are also the people that will kickstart Particl’s “closed-loop” economy by making real online commerce.</p><p>In the specific case of Particl’s Open Marketplace, this stage of adoption is likely to attract cryptocurrency enthusiasts, privacy advocates, and participants of various niche industries in need of what Particl offers (because they can’t find it elsewhere).</p><p>This phase is PACKED with deliverables, but here are some particularly interesting ones:</p><ul><li>The <strong>fine-tuning of the Escrow</strong> (rate, optionality, …)</li><li>The possibility to run <strong>decentralized private auctions</strong></li><li>A <strong>messaging system</strong> between buyers and sellers</li><li>The <strong>development SDK </strong>(for developers)</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/New-Development-Roadmap-Released-/1-wA-g5N96NVKj6gbEZ-DjYw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><hr><h2 id=\"early-adopters-phase-of-adoption\">Early Adopters Phase of Adoption</h2><p>After the innovators come the early adopters. As its name implies, early adopters are still early into the game but their numbers are considerably higher than innovators.</p><p>Instead of coming around due to the novelty of a platform or because they have a very urgent need for it, they start using the platform because they see it as providing them with a dramatic strategic advantage not possible to have on other platforms and not yet leveraged by their competitors. These people have all sorts of strategic applications and are creative in how they will use new technologies to their end. They’re also somewhat tolerant ofrisks as they know the rewards can potentially be a game-changer for them. Whereas innovators tend to be fine rushing in, testing out the platform, and help find its pain points, early adopters expect a much more “adoption-ready” platform with as little problems as possible (although they do expect the platform to not be 100% ready).</p><p>In the specific case of Particl, this stage will likely attract the more aggressive and opportunistic types of sellers and enterprises.

✅\nOver the last few days, we’ve reviewed Particl’s past development\naccomplishments with a full 2019 development review\n[https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819] as well as a \nsummary of all the progress made on the Open Marketplace since its mainnet\nrelease\n[https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02].\n\nAs is pretty evident, the development of Particl’s Open Marketplace has been\npretty strong and consistent throughout 2019, but that’s really been the\nproject’s greatest strength ever since its launch in mid-2017.\n\nParticl’s 2019 Year in Review\n[https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819]\nThe Year the Dream Came Trueparticl.news\n[https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819]\n\nHowever, there’s one very important fact to consider — great development only\ntakes you so far. This isn’t early crypto anymore when innovative projects were\nrewarded with exposure and growth simply based on development accomplishments.\nIn reality, what the blockchain community is still looking for, even after all\nthese years, is the metaphorical “killer app”, that first blockchain product\nthat will significantly improve on something concrete and bring the masses on\nboard. In other words, it is looking for blockchain to cause a paradigm shift.\n\nIn fact, the crypto community has more or less “seen it all”, especially\nconsidering the large number of projects that have fundraised millions of\ndollars based on bold promises but haven’t delivered a single thing yet. And\neven those projects that have delivered live blockchain products have seen very\nlittle adoption from anyone outside the few crypto hobbyists. The reason for\nthat is actually pretty simple — crypto’s “killer app” is still missing and\nnowhere to be found.\n\n“Isn’t Particl THE Killer App”?\nWith that in mind, many within Particl’s community would be fast to point out\nthat Particl’s Open Marketplace is just that — crypto’s killer app. After all,\nit offers a LOT of benefits that simply cannot, by design, be offered by the\nmore traditional online marketplaces currently in existence…and that’s all\nthanks to blockchain and distributed technologies. It charges no commission and \nbarely any fee at all, is inherently private by default, provably secures your\ndata by completely getting rid of third-parties, requires no sign-up, no login, \nno personal or business information, is censorship-proof, free to use, and works\nfrom anywhere in the world as long as you can connect to the internet. In fewer\nwords, it completely redefines the very nature of eCommerce by taking it through\nthe evolutionary path and making it much better. And that simply wouldn’t be\npossible without blockchain and the other novel distributed technologies\nemployed by the Particl platform.\n\nSo why isn’t Particl getting more adoption? Why isn’t Particl the new hot\nmarketplace on the web? To understand why that is, it is important to look at it\nfrom a different perspective, one that’s not coming from a hardcore\ncryptocurrency enthusiast.\n\nThis is precisely what this article is going to breakdown. What are the\nmarketplace’s current pain points? What are some of its obstacles to adoption\nstill standing to this day? How can these be fixed or eliminated so that any\neffort towards user adoption starts yielding positive results? Get prepared,\nbecause this is the last blog post before Particl’s reveal of the new\ndevelopment roadmap. This article is intended to give the precise reasoning\nbehind the roadmap’s visions and will explain the team’s strategy moving\nforward, WITH adoption in mind. Now let’s get to it!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s the Marketplace’s Current Stage of Development?\nWarning Banner Header on Particl DesktopBefore getting into the finer details,\nwe first need to understand a very important fact — Particl’s Open Marketplace\nis still in its Beta phase, meaning it is still early software that’s in its\ntesting/development phase. It is not a final product, far from that, and that’s\ntrue even though it is currently running on mainnet.\n\nWhile Particl Desktop is certainly one of the most appealing crypto wallets out\nthere, and while the Open Marketplace itself is pretty impressive for a live\nblockchain product, it is still missing key features intended for its final\nversion. It is also relatively complex to use for most people (in this case,\nthink in terms of “non-crypto users”), both of which make adoption a real\nchallenge.\n\nThat, alone, explains the marketplace’s relatively low level of adoption\ncompared to traditional online marketplaces. Particl’s current users can still\ndefinitely be considered as pioneers, and perhaps still at this point, testers.\nOnly once Particl gets “adoption-ready” will it start seeing any significant\nincrease in the levels of adoption.\n\nBut the same key question remains — how do we make that marketplace\nadoption-ready? The answer is more obvious than it may seem — you just gotta fix\nwhat makes people NOT want to use it, and then, once that’s done, you can start\nreaching out to people and actually expect a decent “lead conversion rate”, aka\nthe number of people you reach out to that convert into marketplace users.\n\nWhat are the Marketplace’s Current Pain Points?\nThe first step to increase the marketplace’s adoption is to first understand\nwhat’s preventing it from getting said adoption. What could be better? What’s\nmissing? To that end, the Particl team has recently received a feedback report\nfrom a very prominent crypto company\n[https://particl.news/bounding-forward-quality-feedback-from-a-private-peer-review-51e2e9c72fb7] \nwhich ended up being directly in line with what had been observed by the Particl\nteam itself.\n\nAs it currently stands, the reasons can mostly be separated into 4 different\ncategories:\n\n * Missing features\n\nBecause Particl is not a final product yet and still in Beta, it is in no way \nfeature complete [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_complete]. That means a\nlot of features simply aren’t ready or even started yet. These features could be\ntools that make sellers’ life easier, indicators that help buyers make\nbetter-informed purchasing decisions, etc.\n\nAnd while the release of Market Management will mark the end of an important\ndevelopment phase for the marketplace, one that was mostly focused on developing\nthe base layer of what the marketplace was always intended to be when Particl\nwas first launched, the next phase that will then begin will also have its load\nof very important features, although they might not impact the overall structure\nof the marketplace the same way Market Management will.\n\nAnd even then, once Market Management and other features will release, they\nprobably will have to be improved further moving ahead in time. Which brings us\nto the second category…\n\n * Required improvements on some features/functions\n\nReleasing a feature is something. Making sure it’s as efficient and smooth as it\nneeds to be is another. That much is made pretty evident with the major\nrefactoring of the marketplace that is currently underway and will hit mainnet\non the same release as the Market Management. Indeed, it is expected to\nsignificantly improve the marketplace’s performance, make it much lighter, and\nwill also noticeably change the look and feel of it. Not surprising when you\nlearn the update introducing Market Management touches around 80% or more of\nParticl’s marketplace components…\n\nAs time goes by, developers figure out more efficient ways to implement features\nand functions. The process of making those changes, after a feature is released,\nis called “refactoring [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring]”. Code\nrefactoring is also important when introducing new, major features that touch\ncomponents also touched by other previously released features. That’s to make\nsure the code’s health remains good and that the network doesn’t end up being a\nbig pile of spaghetti code [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code].\n\nBut more specifically in the context of user adoption, features that are already\nout or about to be released may need improvements moving forward before they\nbecome user-friendly. Additionally, features may be released in many different\nphases, first bringing the base layer for it, and then improving on it by adding\nmore functionalities and efficiency in following updates.\n\n * Required improvements on the marketplace’s performance and stability\n\nSometimes, the required improvements can be harder to pinpoint because they are\nnot directly related to specific features or functions. That’s because it may be\nthe whole back-end that requires some refactoring and improvements. While these\nchanges are more difficult to track and, at times, to even feel their impact, it\ndefinitely shows over multiple releases, each containing its own set of general\nimprovements.\n\nThose improvements are what make the marketplace generally faster. They are what\nmakes listings sync up more quickly, what makes listing fees smaller, what makes\nloading times shorter, etc.\n\nIt’s easy to overlook this particular category. After all, it’s a normal reflex\nto be thinking that once all the key features are in place, the product is ready\nto market. But there is much more than that, and each feature needs to be\nappropriately integrated and feel right before it can be considered as ready.\n\nConsidering that today’s traditional online marketplaces are built on the web,\nand also because most people access those with pretty decent internet\nconnections, speed and “hassle-free” user experience is expected from both\nsellers and buyers now more than ever. Even more so, users will generally be\nwilling to spend a little more if it means simpler and more pleasant user\nexperience. Which leads us to the fourth and final category…\n\n * Required improvements to the user interface (UI) and experience (UX)\n\n“UI/UX is everything”, or so… Referring to the previous statement, “users will\ngenerally be willing to spend a little more if it means a simpler and more\npleasant user experience”.\n\nOf course, UI/UX is not the only thing that matters, but it is what glues\neverything together so that it makes sense and just feels right. You can have\nall the features in the world, but if they are displayed confusingly or\nunpleasantly, people will generally not even bother. That becomes even truer as\na product’s learning curve gets steeper.\n\nThe reason behind this is mostly due to time constraints and the over-saturation\nof options available to users. Especially in the case of marketplaces — there\nare hundreds, if not thousands of them. Even if a marketplace’s value\nproposition is significant, it’s pretty hard to change people’s habits and get\nthem to move from a marketplace they know and feel comfortable using to one that\nis complicated to understand and doesn’t look as good (it’s pretty fair to\nsay…looks do matter).\n\nSo, is Particl’s Open Marketplace complicated to use? The answer might be “no”\nto you, but be assured it’s probably a resounding “YES” for most people you\nknow. So how do you make these people leap forward and into this new age for\nonline marketplaces? You gotta make sure that each of these 4 categories is\nbeing taken care of by the development team and bring the marketplace to a point\nthat it may finally be considered “adoption-ready”.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2020, Let’s Tackle Those Issues!\nNow that we know where lies the adoption hurdles for Particl’s Open Marketplace,\nit’s now time to strategize and plan around those. As such, the Particl team has\ncrafted a brand new development roadmap for 2020 and beyond. With adoption in\nmind, each of the roadmap items has been carefully selected to eliminate what\nwould make people not want to use the marketplace. There is one specific reason\nbehind each of these items.\n\nIt’s important to understand, though, that the 4 categories mentioned above are\ntightly intertwined. For example, you can’t spend too much time on UI/UX when\nthe marketplace may still significantly change structure as it will with the\nintegration of Market Management. But you should still do a little, as long as\nyou keep development hours wastes at a minimum. This is why Particl’s\ndevelopment team is focusing on these 4 categories as the underlying line of\nthinking behind the new roadmap’s content.\n\nThe Time to Reveal the New Roadmap is NOW ?\nYes indeed, the time to reveal the new roadmap has arrived! We now know just \nhow\nmuch has been done in 2019\n[https://particl.news/particls-2019-year-in-review-e456b0a19819], how far has\nthe marketplace has progressed since releasing on mainnet\n[https://particl.news/particls-open-marketplace-progress-so-far-cfaa29d1de02],\nand what are the reasons it’s not been getting more adoption up until now. We\nare now equipped with all the tools to fully understand the reasoning behind the\nitems included in the new roadmap.\n\nWith that being said, you can safely expect the new roadmap to be revealed next\nweek, with its full and detailed breakdown being published on Particl.news\n[http://Particl.news].\n\nAs Market Management comes out in the next few weeks and with the new roadmap\ngiving a clear indication of the way forward for the project, the entire Particl\nteam is more than excited for what lies ahead of us all.

What are the marketplace’s current pain points? What are some of its obstacles to adoption still standing to this day? How can these be fixed or eliminated so that any effort towards user adoption starts yielding positive results? Get prepared, because <strong>this is the last blog post before Particl’s reveal of the new development roadmap</strong>. This article is intended to give the precise reasoning behind the roadmap’s visions and will explain the team’s strategy moving forward, WITH adoption in mind. Now let’s get to it!</p><hr><h2 id=\"what-s-the-marketplace-s-current-stage-of-development\">What’s the Marketplace’s Current Stage of Development?</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/The-Way-Forward/1-1pWgQdPqD1Tgk3FBk2oKQw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Warning Banner Header on Particl Desktop</figcaption></figure><p>Before getting into the finer details, we first need to understand a very important fact — Particl’s Open Marketplace is still in its Beta phase, meaning it is still early software that’s in its testing/development phase. It is not a final product, far from that, and that’s true even though it is currently running on mainnet.</p><p>While Particl Desktop is certainly one of the most appealing crypto wallets out there, and while the Open Marketplace itself is pretty impressive for a live blockchain product, it is still missing key features intended for its final version. It is also relatively complex to use for most people (in this case, think in terms of “non-crypto users”), both of which make adoption a real challenge.</p><p>That, alone, explains the marketplace’s relatively low level of adoption compared to traditional online marketplaces. Particl’s current users can still definitely be considered as pioneers, and perhaps still at this point, testers. Only once Particl gets “adoption-ready” will it start seeing any significant increase in the levels of adoption.</p><p>But the same key question remains — how do we make that marketplace adoption-ready? The answer is more obvious than it may seem — you just gotta fix what makes people NOT want to use it, and then, once that’s done, you can start reaching out to people and actually expect a decent “lead conversion rate”, aka the number of people you reach out to that convert into marketplace users.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-marketplace-s-current-pain-points\">What are the Marketplace’s Current Pain Points?</h2><p>The first step to increase the marketplace’s adoption is to first understand what’s preventing it from getting said adoption. What could be better? What’s missing? To that end, <a href=\"https://particl.news/bounding-forward-quality-feedback-from-a-private-peer-review-51e2e9c72fb7\"><strong>the Particl team has recently received a feedback report from a very prominent crypto company</strong></a> which ended up being directly in line with what had been observed by the Particl team itself.</p><p>As it currently stands, the reasons can mostly be separated into 4 different categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Missing features</strong></li></ul><p>Because Particl is not a final product yet and still in Beta, it is in no way <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_complete\"><strong>feature complete</strong></a>. That means a lot of features simply aren’t ready or even started yet. These features could be tools that make sellers’ life easier, indicators that help buyers make better-informed purchasing decisions, etc.</p><p>And while the release of Market Management will mark the end of an important development phase for the marketplace, one that was mostly focused on developing the base layer of what the marketplace was always intended to be when Particl was first launched, the next phase that will then begin will also have its load of very important features, although they might not impact the overall structure of the marketplace the same way Market Management will.</p><p>And even then, once Market Management and other features will release, they probably will have to be improved further moving ahead in time. Which brings us to the second category…</p><ul><li><strong>Required improvements on some features/functions</strong></li></ul><p>Releasing a feature is something. Making sure it’s as efficient and smooth as it needs to be is another. That much is made pretty evident with the major refactoring of the marketplace that is currently underway and will hit mainnet on the same release as the Market Management. Indeed, it is expected to significantly improve the marketplace’s performance, make it much lighter, and will also noticeably change the look and feel of it. Not surprising when you learn the update introducing Market Management touches around 80% or more of Particl’s marketplace components…</p><p>As time goes by, developers figure out more efficient ways to implement features and functions. The process of making those changes, after a feature is released, is called “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring\"><strong>refactoring</strong></a>”. Code refactoring is also important when introducing new, major features that touch components also touched by other previously released features. That’s to make sure the code’s health remains good and that the network doesn’t end up being a big pile of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code\"><strong>spaghetti code</strong></a>.</p><p>But more specifically in the context of user adoption, features that are already out or about to be released may need improvements moving forward before they become user-friendly. Additionally, features may be released in many different phases, first bringing the base layer for it, and then improving on it by adding more functionalities and efficiency in following updates.</p><ul><li><strong>Required improvements on the marketplace’s performance and stability</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, the required improvements can be harder to pinpoint because they are not directly related to specific features or functions. That’s because it may be the whole back-end that requires some refactoring and improvements. While these changes are more difficult to track and, at times, to even feel their impact, it definitely shows over multiple releases, each containing its own set of general improvements.</p><p>Those improvements are what make the marketplace generally faster. They are what makes listings sync up more quickly, what makes listing fees smaller, what makes loading times shorter, etc.</p><p>It’s easy to overlook this particular category. After all, it’s a normal reflex to be thinking that once all the key features are in place, the product is ready to market. But there is much more than that, and each feature needs to be appropriately integrated and <em>feel right</em> before it can be considered as ready.</p><p>Considering that today’s traditional online marketplaces are built on the web, and also because most people access those with pretty decent internet connections, speed and “hassle-free” user experience is expected from both sellers and buyers now more than ever.
