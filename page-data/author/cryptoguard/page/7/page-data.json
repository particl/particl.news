We'll delve into\nthis topic later on.\n\nAbout the Event \nFrom the beginning, Monerotopia aimed to be different from large corporate\ncryptocurrency events such as Consensus or Bitcoin Miami. Indeed, the focus was\non quality over quantity, yet the event still attracted a respectable number of\nattendees. \n\nThis was partly due to Monerotopia's decision to establish a market of craftsmen\nin the event's center, many of whom later became Monero sellers, but really, the\nsheer number of quality projects either presenting or attending was enough to\ndraw in a very focused crowd.\n\nThe venue was divided into distinct areas such as the market, main stage (where\nDr. Kap spoke), remote stage, privacy tech loft, and a workshop zone. Traffic\nremained consistently high across all areas, reflecting the good choice of\nlocation for that particular event.\n\nGoals at Monerotopia \nWith a privacy and liberty-centric theme and an impressive lineup of projects,\nincluding Monero-based Cake Wallet, Monerujo, and SeraiDEX, but also other\nprivacy projects such as Firo, Nym, Oxen/Session, Zano, only to name a few, our\ngoal was to establish valuable connections with other projects and key\nindividuals. Unfortunately, DarkFi was unable to attend, but we hope to catch up\nwith them at Monerokon next month. \n\nOur mission was to create connections, make new friends, and explore\ncollaborative potential with other projects and individuals, and to that we can\nsay that it was a definitive success. We eagerly anticipate the many\nopportunities and future collaborations resulting from these discussions, as\nthey will be a major contributor to make preserving privacy and freedom easier\nthan ever before.\n\nDr Kap’s Presentation \nOn the event's final day, we were honored to give a 40-minute presentation to a\nfull room of privacy enthusiasts. The response to our message was incredibly\npositive, and it visibly resonated with the audience a lot.\n\n> Dr Kap @thegreatestdoc [https://twitter.com/thegreatestdoc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] \npresenting BasicSwap an atomic swap DEX in beta (with $FIRO\n[https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FIRO&src=ctag&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] support) and\npromoting a more inclusive privacy coin ecosystem. pic.twitter.com/Q4TYGZD9TS\n[https://t.co/Q4TYGZD9TS]\n\n— Firo $FIRO (@firoorg) May 7, 2023\n[https://twitter.com/firoorg/status/1655312001956999169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]\nThe speech was attended by various individuals and projects we had networked\nwith throughout the event, as well as some Particl community members who\ntraveled to Mexico to meet us and a whole slew of new faces. With multiple\nrounds of applause and high enthusiasm, the speech was, in our view, a\nresounding success.\n\nWhile it was broadcast live for virtual ticket holders, it will be publicly\npublished online by the Monerotopia crew very soon.\n\nParticl Booth at the Privacy Loft\nAlthough the event prioritized quality over quantity, our booth consistently\nattracted attendees and saw a considerable boost in activity after Dr Kap's\npresentation. \n\nThe smaller crowd allowed for longer, more meaningful conversations with people\ngenuinely interested in the topics of privacy and freedom, and it helped in\nbuilding more solid relationships with awesome people. This also enabled us to\nexplore the venue and support our new friends by attending to their speeches.\n\nNew Friends \nWe are thrilled to have established new friendships and strengthened existing\nones with various projects and individuals. These connections will undoubtedly\nbenefit the advancement of privacy technology as a whole.\n\nAs everyone begins returning home or settling in, we look forward to continuing\nthe many ongoing discussions about collaborations, partnerships, and\nintegrations with them. We are thrilled to support them in their groundbreaking\nwork and look forward to helping each other in solidarity.\n\nAs Dr Kap's speech demonstrated, Particl and BasicSwap aim to create a coherent\nlayer that unites privacy projects by building not only technology but also\ngenuine, lasting relationships. Monerotopia was a stepping stone for the project\nin that sense.\n\nMoving Forward \nWith the overwhelmingly positive reaction received at the event, we are, now\nmore than ever, eager to participate in more events and gatherings.\n\nIn fact, Particl has been invited to present at Monerokon 2023 next month. This\ntechnical presentation will focus on BasicSwap's relationship with Monero, and\nmany of the people we met this weekend will be in attendance or presenting as\nwell.\n\nIf you are aware of privacy and liberty-focused events, please send the\ninformation our way. We would love to get out there and meet you if it's close\nto your location!\n\nAnd now, hard work continues and let's keep pushing the boundaries by making\nprivacy and pro-liberty tech more accessible and inter-connected than before!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

that has been made in\nthe past few days.

that has been made in\nthe past few days. Let us take a moment to evaluate the advancements achieved in\nthe past few days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nWe can now report that the majority of bugs identified with the release of\nParticl Desktop 3.3 are now resolved and ready to push. We are currently\nwrapping a few remaining issues, notably the one related to the malfunctioning\nof the marketplace. \n\nIf you are having difficulty with the marketplace, specifically with orders that\nare not being accepted by the seller or with the other party you're transacting\nwith not progressing through the escrow steps, it is likely to be related to the\nissue we are currently addressing. \n\nWe expect to be done with these fixes shortly, after which we'll immediately\npush Particl Desktop 3.3.1 live. Once that happens, we will resume work on the\nupcoming seller app.\n\nAdditionally, we have been striving to increase the efficacy of the desktop\nclient when running within test environments and on testnet/regtest. This is\nprimarily to facilitate debugging and is mostly intended for internal use and\ntroubleshooting.\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nMost of the progress made in regards to BasicSwap these past few days have been\non the GUI side of things. We are still wrapping up the last components and\nissues of the GUI and will be ready to release it ASAP. \n\nMarket Making Script ?\nWe have initiated a broader community testing of a few of the market making\nscript functions. Specifically, we have distributed, in the BasicSwap testing\ngroup, a template configuration file to be used in conjunction with the script\nand are observing the testing results.\n\nIt should be noted that the present testing is focused solely on the automated\nreposting of offers to the order book in addition to the automatic updating of\npricing information.\n\nWe will roll out testing for additional features shortly, and the initial\nversion of the script will be made available to the public upon completion of\nthe necessary tests.\n\nIf you would like to assist in testing the script, please send us a message and\nwe will add you to the Element testing room with the corresponding instructions.\n\nSMSG 2.0 vs Web Framework ⚖️\nThis week, we've initited a more in-depth R&D phase for SMSG 2.0; assembling\ntogether the various concepts that will go into it. \n\nWe have also been assessing the viability of leveraging other existing mixnets\nto scale up Particl dApps (BasicSwap and Particl Marketplace) in the short-term\nwith the intention of shifting the primary focus from building SMSG 2.0 to\ndeveloping the web platform. Indeed, being able to leverage existing protocols\nis a key part of our new modular and open vision. \n\nThis approach could expedite the web deployment process of Particl dApps, thus\naddressing some of their critical barriers to adoption more promptly.\nUltimately, this would facilitate Particl dApps to access a broader audience\nmore quickly, thus accelerating the rate at which they can gain increased\nadoption.\n\nIt is important to recall that scaling up both BSX and Particl Marketplace is a\nnecessary step before deploying them on the web. Integrating an existing mixnet\nrather than building a new one from scratch may assist us in expediting the\nprocess, thus allowing for the deployment of user-friendly web dApps in a more\ncompressed timeline.\n\nOf course, a variety of factors must be taken into consideration when\ndetermining if this approach is the most viable, such as whether any existing\nmixnets are capable of meeting all of our dApps' needs.

BasicSwap DEX, and rightly so.\n\nIt is important to remember, however, that BSX was not developed in a vacuum,\nbut rather as an integral part of a much wider picture: a decentralized,\nconfidential and pro-liberty economic system, which runs parallel to the world\neconomy.\n\nThat is, after all, why the DEX and the Particl Marketplace dApp are being built\nin tandem: because they are each critical components towards that higher goal.\n\nTo that end, and now that Particl Desktop 3.3 is on mainnet, the new\ndevelopment\ncycle [https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/] for\nParticl can finally begin, bringing us back to a more balanced development focus\nbetween BasicSwap and other aspects of the Particl ecosystem. Notably, this new\ncycle will bring forth groundbreaking advancements to the Particl Marketplace,\nmaking it more attainable and user-friendly than ever before.\n\nParticl’s Next Evolutionary Leap ForwardLearn about the team’s new major\ndevelopment cycle and discover Particl’s upcoming open-source foundation for\nthe\ndevelopment and deployment of privacy-first dApps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/]This blog post\nwill provide an overview of the Marketplace's short-to-medium-term roadmap, as\nwell as a clear breakdown of the early development plans that will shape Particl\ninto an open, connected, and modular ecosystem.\n\nAfter reading, you will have a clear understanding of the progress and\nmilestones that Particl will reach in 2023 and beyond — be sure to give it your\nfull attention!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTables of Contents\n * A New Journey Begins\n * New DeCommerce Apps Coming Up\n * Seller App Explained\n * Buyer App Explained\n * Liquidity Solutions\n * The Evolution of DeCommerce\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA New Journey Begins\nParticl Desktop 3.3 has recently been released on mainnet, and with it\nofficially begins the new development cycle that will transform Particl into a\nmodular, open, and highly efficient ecosystem for privacy-first and pro-liberty\ndApps.\n\nWhile Particl Desktop 3.3 made early strides towards that vision by decoupling\nParticl Core from the desktop client, the vision for Particl’s improved\narchitecture goes way beyond the confines of Particl Desktop.\n\nIndeed, one of the most prominent benefits of this new phase will be the\nintroduction of massive improvements to the functionality and accessibility of\nthe Particl Marketplace, a dApp that we believe is essential to our mission to\ncreate a parallel, independent economy.\n\nMajor Marketplace dApp Improvements Underway\nIn its current form, the Particl Marketplace is more a set of Particl Desktop\nfeatures than a standalone entity. This poses certain limitations that can only\nbe rectified by turning it into a proper standalone, flexible, and\nhyper-connected client.\n\nSince the Marketplace’s debut and over the course of its various iterations,\nwe've gathered feedback from our user base, including buyers and sellers who\nhave utilized the dApp extensively. By doing so, we have been able to compile a\nconcise list of essential enhancements that must be implemented in order to\nensure the marketplace achieves widespread adoption.\n\nConsequently, the improvements we are introducing to the marketplace dApp, and\nto the ecosystem as a whole, seek to increase its adoption potential by actively\naddressing its primary shortcomings.\n\nThe following items represent the aspects of the Particl Marketplace dApp we\nwant to improve in the months to come.\n\nSimplicity and User Experience\nAs it stands, Particl Marketplace is not optimized to support widespread\nadoption: its complex and time-consuming setup process, its reliance on a\ndesktop application, and its intricate user flow all render it unsuitable to the\naverage user. This is particularly true for less tech-savvy users, or users\ncoming from outside of cryptocurrency-focused communities.\n\nFurthermore, it can be said that the desktop interface, which was created for\nboth sellers and customers, increases the complexity of the platform compared to\nconventional e-commerce sites, which typically provide specific portals for the\ntwo types of users.\n\nAccessibility\nThe currently limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace is also an\nimportant hindrance to adoption and growth; as of now, in order to use the\nmarketplace, users must first download, install, and sync the Particl Desktop\napplication.\n\nRight from the onset, it is a tough sell to persuade online sellers and buyers\nto download a program for their eCommerce needs when there are numerous\nweb-based marketplaces available. What’s more, the need to first create a\nwallet, wait for a complete blockchain and then a secondary P2P network to sync\nin full is an additional, cumulative deterrent to even give the Marketplace a\ntry in the first place.\n\nIt’s not difficult to see how the absence of a web gateway and third-party\nintegration within the Particl Marketplace has hindered its adoption progress,\nespecially as we see the wider blockchain industry moving towards a more\nweb-based approach (i.e., Defi). Addressing that shortcoming is a key element of\nthe current Particl Marketplace development roadmap.\n\nLiquidity and Agnosticism\nA further impediment to the wider adoption of the Particl Marketplace is the\nlimited liquidity of the PART coin, as well as the lack of support for other\ndigital currencies.\n\nOn one hand, by introducing the ability to accept multiple currencies on the\nmarketplace (while still maintaining PART as the privacy-preserving settlement\nlayer), the dApp could rapidly expand its user base and broaden its use cases.\n\nHowever, as PART is vital to this process, there must be sufficient liquidity\nfor other currencies to exchange in and out of PART, and do so rapidly, without\ncausing significant slippage.\n\nFurthermore, sellers who wish to carry out transactions exclusively with PART\nmust still find a way to convert a portion of their sales revenue to cover\noperational costs, inventory, and other associated expenses. This is currently a\nchallenge due to the limited liquidity, which also leads to slippage and\nfinancial unpredictability.\n\nThe integration of BasicSwap-powered services into the marketplace and the\nforthcoming seller app holds considerable importance for both liquidity and the\ninclusion of new coins into the Particl economy. Other solutions are also\nactively being considered to further bolster liquidity for merchants.\n\nScalability\nFinally, although not an immediate concern, it is our intention to improve the\nmarketplace’s scalability. This is due to the fact that the SMSG network, which\nserves as the foundation of a significant portion of the Marketplace dApp, is\nalso a main component of the BasicSwap DEX.\n\nConsequently, should either of these two dApp's achieve considerable usage and\ngenerate large amounts of activity on the SMSG network, it could negatively\naffect the performance of other SMSG-dependent dApps.\n\nIn light of this, we have decided to begin work on a new version of SMSG,\ntentatively named SMSG 2.0. This new version will facilitate message\ndistribution, allowing for a much more scalable ecosystem where high usage of\nindividual dApps will not affect the performance of other dApps also utilizing\nthe SMSG 2.0 network.\n\nNew DeCommerce Apps Coming Up\nIt can be said that the liquidity, agnosticism, and scalability of the ecosystem\nare reliant in parts on some of its other components (i.e., BasicSwap and SMSG\n2.0); however, the user experience, simplicity, and accessibility can be\ndirectly enhanced by optimizing the marketplace dApp itself, as well as its\ngateways.\n\nAs such, our strategy for the near and intermediate future regarding the Particl\nMarketplace is to introduce two separate applications: a seller app (seller\ndashboard) and a buyer-oriented web/mobile gateway.\n\nLet’s explore each of these applications in more detail, and examine how they\nwill work synergistically to significantly improve the Particl Marketplace.\n\nSeller Dashboard (Standalone App)\nThe first application scheduled for release is a standalone seller dashboard to\nassist vendors on Particl Marketplace to manage their listings and activities.\nThe dashboard is composed of three distinct sections:\n\nRemote Services Management: This suite of capabilities provides the means to\nmanage connections to external services, such as WooCommerce and other eCommerce\nplatforms (Shopify, Medusa, etc), inventory management systems, liquidity\nproviders, and more.\n\nThe Particl Seller App is designed to integrate external services, granting\nsellers access to an ever-expanding range of eCommerce technologies, platforms,\nand plugins, and allowing them to leverage their various benefits directly on\nParticl Marketplace.\n\nInventory and Listing Management: This category deals with anything inventory\nand listing related. This includes management of listing data, prices, and\npublishing methodology, among other functions.\n\nNotably, the app will enable sellers to automatically republish listings on\nParticl Marketplace after expiration and to adjust PART prices in accordance\nwith current coin value via the optional utilization of APIs. This will\nsignificantly improve the seller experience and minimize the time needed to\nmanage and maintain Particl listings, which has been a widely requested\nimprovement from Particl Marketplace sellers.\n\nMarketplace Activities: This category encompasses all activities related to the\nmarketplace, including order management, customer communication, escrow\nprogression, and more.\n\nIn the end, sellers will be able to carry out all their tasks and activities\nexclusively from the seller app, without the need for Particl Desktop.\n\nTypical Flow\nIn order to understand the full potential of what this application enables, let\nus examine a hypothetical example of how it might be used by a fictitious\nseller.\n\nAlice, a dropshipper, has an eCommerce store powered by WooCommerce and is\nlooking to expand her reach by utilizing the Particl Marketplace. She downloads\nthe seller application and, with the help of the remote service manager, is able\nto seamlessly connect her WooCommerce store and import her full inventory with\nthe press of a button. Additionally, due to a specific WooCommerce plugin she\nuses which dynamically updates her item prices based on supplier data, she opts\nto have her inventory on the seller app stay in sync with any changes made on\nWooCommerce.\n\nHaving imported her inventory, she now configures her Particl Marketplace\naccount preferences. She opts to peg her listing prices to a fixed US dollar\nvaluation, pushing the price update once daily and ensuring that her items stay\nlisted on the marketplace consistently. As a renowned seller in her community\nwith recurring buyers, she also decides to set her escrow rate at 0%. And then,\nto lock in the value of her sales, she opts to automatically swap PART to USDT\nwhen a sale is finalized; she proceeds to the remote services manager and\nenables a liquidity plugin for that purpose. Finally, she enables a function to\nautomatically accept bids from certain countries to expedite the service she\nprovides to her customers.\n\nThen, as she receives orders, she can manage them all via the app, including\ndispatching tracking numbers, messages, and more, all without having to undergo\nParticl Desktop's extensive setup process.\n\nSubsequent Improvements\nThe example described above illustrates a few of the advantages sellers will\ngain in terms of user experience, convenience, and added capabilities via\nexternal integrations. But this proposed seller app is merely the first phase of\nwhat is ultimately envisioned.\n\nIn later stages, we intend to integrate its range of features into a\ncomprehensive web dashboard, enabling sellers to benefit from its features\nwithout requiring a software download.\n\nWe also plan on building a ready-made WooCommerce plugin that provides sellers\nwith the same features of the app, but fed directly into their WooCommerce\ndashboard. This includes the ability to receive, accept, and manage Particl\nMarketplace orders inside WooCommerce’s regular dashboard, in addition to\nsending and receiving messages and other supplementary features. When complete,\nthis will offer sellers the ability to list their inventory on Particl\nMarketplace with minimal disruption to their regular workflow, a considerable\nstep towards simplifying the acquisition of new sellers.\n\nThis is earmarked as a subsequent stage of the seller app, and requires further\nexploration. Nevertheless, this should give you a good understanding of the\npotential that Particl's open, modular, and highly-interconnected architecture\nprovides.\n\nUltimately, our goal is to incorporate a lot of these features into the desktop\nversion of Particl Marketplace — which will remain the best solution for those\nlooking for the maximum amount of decentralization and privacy — but first\ndeploying them within a standalone application is a quicker path towards\nproviding sellers with those much-needed improvements.\n\nMarketplace dApp Designed for Buyers\nEven with the wide range of features and enhancements to the seller experience,\nwe must not forget that Particl Marketplace is a two-way street. Without buyers,\nsellers cannot exist, and our plans for improvement would be incomplete without\nconsidering both sides of the equation.\n\nThat is why, subsequent to releasing the initial iterations of the seller app,\nthe next step will be to develop a mobile and/or web edition of the marketplace,\nfeaturing an entirely redesigned user experience tailored to buyers.\n\nThis will give online purchasers a more straightforward user experience, ridding\nthem of all superfluous vendor-related and technical features they don't need or\ncare about, and making Particl Marketplace more akin to what one would generally\nexpect from an online marketplace, while still benefiting from the advantages\nassociated with its decentralized and privacy-first nature.\n\nAlthough the exact features and functions of this app are yet to be determined,\nwe can confidently say that our goal is to provide a buyer experience that is as\nstreamlined and accessible as possible. To that end, we plan to focus on\nuser-friendliness and the intuitiveness of its user interface, wider\naccessibility through either web browsers or a mobile application (or both), and\nproviding a tailored experience that meets the specific needs of buyers.\n\nUpon completion of both the buyer and seller applications, Particl's DeCommerce\necosystem will be able to provide privacy, decentralization, and freedom, while\nminimizing the usual drawbacks associated with those terms. In essence, by\nsimplifying the use of Particl's DeCommerce products, the adoption potential of\nParticl Marketplace will inevitably be increased, bringing its benefits to as\nmany people as ever.\n\nLiquidity Solutions\nHaving great products is one thing — however, when it comes to Particl and\nDeCommerce, the liquidity of the underlying assets (in this case, PART pairs) is\nof equal importance.\n\nThis is why we are adding a remote services connector to the seller app, to work\nin tandem with BasicSwap DEX. With a modular and open approach to Particl, we\ncan integrate different liquidity services, such as instant-fill orders on BSX,\nas well as third-party liquidity services for the marketplace, to facilitate the\npurchasing and selling of PART for DeCommerce purposes.\n\nThe incorporation of these systems offers market makers the chance to benefit\nfrom the emergence of DeCommerce and generate income from Particl Marketplace\nsales, by providing the essential liquidity users will inevitably need to tap\ninto.\n\nAs we progress with the development of the aforementioned applications, we are\nalso researching various liquidity plugin concepts. We believe those will\nsignificantly enhance the user experience of the marketplace and enable Particl\nto be a successful, autonomous economy that keeps its no-compromise approach to\nprivacy and freedom.\n\nThe Evolution of DeCommerce\nWe hope that, by now, you have acquired an understanding of our\nshort-to-medium-term plans for the Particl Marketplace and the substantial\nadvantages of adapting Particl into a more open, connected, and modular system.\n\nAs we strive to enhance Particl Marketplace, please bear in mind that this is\nonly one element of our broader vision for Particl to become a privacy-first and\npro-liberty economy. We seek to build usable, accessible, and easy to use\napplications that bring the benefits of privacy and uncompromising\ndecentralization to as many people as possible, and we make important progress\ntowards that goal every day.\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nRemaining mindful of our open-source origins, we strongly urge you to stay\nup-to-date with the progress being made concerning the platform's modularity.\nThis will enable you to take advantage of a wealth of possibilities to create\nplugins, services, apps, and integrations that can optimize and expand the\noverall Particl ecosystem.\n\nAlso, if you’re not a developer and just have a great idea, you can also make a\nproposal to the community [https://ccs.particl.io/]! Who knows, maybe a great\nconcept that ends up revolutionizing the deCommerce game is really just one\nproposal away :^)\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

This poses certain limitations that can only be rectified by turning it into a proper standalone, flexible, and hyper-connected client.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/02/mp.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2023/02/mp.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2023/02/mp.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/02/mp.png 1397w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"></figure><p>Since the Marketplace’s debut and over the course of its various iterations, we've gathered feedback from our user base, including buyers and sellers who have utilized the dApp extensively. By doing so, we have been able to compile a concise list of essential enhancements that must be implemented in order to ensure the marketplace achieves widespread adoption.</p><p>Consequently, the improvements we are introducing to the marketplace dApp, and to the ecosystem as a whole, seek to increase its adoption potential by actively addressing its primary shortcomings.</p><p>The following items represent the aspects of the Particl Marketplace dApp we want to improve in the months to come.</p><h3 id=\"simplicity-and-user-experience\">Simplicity and User Experience</h3><p>As it stands, Particl Marketplace is not optimized to support widespread adoption: its complex and time-consuming setup process, its reliance on a desktop application, and its intricate user flow all render it unsuitable to the average user. This is particularly true for less tech-savvy users, or users coming from outside of cryptocurrency-focused communities.</p><p>Furthermore, it can be said that the desktop interface, which was created for both sellers and customers, increases the complexity of the platform compared to conventional e-commerce sites, which typically provide specific portals for the two types of users.</p><h3 id=\"accessibility\">Accessibility</h3><p>The currently limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace is also an important hindrance to adoption and growth; as of now, in order to use the marketplace, users must first download, install, and sync the Particl Desktop application.</p><p>Right from the onset, it is a tough sell to persuade online sellers and buyers to download a program for their eCommerce needs when there are numerous web-based marketplaces available. What’s more, the need to first create a wallet, wait for a complete blockchain and then a secondary P2P network to sync in full is an additional, cumulative deterrent to even give the Marketplace a try in the first place.</p><p>It’s not difficult to see how the absence of a web gateway and third-party integration within the Particl Marketplace has hindered its adoption progress, especially as we see the wider blockchain industry moving towards a more web-based approach (i.e., Defi). Addressing that shortcoming is a key element of the current Particl Marketplace development roadmap.</p><h3 id=\"liquidity-and-agnosticism\">Liquidity and Agnosticism</h3><p>A further impediment to the wider adoption of the Particl Marketplace is the limited liquidity of the PART coin, as well as the lack of support for other digital currencies.</p><p>On one hand, by introducing the ability to accept multiple currencies on the marketplace (while still maintaining PART as the privacy-preserving settlement layer), the dApp could rapidly expand its user base and broaden its use cases.</p><p>However, as PART is vital to this process, there must be sufficient liquidity for other currencies to exchange in and out of PART, and do so rapidly, without causing significant slippage.</p><p>Furthermore, sellers who wish to carry out transactions exclusively with PART must still find a way to convert a portion of their sales revenue to cover operational costs, inventory, and other associated expenses. This is currently a challenge due to the limited liquidity, which also leads to slippage and financial unpredictability.</p><p>The integration of BasicSwap-powered services into the marketplace and the forthcoming seller app holds considerable importance for both liquidity and the inclusion of new coins into the Particl economy. Other solutions are also actively being considered to further bolster liquidity for merchants.</p><h3 id=\"scalability\">Scalability</h3><p>Finally, although not an immediate concern, it is our intention to improve the marketplace’s scalability. This is due to the fact that the SMSG network, which serves as the foundation of a significant portion of the Marketplace dApp, is also a main component of the BasicSwap DEX.</p><p>Consequently, should either of these two dApp's achieve considerable usage and generate large amounts of activity on the SMSG network, it could negatively affect the performance of other SMSG-dependent dApps.</p><p>In light of this, we have decided to begin work on a new version of SMSG, tentatively named SMSG 2.0. This new version will facilitate message distribution, allowing for a much more scalable ecosystem where high usage of individual dApps will not affect the performance of other dApps also utilizing the SMSG 2.0 network.</p><h1 id=\"new-decommerce-apps-coming-up\">New DeCommerce Apps Coming Up</h1><p>It can be said that the liquidity, agnosticism, and scalability of the ecosystem are reliant in parts on some of its other components (i.e., BasicSwap and SMSG 2.0); however, the user experience, simplicity, and accessibility can be directly enhanced by optimizing the marketplace dApp itself, as well as its gateways.</p><p>As such, our strategy for the near and intermediate future regarding the Particl Marketplace is to introduce two separate applications: a seller app (seller dashboard) and a buyer-oriented web/mobile gateway.</p><p>Let’s explore each of these applications in more detail, and examine how they will work synergistically to significantly improve the Particl Marketplace.</p><h2 id=\"seller-dashboard-standalone-app-\">Seller Dashboard (Standalone App)</h2><p>The first application scheduled for release is a standalone seller dashboard to assist vendors on Particl Marketplace to manage their listings and activities. The dashboard is composed of three distinct sections:</p><p><strong>Remote Services Management:</strong> This suite of capabilities provides the means to manage connections to external services, such as WooCommerce and other eCommerce platforms (Shopify, Medusa, etc), inventory management systems, liquidity providers, and more.</p><p>The Particl Seller App is designed to integrate external services, granting sellers access to an ever-expanding range of eCommerce technologies, platforms, and plugins, and allowing them to leverage their various benefits directly on Particl Marketplace.</p><p><strong>Inventory and Listing Management:</strong> This category deals with anything inventory and listing related. This includes management of listing data, prices, and publishing methodology, among other functions.</p><p>Notably, the app will enable sellers to automatically republish listings on Particl Marketplace after expiration and to adjust PART prices in accordance with current coin value via the optional utilization of APIs. This will significantly improve the seller experience and minimize the time needed to manage and maintain Particl listings, which has been a widely requested improvement from Particl Marketplace sellers.</p><p><strong>Marketplace Activities:</strong> This category encompasses all activities related to the marketplace, including order management, customer communication, escrow progression, and more.</p><p>In the end, sellers will be able to carry out all their tasks and activities exclusively from the seller app, without the need for Particl Desktop.</p><h3 id=\"typical-flow\">Typical Flow</h3><p>In order to understand the full potential of what this application enables, let us examine a hypothetical example of how it might be used by a fictitious seller.</p><p>Alice, a dropshipper, has an eCommerce store powered by WooCommerce and is looking to expand her reach by utilizing the Particl Marketplace. She downloads the seller application and, with the help of the remote service manager, is able to seamlessly connect her WooCommerce store and import her full inventory with the press of a button. Additionally, due to a specific WooCommerce plugin she uses which dynamically updates her item prices based on supplier data, she opts to have her inventory on the seller app stay in sync with any changes made on WooCommerce.</p><p>Having imported her inventory, she now configures her Particl Marketplace account preferences. She opts to peg her listing prices to a fixed US dollar valuation, pushing the price update once daily and ensuring that her items stay listed on the marketplace consistently. As a renowned seller in her community with recurring buyers, she also decides to set her escrow rate at 0%. And then, to lock in the value of her sales, she opts to automatically swap PART to USDT when a sale is finalized; she proceeds to the remote services manager and enables a liquidity plugin for that purpose. Finally, she enables a function to automatically accept bids from certain countries to expedite the service she provides to her customers.</p><p>Then, as she receives orders, she can manage them all via the app, including dispatching tracking numbers, messages, and more, all without having to undergo Particl Desktop's extensive setup process.</p><h3 id=\"subsequent-improvements\">Subsequent Improvements</h3><p>The example described above illustrates a few of the advantages sellers will gain in terms of user experience, convenience, and added capabilities via external integrations. But this proposed seller app is merely the first phase of what is ultimately envisioned.</p><p>In later stages, we intend to integrate its range of features into a comprehensive web dashboard, enabling sellers to benefit from its features without requiring a software download.</p><p>We also plan on building a ready-made WooCommerce plugin that provides sellers with the same features of the app, but fed directly into their WooCommerce dashboard. This includes the ability to receive, accept, and manage Particl Marketplace orders inside WooCommerce’s regular dashboard, in addition to sending and receiving messages and other supplementary features. When complete, this will offer sellers the ability to list their inventory on Particl Marketplace with minimal disruption to their regular workflow, a considerable step towards simplifying the acquisition of new sellers.</p><p>This is earmarked as a subsequent stage of the seller app, and requires further exploration. Nevertheless, this should give you a good understanding of the potential that Particl's open, modular, and highly-interconnected architecture provides.</p><p>Ultimately, our goal is to incorporate a lot of these features into the desktop version of Particl Marketplace — which will remain the best solution for those looking for the maximum amount of decentralization and privacy — but first deploying them within a standalone application is a quicker path towards providing sellers with those much-needed improvements.</p><h2 id=\"marketplace-dapp-designed-for-buyers\">Marketplace dApp Designed for Buyers</h2><p>Even with the wide range of features and enhancements to the seller experience, we must not forget that Particl Marketplace is a two-way street. Without buyers, sellers cannot exist, and our plans for improvement would be incomplete without considering both sides of the equation.</p><p>That is why, subsequent to releasing the initial iterations of the seller app, the next step will be to develop a mobile and/or web edition of the marketplace, featuring an entirely redesigned user experience tailored to buyers.</p><p>This will give online purchasers a more straightforward user experience, ridding them of all superfluous vendor-related and technical features they don't need or care about, and making Particl Marketplace more akin to what one would generally expect from an online marketplace, while still benefiting from the advantages associated with its decentralized and privacy-first nature.</p><p>Although the exact features and functions of this app are yet to be determined, we can confidently say that our goal is to provide a buyer experience that is as streamlined and accessible as possible. To that end, we plan to focus on user-friendliness and the intuitiveness of its user interface, wider accessibility through either web browsers or a mobile application (or both), and providing a tailored experience that meets the specific needs of buyers.</p><p>Upon completion of both the buyer and seller applications, Particl's DeCommerce ecosystem will be able to provide privacy, decentralization, and freedom, while minimizing the usual drawbacks associated with those terms. In essence, by simplifying the use of Particl's DeCommerce products, the adoption potential of Particl Marketplace will inevitably be increased, bringing its benefits to as many people as ever.</p><h2 id=\"liquidity-solutions\">Liquidity Solutions</h2><p>Having great products is one thing — however, when it comes to Particl and DeCommerce, the liquidity of the underlying assets (in this case, PART pairs) is of equal importance.</p><p>This is why we are adding a remote services connector to the seller app, to work in tandem with BasicSwap DEX. With a modular and open approach to Particl, we can integrate different liquidity services, such as instant-fill orders on BSX, as well as third-party liquidity services for the marketplace, to facilitate the purchasing and selling of PART for DeCommerce purposes.</p><p>The incorporation of these systems offers market makers the chance to benefit from the emergence of DeCommerce and generate income from Particl Marketplace sales, by providing the essential liquidity users will inevitably need to tap into.</p><p>As we progress with the development of the aforementioned applications, we are also researching various liquidity plugin concepts. We believe those will significantly enhance the user experience of the marketplace and enable Particl to be a successful, autonomous economy that keeps its no-compromise approach to privacy and freedom.</p><h1 id=\"the-evolution-of-decommerce\">The Evolution of DeCommerce</h1><p>We hope that, by now, you have acquired an understanding of our short-to-medium-term plans for the Particl Marketplace and the substantial advantages of adapting Particl into a more open, connected, and modular system.</p><p>As we strive to enhance Particl Marketplace, please bear in mind that this is only one element of our broader vision for Particl to become a privacy-first and pro-liberty economy.

This is due to the fact that the SMSG network, which serves as the foundation of a significant portion of the Marketplace dApp, is also a main component of the BasicSwap DEX.</p><p>Consequently, should either of these two dApp's achieve considerable usage and generate large amounts of activity on the SMSG network, it could negatively affect the performance of other SMSG-dependent dApps.</p><p>In light of this, we have decided to begin work on a new version of SMSG, tentatively named SMSG 2.0. This new version will facilitate message distribution, allowing for a much more scalable ecosystem where high usage of individual dApps will not affect the performance of other dApps also utilizing the SMSG 2.0 network.</p><h1 id=\"new-decommerce-apps-coming-up\">New DeCommerce Apps Coming Up</h1><p>It can be said that the liquidity, agnosticism, and scalability of the ecosystem are reliant in parts on some of its other components (i.e., BasicSwap and SMSG 2.0); however, the user experience, simplicity, and accessibility can be directly enhanced by optimizing the marketplace dApp itself, as well as its gateways.</p><p>As such, our strategy for the near and intermediate future regarding the Particl Marketplace is to introduce two separate applications: a seller app (seller dashboard) and a buyer-oriented web/mobile gateway.</p><p>Let’s explore each of these applications in more detail, and examine how they will work synergistically to significantly improve the Particl Marketplace.</p><h2 id=\"seller-dashboard-standalone-app-\">Seller Dashboard (Standalone App)</h2><p>The first application scheduled for release is a standalone seller dashboard to assist vendors on Particl Marketplace to manage their listings and activities. The dashboard is composed of three distinct sections:</p><p><strong>Remote Services Management:</strong> This suite of capabilities provides the means to manage connections to external services, such as WooCommerce and other eCommerce platforms (Shopify, Medusa, etc), inventory management systems, liquidity providers, and more.</p><p>The Particl Seller App is designed to integrate external services, granting sellers access to an ever-expanding range of eCommerce technologies, platforms, and plugins, and allowing them to leverage their various benefits directly on Particl Marketplace.</p><p><strong>Inventory and Listing Management:</strong> This category deals with anything inventory and listing related. This includes management of listing data, prices, and publishing methodology, among other functions.</p><p>Notably, the app will enable sellers to automatically republish listings on Particl Marketplace after expiration and to adjust PART prices in accordance with current coin value via the optional utilization of APIs. This will significantly improve the seller experience and minimize the time needed to manage and maintain Particl listings, which has been a widely requested improvement from Particl Marketplace sellers.</p><p><strong>Marketplace Activities:</strong> This category encompasses all activities related to the marketplace, including order management, customer communication, escrow progression, and more.</p><p>In the end, sellers will be able to carry out all their tasks and activities exclusively from the seller app, without the need for Particl Desktop.</p><h3 id=\"typical-flow\">Typical Flow</h3><p>In order to understand the full potential of what this application enables, let us examine a hypothetical example of how it might be used by a fictitious seller.</p><p>Alice, a dropshipper, has an eCommerce store powered by WooCommerce and is looking to expand her reach by utilizing the Particl Marketplace. She downloads the seller application and, with the help of the remote service manager, is able to seamlessly connect her WooCommerce store and import her full inventory with the press of a button. Additionally, due to a specific WooCommerce plugin she uses which dynamically updates her item prices based on supplier data, she opts to have her inventory on the seller app stay in sync with any changes made on WooCommerce.</p><p>Having imported her inventory, she now configures her Particl Marketplace account preferences. She opts to peg her listing prices to a fixed US dollar valuation, pushing the price update once daily and ensuring that her items stay listed on the marketplace consistently. As a renowned seller in her community with recurring buyers, she also decides to set her escrow rate at 0%. And then, to lock in the value of her sales, she opts to automatically swap PART to USDT when a sale is finalized; she proceeds to the remote services manager and enables a liquidity plugin for that purpose. Finally, she enables a function to automatically accept bids from certain countries to expedite the service she provides to her customers.</p><p>Then, as she receives orders, she can manage them all via the app, including dispatching tracking numbers, messages, and more, all without having to undergo Particl Desktop's extensive setup process.</p><h3 id=\"subsequent-improvements\">Subsequent Improvements</h3><p>The example described above illustrates a few of the advantages sellers will gain in terms of user experience, convenience, and added capabilities via external integrations. But this proposed seller app is merely the first phase of what is ultimately envisioned.</p><p>In later stages, we intend to integrate its range of features into a comprehensive web dashboard, enabling sellers to benefit from its features without requiring a software download.</p><p>We also plan on building a ready-made WooCommerce plugin that provides sellers with the same features of the app, but fed directly into their WooCommerce dashboard. This includes the ability to receive, accept, and manage Particl Marketplace orders inside WooCommerce’s regular dashboard, in addition to sending and receiving messages and other supplementary features. When complete, this will offer sellers the ability to list their inventory on Particl Marketplace with minimal disruption to their regular workflow, a considerable step towards simplifying the acquisition of new sellers.</p><p>This is earmarked as a subsequent stage of the seller app, and requires further exploration. Nevertheless, this should give you a good understanding of the potential that Particl's open, modular, and highly-interconnected architecture provides.</p><p>Ultimately, our goal is to incorporate a lot of these features into the desktop version of Particl Marketplace — which will remain the best solution for those looking for the maximum amount of decentralization and privacy — but first deploying them within a standalone application is a quicker path towards providing sellers with those much-needed improvements.</p><h2 id=\"marketplace-dapp-designed-for-buyers\">Marketplace dApp Designed for Buyers</h2><p>Even with the wide range of features and enhancements to the seller experience, we must not forget that Particl Marketplace is a two-way street. Without buyers, sellers cannot exist, and our plans for improvement would be incomplete without considering both sides of the equation.</p><p>That is why, subsequent to releasing the initial iterations of the seller app, the next step will be to develop a mobile and/or web edition of the marketplace, featuring an entirely redesigned user experience tailored to buyers.</p><p>This will give online purchasers a more straightforward user experience, ridding them of all superfluous vendor-related and technical features they don't need or care about, and making Particl Marketplace more akin to what one would generally expect from an online marketplace, while still benefiting from the advantages associated with its decentralized and privacy-first nature.</p><p>Although the exact features and functions of this app are yet to be determined, we can confidently say that our goal is to provide a buyer experience that is as streamlined and accessible as possible. To that end, we plan to focus on user-friendliness and the intuitiveness of its user interface, wider accessibility through either web browsers or a mobile application (or both), and providing a tailored experience that meets the specific needs of buyers.</p><p>Upon completion of both the buyer and seller applications, Particl's DeCommerce ecosystem will be able to provide privacy, decentralization, and freedom, while minimizing the usual drawbacks associated with those terms. In essence, by simplifying the use of Particl's DeCommerce products, the adoption potential of Particl Marketplace will inevitably be increased, bringing its benefits to as many people as ever.</p><h2 id=\"liquidity-solutions\">Liquidity Solutions</h2><p>Having great products is one thing — however, when it comes to Particl and DeCommerce, the liquidity of the underlying assets (in this case, PART pairs) is of equal importance.</p><p>This is why we are adding a remote services connector to the seller app, to work in tandem with BasicSwap DEX. With a modular and open approach to Particl, we can integrate different liquidity services, such as instant-fill orders on BSX, as well as third-party liquidity services for the marketplace, to facilitate the purchasing and selling of PART for DeCommerce purposes.</p><p>The incorporation of these systems offers market makers the chance to benefit from the emergence of DeCommerce and generate income from Particl Marketplace sales, by providing the essential liquidity users will inevitably need to tap into.</p><p>As we progress with the development of the aforementioned applications, we are also researching various liquidity plugin concepts. We believe those will significantly enhance the user experience of the marketplace and enable Particl to be a successful, autonomous economy that keeps its no-compromise approach to privacy and freedom.</p><h1 id=\"the-evolution-of-decommerce\">The Evolution of DeCommerce</h1><p>We hope that, by now, you have acquired an understanding of our short-to-medium-term plans for the Particl Marketplace and the substantial advantages of adapting Particl into a more open, connected, and modular system.</p><p>As we strive to enhance Particl Marketplace, please bear in mind that this is only one element of our broader vision for Particl to become a privacy-first and pro-liberty economy. We seek to build usable, accessible, and easy to use applications that bring the benefits of privacy and uncompromising decentralization to as many people as possible, and we make important progress towards that goal every day.</p><h2 id=\"the-open-source-revolution\">The Open-Source Revolution</h2><p>Remaining mindful of our open-source origins, we strongly urge you to stay up-to-date with the progress being made concerning the platform's modularity. This will enable you to take advantage of a wealth of possibilities to create plugins, services, apps, and integrations that can optimize and expand the overall Particl ecosystem.</p><p>Also, if you’re not a developer and just have a great idea, you can also <a href=\"https://ccs.particl.io/\">make a proposal to the community</a>! Who knows, maybe a great concept that ends up revolutionizing the deCommerce game is really just one proposal away :^)</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr><h3 id=\"particl-is-participation\">Particl is Participation</h3><p>Get recognized as someone that cares.

You\ncan download and install it now and benefit from the most current and\nstreamlined Particl user experience available.\n\nThis is an important milestone for the desktop client and the project as a\nwhole, as it brings us one step closer to our goal of having a more modular and\nefficient ecosystem.\n\nWe'll delve deeper into this topic in this blog post, so let's get started!\n\n * Download Particl Desktop 3.3: \n   https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSeparation of Particl Core and Desktop ?\nThe major takeaway from this update is the decoupling of the Particl blockchain\nfrom the desktop client.\n\nFrom the outset, Particl Desktop v1.0 was entirely linked with Particl Core.\nThat's because, at the time of its launch, the desktop client lacked the\nmarketplace dApp component and was purely designed as a cryptocurrency wallet.\nTo be more precise, the marketplace itself wasn't initially designed as a\nstandalone dApp, but rather an added set of functionalities to the Particl\nwallet.\n\nAs the years progressed, Particl's vision developed into a more ambitious goal,\nnecessitating an extensive transformation of the desktop client's unified\narchitecture into a more adaptive and flexible design.\n\nParticl Desktop 3.3 makes significant strides towards establishing an\nindependent relationship between Particl Core and the desktop client by\nseparating them entirely, allowing them to coexist and operate harmoniously as\ndistinct pieces of software.\n\nFirst Steps Towards Modularity ⚙️\nThe reasoning behind separating Particl Core and Desktop is the first step\ntowards a more modular, open, and developer-friendly ecosystem. It signals the\nbeginning of the client's transformation from a \"cryptocurrency wallet with\nextra features\" into a fully-fledged sandbox for privacy-first dApps. \n\nThis development is expected to take place through a series of incremental\nchanges all throughout the new development cycle, each update working towards\nachieving our objective of modularity, openness, and enhanced efficiency.\n\nTo learn more about Particl's new (and now current) development cycle, please\nrefer to this extensive blog post\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/] on the topic.\n\nParticl’s Next Evolutionary Leap ForwardLearn about the team’s new major\ndevelopment cycle and discover Particl’s upcoming open-source foundation for\nthe\ndevelopment and deployment of privacy-first dApps.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/]General Bug Fixes\nand Improvements ?\nAside from this significant leap forward, this new release introduces a wide\nvariety of improvements, both architecturally and to the user experience. It\nalso and a few bugs and issues. You'll find the full changelog at the bottom of\nthis article. \n\nSeller Companion App is Next ?\nNow that Particl Desktop 3.3 is live on mainnet, work on the seller companion\napp begins. \n\nFor those who may have not seen it yet, here's an excerpt from one of our recent\nweekly development progress reports which outlines its nature and the planned\nfeatures for it.\n\n> The app will serve as an external inventory and order management system tailored\nfor Particl's \"power sellers\". It will enable sellers to create, manage, and\npublish listings, but also set up escrow rates, and manage shipping, orders, and\nchats. We also plan to add plenty of automation into the system — such as the\nauto-relisting of items, automated pricing updates, and auto-acceptance of\norders within specified parameters — to make selling on the marketplace more\nefficient and effortless.\n\nThe application will also allow sellers to connect their Particl inventory to\nexternal platforms, such as WooCommerce, to benefit from its multitude of\nfunctionality and flexible plugins. This will drastically reduce the workload of\nmanually maintaining marketplace content, especially when combined with\nautomated processes, and will make it much easier for sellers already selling\nstuff online to integrate Particl Marketplace as part of the range of platforms\nthey do business on. And of course, we fully expect it to grow the number of\nlistings available on the marketplace!\n\nThe app is set to be rolled out in successive feature updates, a notable step in\nthe direction of making Particl Marketplace more open and accessible, especially\nwhen paired with a web gateway later on during the coming development cycle. \n\nIn reality, it encapsulates the flexibility and cross-platform compatibility of\nParticl's proposed modular architecture, allowing the marketplace to connect\nwith other platforms and reach broader audiences with greater ease.\n\nAlthough this is a small — but important — piece of our marketplace dApp vision,\nit is a great example of what becomes possible with Particl as we progress\nthrough this infrastructural evolutionary phase.\n\nWe aim to make the entire ecosystem more accessible in the near future by\nintegrating new gateways, such as web access, and further developing its\ncomponents into open modules. This will result in Particl dApps being highly\nconvenient, accessible, and much easier to use.\n * Source: Particl Development Progress Report (03-02-2023)\n   [https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-03-02-2023/]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started\n * Download Particl Desktop 3.3: \n   https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0\n\nRelease Particl Desktop v3.3.0 · particl/particl-desktopParticl Desktop\nv3.3.0RELEASE INFORMATION BUILDPARTICL CORE (MIN VERSION)MARKETPLACE\nVERSIONWALLET VERSION 3.3.023.0.30.3.121.8.0 CHANGELOG[overview] [Linux OS]\nApplication name ...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.3.0]For those\nunfamiliar with Particl, we highly recommend exploring the Particl Academy as an\ninformative guide and resource for using Particl Desktop and the Particl\nMarketplace.\n\nOpen Particl Academy [https://academy.particl.io]\n\nNotes\n * Your wallet needs to be unlocked to process buy and sell orders on the\n   marketplace.\n * If you spot any issue, bug, or area of improvement, please report it directly\n   on the Github Issues [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] \n   page.\n\nAdvanced Start-up\nFor those interested, launching the application via the terminal offers\nreal-time log data.

It is not recommended to edit these by hand, but they can\n   be useful if something goes wrong and a setting is unavailable.\n * Completed a significant refactor to help move towards the goal of independent\n   apps/modules in the system (and/or independent blockchain networks).\n * Any attempt o download a new Particl Core binary or start a new binary now\n   occurs after the application has fully started, rather than blocking access\n   to the main application user interface until particl-core has been started.\n * Updated to use Particl Core v23\n\nParticl Core\n * Introduced a new module to allow for the configuration of when and how to\n   start the Particl Core binary/executable.\n * Particl Core will need to be correctly started and accessible in order to\n   access the apps/modules requiring Particl blockchain functionality.\n * Various Particl Core startup configuration options are presented in this\n   module, along with the ability to start or stop a Particl Core node (or\n   connect to an already running node).\n * Note that the settings per chain (mainnet/testnet/regtest) are stored\n   separately, and are updated whenever the chain being connected to is changed\n   (in the Startup menu option).\n * For advanced users, wanting to customize startup further: * the particl-core.json file in the settings directory/folder contains a\n      number of settings per chain (in addition to other settings).\n    * A params key can be placed into the JSON structure of the chain to be\n      configured; this params key should contain a value of an array/list of\n      strings, where each string is the CLI arg of the argument to pass to\n      particl core when starting it. These are not presented in the GUI, but\n      will be applied when attempting to start or connect to the configured\n      Particl chain.\n    * Any incorrect\n      values provided, or an invalid structure, or conflicting params can be\n      viewed in the appropriate log file.\n   \n   \n\nWallet Module\n * Updated after the refactor.\n * Includes minor bug fixes and improvements.\n * Added the ability to export the wallet History to a CSV file.\n * Updated the Settings page: removed the need to click a 'Save' button:\n   settings are now automatically saved once the input loses focus (if the value\n   provided is valid).\n * Added the ability to configure alternative external transaction and address\n   lookup URLs * these are configured according to the Particl chain currently\n      running.\n   \n   \n\nMarketplace dApp\n * Updated after the refactor.\n * Minor fixes and improvements made.\n * Added an indicator to the menu bar to indaicate when the current wallet is\n   locked and order updates may not be processed.\n * Updated the Settings page: removed the need to click a 'Save' button:\n   settings are now automatically saved once the input loses focus (if the value\n   provided is valid).\n * Added the ability to configure alternative external transaction URLs * these\n      are configured according to the Particl chain currently running.\n   \n   \n\nGovernance dApp\n * Updated after the refactor.\n * Minor fixes and improvements made.\n\nDesktop Settings\n * Added the ability to view the Terms and Conditions (not possible previously\n   once they had been accepted after first starting the application).\n * Added the option to toggle whether PD does its own update checks (the URL\n   where updates are queried can be configured in the appropriate settings JSON\n   file: the format of the response needs to be specific, but a script is\n   available to generate and host this file elsewhere if so desired).\n * Included the ability to configure external domains that Particl Desktop can\n   open in the browser. * IMPORTANT! Particl Desktop attempts to prevent unknown external domains\n      from being navigated to, unless they are included in a permitted/allowed\n      list. Some URLs. such as the local machine, the Particl block explorer,\n      and Github, are by default added to this allowed/permitted list. Thus, if\n      any of the transaction or address lookup URLs in the particl wallet or\n      particl market app/modules are changed/customized, ensure that the\n      configured URL (or the domain name at minimum) is also added to this\n      permitted list. Not including the custom domain in the permitted/allowed\n      list will present a prompt indicating that the URL cannot be navigated to.\n   \n   \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith Particl Desktop 3.3 now available on mainnet, we're thrilled to finally\nbegin this new and exciting development cycle poised to significantly improve\nParticl in almost every aspects.\n\nIf you haven't done so already, we, once again, highly recommend reading this\narticle [https://particl.news/particls-next-evolutionary-leap-forward/] which\nextensively details our plans moving forward. \n\nWe are immensely grateful for all the enthusiasm, contributions, and support we\nhave received from the Particl community.

that has been made in\nthe past few days. Let us take a moment to evaluate the advancements achieved in\nthe past few days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nWe've made great strides this week in finishing off the last remaining tasks\nbefore we can launch Particl Desktop 3.3 to mainnet. \n\nAs of now, only the CSV transaction data export feature is left to complete, and\nwe anticipate that it will be ready by the end of the weekend or early in the\nupcoming week.\n\nOnce that's taken care of, we'll commence the mainnet release process, which\nshould only take a few days. As such, we anticipate Particl Desktop 3.3 to go\nlive on mainnet as soon as next week. Then, we'll move on to working on the\nseller app we talked about last week.\n\nMarketplace Seller App ✅\nAs a reminder, here's an excerpt from last week's update which outlines the\nnature and planned features of the marketplace seller application which we'll\nstart working on right after the release of Particl Desktop 3.3 on mainnet.\n\n> The app will serve as an external inventory and order management system tailored\nfor Particl's \"power sellers\". It will enable sellers to create, manage, and\npublish listings, but also set up escrow rates, and manage shipping, orders, and\nchats. We also plan to add plenty of automation into the system — such as the\nauto-relisting of items, automated pricing updates, and auto-acceptance of\norders within specified parameters — to make selling on the marketplace more\nefficient and effortless.\n\nThe application will also allow sellers to connect their Particl inventory to\nexternal platforms, such as WooCommerce, to benefit from its multitude of\nfunctionality and flexible plugins. This will drastically reduce the workload of\nmanually maintaining marketplace content, especially when combined with\nautomated processes, and will make it much easier for sellers already selling\nstuff online to integrate Particl Marketplace as part of the range of platforms\nthey do business on. And of course, we fully expect it to grow the number of\nlistings available on the marketplace!\n\nThe app is set to be rolled out in successive feature updates, a notable step in\nthe direction of making Particl Marketplace more open and accessible, especially\nwhen paired with a web gateway later on during the coming development cycle.\n\nIn reality, it encapsulates the flexibility and cross-platform compatibility of\nParticl's proposed modular architecture, allowing the marketplace to connect\nwith other platforms and reach broader audiences with greater ease.\n\nAlthough this is a small — but important — piece of our marketplace dApp vision,\nit is a great example of what becomes possible with Particl as we progress\nthrough this infrastructural evolutionary phase.\n\nWe aim to make the entire ecosystem more accessible in the near future by\nintegrating new gateways, such as web access, and further developing its\ncomponents into open modules. This will result in Particl dApps being highly\nconvenient, accessible, and much easier to use — Last Week's Update\n[https://particl.news/particl-development-progress-report-27-01-2023/]\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As always, we\nconsistently stay up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version by regularly\nincorporating upstream updates into Particl Core. You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nThis week has seen the continued development of our initial market making\ncompanion app for BasicSwap DEX and its updated user interface.\n\nWe are delighted to announce that we are making continual progress in both\nareas, particularly concerning the user interface. Indeed, we anticipate that\nthe GUI version 2.0 will be completed by next week and will include the\nfollowing improvements:\n\n * Addition of a dark mode.\n * Addition of a new price charting system, including volumes.\n * New, improved user interface codebase.\n * Introduction of a wide variety of GUI improvements, tweaks, and changes based\n   on feedback from our beta testers.\n\n> Note: We're requiring additional time to wrap up the simple mode. For that\nreason, it won't be included in next week's GUI update, but should be ready\nshortly thereafter.\nVideo Tutorials ?️\nWe've started rolling out a series of BasicSwap tutorial videos on Particl's\nYoutube channel.

also due to institutional investments chasing this\nrising cryptocurrency trend. If it wasn’t already the case, the crypto world\ntruly became a bona fide industry, complete with billion-dollar institutions,\nand fiduciary responsibility over trillions of dollars from its biggest\ncentralized players. Following this new landscape, as the night to day, came the\ninterest of regulators and government bodies. Unfortunately, much of it is still\nto come.\n\nFor this reason and others, a lot of people enamored by cryptocurrency’s initial\npromises — an uncompromising, radically privacy-focused marriage between the\ninternet and mediums of exchange — have found themselves compelled to retreat\nfrom nearly all currently existing centralized crypto asset platforms. \n\nWhat we now call “privacy coins” began to show themselves as one of the only\nlegal shelters to existing and looming regulations (the ‘privacy’ distinction\nhere is even ironic, as it is clear as day that “a peer-to-peer electronic cash\nsystem” would need to confine itself to the decisions of two peers and two peers\nonly, with no inherent access or need for third parties to meddle with the\ndecisions of those two peers). This, of course, is only half the battle: where \nand how those privacy coins are to be traded is also at issue.\n\n\nRegulation and Privacy-Preserving Assets\nMonero, Dash, Particl, Firo and other privacy coins are spearheading many\ntechnologies in the ever-evolving domain of cryptic currency. With them,\nanonymous transactions, at least to people that understand the initial vision,\nestablished themselves as a necessary component of Satoshi’s famous whitepaper.\nAnd by extension, privacy-focused decentralized exchanges also revealed\nthemselves as necessary for said transactional privacy to take on any meaningful\nform.\n\nTrading exchanges, where most of the liquidity lies, are increasingly being\naffected by government regulations, transforming them to become highly regulated\nmen-in-the-middle of most trades. This is obviously anathema to the original\ncypherpunk vision of privacy coins and cryptocurrency in general — still, to\nthis day, most privacy coins are traded on centralized exchanges. \n\nThis is a fatal compromise on the very concept of private currencies, and a\ncritical obstacle for privacy technologies; but it is a reality that projects\nmust nonetheless navigate through, in compliance. \n\nThe question of liquidity is also to consider within this kind of hyper-private,\ndecentralized ethos. Well-populated, centralized exchanges and order books are\nthe norm, and for a long time were considered necessary for mass adoption. This,\nof course, lent itself to disasters, such as the FTX debacle\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/12/13/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-collapse-explained]\n, the BTC-e shutdown\n[https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/russian-national-and-bitcoin-exchange-charged-21-count-indictment-operating-alleged]\n, the BitFinex hack\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bitfinex-hacked-hongkong-idUSKCN10E0KP], and\nothers. Most cryptocurrency users came to understand this the hard way: although\ndecentralized exchange adoption is still lacking, it seems “holding your own\nkeys” is now more ingrained into the crypto psyche than it ever was.\n\nHyper-privacy and the AMM Model\nAnother noteworthy, but often overlooked, compromise on total privacy and\nresilience is the current (some say, inherent) state of automated market makers,\nor AMMs. AMMs are essential to the vast majority of currently existing DEX\nexchanges and bring us one step closer to leaving custodial solutions behind for\ngood. However, they are not without flaws: impermanent losses and associated\nfees are commonly cited, but AMM-based models actually have to contend with many\npotential vulnerabilities, with regard to both security and privacy.\n\nFrom a security perspective, smart contracts and the complex collaborations\nbetween them can, of course, lead to potential protocol vulnerabilities. BSX, by\ndesign, opts for “lower-level” alternatives to smart contracts deemed safer,\nsuch as scriptless scripts and adaptor signatures\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-dex/basicswap_technicals.html].\nOn the other hand, AMM liquidity pools often make heavy use of smart contracts,\nwhich have in the past made them targets of malicious attacks such as \nreentrancy\nattacks [https://hackernoon.com/hack-solidity-reentrancy-attack], among many\nothers. Reentrancy attacks occur when a trusted smart contract makes an external\ncall to a separate, untrusted smart contract, in order to exploit a potential\nbug in the code which would allow it to drain or manipulate smart contract\nassets. This can have devastating effects on targeted liquidity pools, and by\nextension to AMM liquidity providers - the Siren protocol, which was victim of\nsuch a hack in 2021\n[https://halborn.com/explained-the-siren-protocol-hack-september-2021/] to the\ntune of $3.5 million dollars, is merely one example out of many.\n\nOther security contingencies that AMM liquidity providers have to contend with\ninclude oracle attacks\n[https://medium.com/harvest-finance/harvest-flashloan-economic-attack-post-mortem-3cf900d65217]\n, block timestamp manipulation\n[https://cryptomarketpool.com/block-timestamp-manipulation-attack], and the\ninfamous rug pulls that have become far too common. The semi-centralized aspects\nof AMMs, especially AMMs powered by in-house tokens such as Sushiswap or\nPancakeSwap, also amount to a security flaw in some respects, as the only way to\nensure that liquidity providers on AMMs are consistently profitable is often by\ncounteracting losses with heavy, hyper-inflationary financial incentives in the\nform of newly created native tokens.\n\nPotential privacy vulnerabilities within AMM models are also to be considered.\nIt is absolutely necessary for the BSX protocol to be entirely impervious to\nblockchain analysis and identity tracing to safeguard the personal safety of its\nusers — especially when swapping directly with unknown parties — which is a\npotential liability that most AMM-based DEXs, even ones that rely on standard\natomic swaps, have to contend with. \n\nTo that end, BSX employs adaptor signatures\n[https://github.com/ElementsProject/scriptless-scripts/blob/master/md/atomic-swap.md] \nto allow for completely hidden atomic swaps, without any sort of matching hashes\non participating blockchains, thus preventing any sort of analysis or\nlinkability of transactions over time. In combination with that, BasicSwap’s\ntype of order book, where one can pick and choose offers instead of having to\nfollow bid and ask curves, provides a user experience that is similar to that of\ncentralized exchanges but ensures total obfuscation of what is being traded and\nwhen. This ensures that the protocol is highly resilient against analysis,\nincluding identity tracing and behavioral model inference.\n\nIt is also worth noting that “DEX” exchanges that are confined to one chain, or\nits clones (via “bridges”), also come with their own fatal compromises on\nabsolute privacy and security, as exemplified by critical vulnerabilities\n[https://blockworks.co/news/secret-network-crypto-transactions-not-so-secret-after-all] \ndiscovered in November of last year.\n\nCommunity Liquidity with BasicSwap\nThe above considerations and the harsh reality of difficult and complex\nregulations which projects must navigate through, in compliance, weigh heavily\nin the protocol design of BasicSwap, especially with regard to encouraging\nliquidity within the network without sacrificing security or privacy. \n\nBasicSwap, a free and completely cross-chain decentralized trading protocol\nusing a novel implementation of atomic swap-based trading and the SMSG network\n[https://particl.news/the-smsg-network-enabling-dapps-with-true-privacy/], is\nmeant as a zero-compromise alternative for private peer-to-peer trades - that\nmeans a lot of liquidity solutions available for other decentralized exchanges,\neven ones with an eye for privacy, are rejected by BasicSwap as privacy\ncompromises on one level or another. Providing liquidity responsibly and safely\nhas traditionally been one of the bigger challenges for trustless exchanges\nbetween peers, and while solutions do exist and will no doubt continue to be\nbuilt and improved upon, they must ultimately satisfy a strict list of criteria\nin order to fit with the end goal of the BasicSwap protocol.\n\nTo this end, BSX also opted for an entirely user-supported and distributed\norderbook-like format for trades, similar to what is typically seen on\ncentralized trading exchanges, minus the centralized, intermediated aspects.\nThis hardline, no-compromise approach is by design; whenever you trade Monero,\nParticl, PIVX, Dash, or other coins on BSX, not only do you help yourself by\nbecoming more resilient against the possible threats that centralized exchanges\nand AMM DEX solutions bring, but you also do your part in improving the\nblockchain’s resilience against privacy-targeting attacks of all kinds. Simply\nby deciding to trade your crypto on such an exchange, you make privacy coins and\ntheir ecosystems more private and more unstoppable, by leaving no trace behind.\n\nThat is why we invite you, if you care about privacy as we do, to spread the\nword about BasicSwap\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-dex/basicswap_explained.html] \nand the existential issues that centralized and AMM DEX solutions bring to\nuncompromising privacy and security. It is free to use, open source, does not\nrely on native tokens, and involves absolutely no KYC or account requirements —\nthis arrangement offers only advantages for both you and the networks of the\ncoins you’re trading.\n\nEvery little bit helps, and we can all be a big part of this fight for our\nfreedoms and privacy. Even if this seems like a small step to you, bringing even\none person to trade their privacy coins on a decentralized exchange like BSX can\nhave a profound impact!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you would like to deepen your understanding of atomic swaps and their new,\nhyper-private type powered by Adaptor Signatures, make sure to give these\nfollowing articles a read!\n\n * The DEX Revolution Pt. 1\n   [https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n * The DEX Revolution Pt. 2\n   [https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-basicswap-and-web-access-considerations/]\n * The DEX Revolution Pt. 3\n   [https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-basicswap-and-private-ethereum-swaps/]\n * Bidirectional Monero and PART (Anon) Atomic Swaps\n   [https://particl.news/bidirectional-part-anon-and-xmr-atomic-swaps-now-live-on-basicswap-dex/]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJoin the discussion\nWhat's your stance?
