met in South Africa \nfrom the 16th of November to the 24th for a series of important development\nmeetings that would shape the short to mid-term path forward for the project.\n\nContrary to previous meetings held in Prague and Switzerland where mostly the\ncore group met, this one was planned to gather most of the developers as well as\nsome members of the communications team together. It presented itself as a great\nopportunity for the team members to meet the co-workers they’ve been working\nwith for some time (and in some cases, years), as well as being the perfect\nopportunity to get as many heads working together and brainstorming as possible.\n\nThere’s one thing that is absolutely sure and that definitely stands up the\nminute these meetings start: the level of expertise, knowledge, and passion\nwithin the team is simply out of this world! On their own, each of the team\nmembers is quite impressive in terms of skills. When they get together, however,\nthat’s when the magic happens.\n\nGetting Particl Marketplace Beta Ready\nThe meetings were, for the most part, exclusively focused on the development and\nmanagement of the project with a particular look on the short to mid-term.\n\nThe development team first focused on what needed to be done more urgently in\nregards to the finalization of the Beta version of Particl Marketplace. Suffice\nto say, we are definitely getting to the very end of the Alpha stage of\ndevelopment and only minor tweaks and additions (notably linked to software\nstability and governance) are still left to add. While that is not necessarily\nfresh news, it does confirm that we might only be weeks away from the release of\nthe long-awaited Beta version of the marketplace, on testnet first of course.\n\nIt was also discussed that Particl Marketplace Beta might release initially as a\nLite Beta, then followed by more frequent than now Release Candidates, each of\nthem adding a new feature not present in the previous version. For example, it\nis very likely that the very first Release Candidate of Particl Marketplace Beta\nmight not contain RingCT/CT privacy features integrated into the escrow system\nas Tecnovert is still working on improving the RingCT protocol with\nprivacy-enhancing tweaks as well as Bulletproofs.\n\nIt was also heavily considered by the team that Particl Marketplace Beta, once\nstable enough and properly tested, might hit mainnet before Particl Marketplace\n1.0 is fully completed. The timeline of the mainnet release is of course not\navailable as a lot of it depends on moving targets and at how fast the platform\ncan be made stable enough to use with real money. This early mainnet period will\nbe extremely useful to test the dynamics of the many decentralized mechanisms in\nplace within the platform such as MAD escrow, anti-spam measures, governance,\nand etc.\n\nPost-Beta Items\nAnother very important task of this series of meetings was to draw an internal\nroadmap of development tasks and decide on what is going to be worked on after \nthe release of the Beta version of the marketplace. One of the decisions the\ndevelopers took was to now mostly focus on one feature at a time instead of\nworking on many at once. This will definitely help in releasing new features\nwith each Release Candidates and publish them in shorter timeframes as they are\nright now.\n\nDISCLAIMER: What follows is a list of items the development team will most\nlikely be working on after the initial release of Particl Marketplace Beta.\nItems are placed in no particular order and there is no public timeline \navailable for these. As with everything development-related, some of these items\nmay be abandoned and new ones might start being worked before others, and thus\nnone of what follows can be interpreted as “promises”. The purpose of this list\nis only to give you a general idea of what the team currently has in mind.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMarketplace-Related\n> IPFS: IPFS stands for Interplanetary File System, and is a decentralized data\nstorage network\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/overview.html] \n(DSN). Particl Marketplace will use IPFS to store messages and data, which is\nexpected to reduce listing fees as well as increase the quality of the uploaded\ndata (i.e. listing pictures in higher quality).Note that, while IPFS will make\nit more affordable to use the marketplace, it does not provide the user with the\nsame level of privacy as SMSG\n[https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/smsg.html],\nParticl’s current default DSN. This is why the marketplace will likely default\nwith IPFS and allow to manually change the default DSN in the Settings page.\nFollow the link below to get more information about IPFS.\n\nWhat is IPFS? [https://medium.com/wolverineblockchain/what-is-ipfs-b83277597da5]\nIPFS stands for Interplanetary File System. At its core it is a versioned file\nsystem which can store files and track…\n[https://medium.com/wolverineblockchain/what-is-ipfs-b83277597da5]medium.com\n[https://medium.com/wolverineblockchain/what-is-ipfs-b83277597da5]\n\n> Reputation System: Many of you will be happy to see this item. Vendor reputation\nis an almost necessary information for buyers when shopping online and has been\nrequested by a lot of you from the community. While the exact implementation and\nmechanism still remain unsettled for the moment, this is one of the items that\nwill eventually make its way onto Particl Marketplace.Payment Gateways: As a\ncore aspect of our vision, Particl Marketplace is designed to be a marketplace\nwhere many different cryptocurrencies are accepted. Thus, a gateway, initially\none for Bitcoin-only, will be integrated on Particl Marketplace. The initial\nintegration might probably be a third-party integration, but as proper\ndecentralized solutions rise up, expect the team to keep a close eye on them and\nwork towards integrating solutions aligned with our own vision.\nPrice Pegging: Important for a smooth user experience as well as mainstream\nadoption, price pegging is the ability to price an item according to the\ncurrency of your choice. It means a vendor could decide, for example, to sell an\nitem for $150 USD, and that item would still remain listed at $150 regardless of\nthe PART coin price fluctuation. Price pegging will also make it possible for\npeople to display posted listings in the currency of their choice.\nVendor/Buyer Communication: The ability to message the other party in a \nmutually\nassured destruction [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction] \nscenario, the game-theory scenario on which Particl Marketplace’s MAD escrow is\ndesigned), is tricky.\nOn one hand, it is necessary for vendors and buyers to be able to communicate\nbetween each other. On the other hand, it needs to be done in a way that reduces\nthe risk of the vendor blackmailing the buyer to a minimum. Ultimately, if there\nis no way for involved parties to communicate within the platform, it is simply\ngoing to be taken off-platform.\nThis is why the team has decided to craft a special communication system where\nblackmailing possibilities will be reduced to a minimum. We will give more\ndetails about the messaging system once we are getting closer to its release\nMessaging System: While not exclusive to the marketplace, the messaging system\nwill also be available, in full, but without buyer/vendor relationship. This\nwill render possible individual and group chats directly from within Particl\nDesktop, a feature that will make secure messaging as easy and effortless as\nwriting a normal message on any other application. This messaging system will be\nparticularly useful for Particl Bubble members (people possessing the Market ID\nof private/community markets) to really bond together and foster sub-communities\nwithin the marketplace itself.\nFiat Payment Gateways: Fiat payment gateways are integrations that allow users\nto pay for items on Particl Marketplace using more traditional means of payments\nsuch as a credit card. It’s important to note that, for convenience and legal\nreasons, this particular item may never make its way onto Particl Marketplace at\nany point in time. While this is an item that is being seriously considered and\nactively researched by the team, a payment solution would need to be compatible\nwith our own vision and not require the user to go through numerous tedious\nsteps in order to be integrated into Particl Desktop.\nEscrow Refunds & Recovery: One way Particl’s MAD escrow can become problematic\nis if one of the two parties isn’t able to access the smart-contract anymore,\nthus making it impossible to retrieve any funds or complete a transaction. This\nis why the team will be focused on building a refund and recovery option for the\nescrow system in order to make it more secure and resilient to unforeseen\nproblems.\nCode refactoring: As Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring] \nputs it, “code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer\ncode — changing the factoring — without changing its external behavior.”. This\nrefactoring process, already underway, will make Particl Marketplace much faster\nand smoother to use. This aims at giving the marketplace the same level of\nresponsiveness you would expect from web-based platforms.\nTranslations: Not exclusive to the marketplace, translations will eventually\nmake their way onto Particl Desktop. It will then be possible for you to\nregister on the Particl translation team and contribute on making Particl\nDesktop available in your favourite language using Transifex\n[https://www.transifex.com/].\nShipping Carrier Integration: A possible, yet not guaranteed, integration the\nteam has been wanting to have is for shipping carrier information to be able to\nbe tracked directly from within the marketplace itself. In other words, this\nintegration would allow you to track your orders without having to leave\nParticl. Another good step towards convenience!\nFollow a Vendor: This self-explanatory feature will allow you the follow your\nfavorite vendors on the marketplace. The exact implementation hasn’t been\ndecided on, but it is likely that, for privacy reasons, it will be an opt-in\noption for vendors to allow their customers to follow them around.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCore-Related\n> Latest Bitcoin Codebase: As always, we are committed to keeping the Particl\ncodebase up-to-date with Bitcoin’s. This allows the project to benefit from all\nthe breakthroughs made to the Bitcoin codebase, some of which being directly\nincluded into this list.RingCT Improvements: As stated for a few weeks now, our\nLead Cryptographer & Core Developer, Tecnovert, has been making a few tweaks on\nthe RingCT protocol. These tweaks are specifically intended to make the RingCT\nprotocol more private than it currently is on other coins’ implementations.\nBecause of the nature of these tweaks, we cannot reveal any detail at this\nmoment as to keep the exclusivity on the improvements.\nBulletproofs: The Bulletproofs protocol improvement allows RingCT transactions\nto be dramatically reduced in size, making them cheaper to send as well as more\nlightweight on the blockchain. This will greatly help the Particl blockchain to\nstay as scalable and fast to sync as possible over a long period of time.\nLightning Network: The Lightning Network allows transactions to be sent at a\nnear-instant speed and at near-zero cost. The implementation of this protocol is\nexpected to be one of the main areas of focus for Tecnovert this year. It will\nhelp with the execution of atomic swaps, the scalability of the network, as well\nas potentially be made available with private transactions.\nSidechains: Another area of interest for 2019, as mentioned by Tecnovert, is the\nresearch and development of side-chain solutions for Particl. As defined by \nHackerNoon [https://hackernoon.com/what-are-sidechains-1c45ea2daf3], a “\nsidechain is a separate blockchain\n[https://hackernoon.com/blockchains-versus-traditional-databases-c1a728159f79] \nthat is attached to its parent blockchain using a two-way peg”. No additional\ninformation concerning sidechains on Particl is publicly available yet, so stay\non alert for more information about this in 2019!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll in all, the South Africa team meeting has been super productive and have\nreally helped pave the way for the next few months to be impactful for the\nproject. With new developers, like Rob, jumping on board, it can only be\nexpected that the development pace is going to keep increasing as time goes. The\nteam is now really well organized with development managers and agile\nmethodologies which makes Particl’s future really look bright.\n\nP.S.: Don’t miss our blog post early next week where we will reveal a big\nconference Particl will be attending next year with a booth, a presence that was\nconcretized while we were in South Africa!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/South-Africa-Team-Meetings-Update/1-T3ZHDBgILfKJxfTO7-ZiYg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/South-Africa-Team-Meetings-Update/1-uvoqDP5zna4QKYLJgBLUog.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>As you probably already know, the Particl development team met in <strong>South Africa</strong> from the <strong>16th of November to the 24th</strong> for a series of important development meetings that would shape the short to mid-term path forward for the project.</p><p>Contrary to previous meetings held in Prague and Switzerland where mostly the core group met, this one was planned to gather most of the developers as well as some members of the communications team together.

Particl Marketplace will use </em><em><strong>IPFS</strong></em><em> to store messages and data, which is expected to reduce listing fees as well as increase the quality of the uploaded data (i.e. listing pictures in higher quality).</em><em>Note that, while </em><em><strong>IPFS</strong></em><em> will make it more affordable to use the marketplace, it does not provide the user with the same level of privacy as </em><a href=\"https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/smsg.html\"><em><strong>SMSG</strong></em></a><em>, Particl’s current default DSN.

At its core it is a versioned file system which can store files and track…</em></a><a href=\"https://medium.com/wolverineblockchain/what-is-ipfs-b83277597da5\">medium.com</a></p><blockquote><em><strong>Reputation System: </strong></em><em>Many of you will be happy to see this item.</em><em><strong> </strong></em><em>Vendor reputation is an almost necessary information for buyers when shopping online and has been requested by a lot of you from the community. While the exact implementation and mechanism still remain unsettled for the moment, this is one of the items that will eventually make its way onto Particl Marketplace.</em><em><strong>Payment Gateways: </strong></em><em>As a core aspect of our vision, Particl Marketplace is designed to be a marketplace where many different cryptocurrencies are accepted. Thus, a gateway, </em><em><strong>initially one for Bitcoin-only</strong></em><em>, will be integrated on Particl Marketplace. The initial integration might probably be a third-party integration, but as proper decentralized solutions rise up, expect the team to keep a close eye on them and work towards integrating solutions aligned with our own vision.</em><br><em><strong>Price Pegging:</strong></em><em> Important for a smooth user experience as well as mainstream adoption, price pegging is the ability to price an item according to the currency of your choice. It means a vendor could decide, for example, to sell an item for $150 USD, and that item would still remain listed at $150 regardless of the PART coin price fluctuation. Price pegging will also make it possible for people to display posted listings in the currency of their choice.</em><br><em><strong>Vendor/Buyer Communication:</strong></em><em> The ability to message the other party in a </em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction\"><em><strong>mutually assured destruction</strong></em></a><em><strong> </strong></em><em>scenario, the game-theory scenario on which Particl Marketplace’s MAD escrow is designed), is tricky.</em><br><em>On one hand, it is necessary for vendors and buyers to be able to communicate between each other. On the other hand, it needs to be done in a way that reduces the risk of the vendor blackmailing the buyer to a minimum. Ultimately, if there is no way for involved parties to communicate within the platform, it is simply going to be taken off-platform.</em><br><em>This is why the team has decided to craft a special communication system where blackmailing possibilities will be reduced to a minimum. We will give more details about the messaging system once we are getting closer to its release</em><br><em><strong>Messaging System:</strong></em><em> While not exclusive to the marketplace, the messaging system will also be available, in full, but without buyer/vendor relationship. This will render possible individual and group chats directly from within Particl Desktop, a feature that will make secure messaging as easy and effortless as writing a normal message on any other application. This messaging system will be particularly useful for Particl Bubble members (people possessing the Market ID of private/community markets) to really bond together and foster sub-communities within the marketplace itself.</em><br><em><strong>Fiat Payment Gateways:</strong></em><em> Fiat payment gateways are integrations that allow users to pay for items on Particl Marketplace using more traditional means of payments such as a credit card. It’s important to note that, for convenience and legal reasons, this particular item </em><em><strong>may never make its way onto Particl Marketplace at any point in time</strong></em><em>. While this is an item that is being seriously considered and actively researched by the team, a payment solution would need to be compatible with our own vision and not require the user to go through numerous tedious steps in order to be integrated into Particl Desktop.</em><br><em><strong>Escrow Refunds &#x26; Recovery:</strong></em><em> One way Particl’s MAD escrow can become problematic is if one of the two parties isn’t able to access the smart-contract anymore, thus making it impossible to retrieve any funds or complete a transaction. This is why the team will be focused on building a refund and recovery option for the escrow system in order to make it more secure and resilient to unforeseen problems.</em><br><em><strong>Code refactoring:</strong></em><em> As </em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring\"><em><strong>Wikipedia</strong></em></a><em> puts it, “</em>code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code — changing the factoring — without changing its external behavior.<em>”. This refactoring process, already underway, will make Particl Marketplace much faster and smoother to use. This aims at giving the marketplace the same level of responsiveness you would expect from web-based platforms.</em><br><em><strong>Translations:</strong></em><em> Not exclusive to the marketplace, translations will eventually make their way onto Particl Desktop. It will then be possible for you to register on the Particl translation team and contribute on making Particl Desktop available in your favourite language using </em><a href=\"https://www.transifex.com/\"><em><strong>Transifex</strong></em></a><em>.</em><br><em><strong>Shipping Carrier Integration:</strong></em><em> A possible, yet not guaranteed, integration the team has been wanting to have is for shipping carrier information to be able to be tracked directly from within the marketplace itself. In other words, this integration would allow you to </em><em><strong>track your orders </strong></em><em>without having to leave Particl. Another good step towards convenience!</em><br><em><strong>Follow a Vendor: </strong></em><em>This self-explanatory feature will allow you the follow your favorite vendors on the marketplace. The exact implementation hasn’t been decided on, but it is likely that, for privacy reasons, it will be an </em><em><strong>opt-in option</strong></em><em> for vendors to allow their customers to follow them around.</em><br></blockquote><hr><h3 id=\"core-related\">Core-Related</h3><blockquote><em><strong>Latest Bitcoin Codebase:</strong></em><em> As always, we are committed to keeping the Particl codebase up-to-date with Bitcoin’s. This allows the project to benefit from all the breakthroughs made to the Bitcoin codebase, some of which being directly included into this list.</em><em><strong>RingCT Improvements: </strong></em><em>As stated for a few weeks now, our Lead Cryptographer &#x26; Core Developer, Tecnovert, has been making a few tweaks on the RingCT protocol. These tweaks are specifically intended to make the RingCT protocol </em><em><strong>more private</strong></em><em> than it currently is on other coins’ implementations. Because of the nature of these tweaks, we cannot reveal any detail at this moment as to keep the exclusivity on the improvements.</em><br><em><strong>Bulletproofs: </strong></em><em>The Bulletproofs protocol improvement allows RingCT transactions to be dramatically reduced in size, making them cheaper to send as well as more lightweight on the blockchain. This will greatly help the Particl blockchain to stay as scalable and fast to sync as possible over a long period of time.</em><br><em><strong>Lightning Network:</strong></em><em> The Lightning Network allows transactions to be sent at a near-instant speed and at near-zero cost. The implementation of this protocol is expected to be one of the main areas of focus for Tecnovert this year. It will help with the execution of atomic swaps, the scalability of the network, as well as potentially be made available with private transactions.</em><br><em><strong>Sidechains:</strong></em><em> Another area of interest for 2019, as mentioned by Tecnovert, is the research and development of side-chain solutions for Particl. As defined by </em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/what-are-sidechains-1c45ea2daf3\"><em><strong>HackerNoon</strong></em></a><em>, a “</em>sidechain is a separate <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/blockchains-versus-traditional-databases-c1a728159f79\">blockchain</a> that is attached to its parent blockchain using a <strong>two-way peg</strong><em>”. No additional information concerning sidechains on Particl is publicly available yet, so stay on alert for more information about this in 2019!</em><br></blockquote><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/South-Africa-Team-Meetings-Update/1-3n7YDagbgGqIS5-IMFT9CA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>All in all, the South Africa team meeting has been super productive and have really helped pave the way for the next few months to be impactful for the project.

Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAMA/FAQ Livestream Summary\nWhen is the RingCT and governance hardfork is going to happen?\nThere is no official date set for it yet, and the plan to combine RingCT and\ngovernance into the same hardfork hasn’t changed since we last spoke about it.\nTecnovert is still working on some RingCT improvements on stability,\nperformance, and security, and wants to complete those before releasing it on\nmainnet. He did start to officially work on the Bulletproofs implementation and\nso it is likely that it will hit mainnet WITH bulletproofs included.\n\nDoes the Particl team plans on integrating a lock-up time for PART coins when\nthey are unlocked for staking so that coins are locked for a longer time and\ncan’t be moved/staked/sold before your node finds a block?\nIn short, it is not an immediate issue we are targeting. While this might be a\ngood idea, in theory, to make it more difficult for people to accumulate coins\nand then misuse them to attack the project by abusing the Proof-of-Stake\nprotocol, such as measure would likely severely handicap Particl as a currency.\nThis isn’t to say that a similar measure won’t ever be considered or\nimplemented, after all, Particl is all about security, but right now the focus\nis mostly on Particl Marketplace and Particl Desktop. It’s important to note\nthat we have a Research & Development team constantly putting up to test,\nresearching, and evaluating the many solutions popping up all over the industry,\nmeaning that our team is pro-actively putting your security at the highest\npriority.\n\nOne interesting dynamics related to this question specifically is how Particl\nMarketplace’s escrow mechanism, which is based on the MAD game-theory and\nrequires double security deposits from both vendors and buyers, will actually\nlock some of the supply out of circulation. In fact, both vendors and buyers\nneed to deposit funds into an escrow smart-contract to ensure both parties’\nhonesty. This, in turn, results in a portion of the supply being locked.\nContrary to the proposed solution in this question, having some of the supply\nlocked through the marketplace’s escrow is much more organic and less intrusive,\nas everyone who’s going to contribute to this “lock up” will do so in a\nperfectly voluntary basis, as opposed to being “forced” to lock some coins up\nfor an extended period of time by the protocol. This is a scenario we believe to\nbe more fair to the users and less handicapping. Additionally, in the future,\nmore Dapps could make use of Particl’s decentralized escrow mechanism and lock\neven more supply out of circulation, especially once we release the developed\nSDK toolkit. This will make it considerably harder for attackers to acquire\nlarge sums of coins and misuse them against the network (although that behavior\nis akin to an “economic suicide” from the attacker’s standpoint).\n\nLooking at recent events with Charlie Shrem, does he have access to any\ndocumentation or internal chats?\nNo, none of our advisors have any access to internal chats and documents, except\nfor Joe Fisher which has been heavily involved with Particl Marketplace lately\n(as per his experience as a career product inventor and online seller). All of\nCharlie’s communication with the team has been done through private messages.\nLike any other company that would have one of its advisors accused of some\nmisbehavior, we’re adopting a wait and see approach to the situation, instead\ndeciding to keep a close eye on the situation rather than proceed to hasty\nconclusions. Should Charlie Shrem be recognized guilty of the allegations made\nagainst him, we will have no choice but to distance ourselves from him and his\nbrand. Until that point, we’re staying alert to the situation.\n\nWill Particl hire a market maker and make deals with bigger exchanges\nlike Binance?\nIt seems that some representative from Binance may be hanging in our community\nand chatrooms as we get some pretty pointed questions from them from times to\ntimes regarding happenings, updates, and news we publish. While in reality, this\nmay not mean anything, it is definitely a good thing for the industry in general\nthat this exchange is keeping itself super diligent. Some of their questions are\nactually pretty good and shows they really are keeping a close eye on what’s\nhappening surrounding the project.\n\nRight now, we’re mostly focused on larger exchanges such as, of course, Binance,\nbut also Coinbase, Circle, Poloniex, Bitfinex, and other similarly large\nexchanges. We do not focus on smaller exchanges that are asking for a listing\nfee and that we believe wouldn’t yield us some return (in terms of community\ngrowth) on our investment. This is directly in line with our responsible fund\nmanagement strategy and part of the reason why we are guaranteed to have funds\nfor development for at least until the end of Q1 2019 (after which an additional\nfunding round will be in sight).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNews & Updates\nStatus Report\nParticl.io * Privacy-focused Decentralized Applications\n[http://particl.io/status-report/]\nParticl provides a decentralized privacy platform with a suite of tools to\nenhance your online privacy * Private… [http://particl.io/status-report/]\nparticl.io [http://particl.io/status-report/]\n\nAs always, a new Status Report was published at the same time we did our last\nlivestream. This report indicates a couple of items to be completed, such as \nuniformed height of listing items, drag’n’drop capability added when adding\nlistings, and proposals/votes to be based on time instead of blocks. Newly added\nto the In Development section are the governance system coin weight system, \nprivate markets, and proposal enhancements. As always, Tecnovert is still\nworking on improving the RingCT implementation with enhancements and \nBulletproofs. The current team meeting in South Africa is likely to shape future\nStatus Report and further the internal roadmap.\n\nConferences & Meetups\n> \nAs we have been saying lately, our intention is to start getting a more direct\nexposure by directly reaching out to the most passionate individuals of the\ncrypto scene by getting a better exposure at various crypto events. Nothing\nbeats the human interaction of discussing in-person the subject we are all\npassionate about!\n\n> \nOur newest team member, Lina Seiche, was specifically hired with this in mind\nand has already started integrating Particl into the blockchain presentations\nshe had already scheduled. Because she is seemingly falling in love with\nParticl, and also because of her own company, block-chats\n[https://block-chats.com/], it is to be expected that Particl will now be\nintegrated into most of their events, in some way or the other, in addition to\nthe Particl-themed events she’ll be organizing.\n\nAs such, she’s started planning the first of many future Particl-themed events.\nIn fact, on the 14th of December, Particl is going to hold its first official\nevent in Manilla, Philippines. This Christmas-themed Particl event will not only\nfocus on Particl but will also hold a panel of experts and well-known blockchain\npublic figures in that region. The panel will focus on eCommerce and why it is\nin dire need of decentralization and will be composed of leaders in the\nPhilippines blockchain industry such as:\n\n * Miguel Cuneta — Co-Founder of SCI [https://sci.ph/] & Particl Advisor\n * Mark Vernon — Founder of TagCash [https://tagcash.com/], a large\n   Philippines-based crypto company and very well-known within the Asian\n   community\n * Chris Verceles — Blockchain developer at Consensys [https://consensys.net/]\n * Colin Goltra — Head of Cryptocurrency Program at Coin.ph [https://coins.ph/]\n * Gerb Inajada — Head of Blockchain Technology at UnionBank\n   [https://www.unionbank.com/]\n * Alenna Dawn Magpantay — Philippines Ambassador for Coding Girls\n   [https://www.coding-girls.com/]\n\nFor more information about this event, please follow these links: \nhttps://block-chats.com/christmas-fair-2018/ & \nhttps://www.meetup.com/BlockChatsPhilippines/events/256492831/\n\nWe’ve also have been reaching out to our key contacts within the French\ncommunity and are planning a meetup/conference in Paris shortly. We will give\nmore information about this one at a future time.\n\nParticl Chosen to Present at the Toronto CryptoCamp Blockchain Unconference\nHome [https://www.cryptocamp.community/]\nToronto | 29.11.18 Crypto camp Get your tickets!\n[https://www.cryptocamp.community/]www.cryptocamp.community\n[https://www.cryptocamp.community/]\n\nParticl has been chosen among 80 applications to present its Particl Marketplace\nproduct at the Blockchain Unconference in Toronto on the 29th of November.\n\n> CryptoCamp is Toronto’s first-ever blockchain unconference. This\n100%-volunteer-led event aims to bring the entire blockchain community together,\nshowcase some of the most interesting products and projects, and pay it forward\nby offering Blockchain Bootcamp workshops. Organized by the community for the\ncommunity, CryptoCamp aims to grow, connect, and diversify the ecosystem. Come\nto meet other crypto-curious and crypto-scaredies, and connect with\nprofessionals working in this space. This event is for you.\nThis conference is mainly focused on two things: education, and the presentation\nof actual products making use of the blockchain technology. This event will be\nhosted at the Deloitte Office in Toronto and will take place over two entire\nfloors.\n\nThe first part of the day will be dedicated to education. In fact, many speakers\nwill give educational talks about crypto and blockchain technology in general to\na wide audience of crypto enthusiasts. The second part of the day, which is when\nwe are scheduled to present Particl Marketplace to the crowd, is focused on\nshowcasing actual blockchain products. In fact, a series of speakers will each\nbe demonstrating their blockchain products in front of experts in the field and\nexplain how they foresee it making an impact on the industry they’re each\ntargeting. With around 80 submitted applications or so, the event has chosen\nParticl as one of the projects it wants to see presented!\n\nTickets for the entire event are available at this link\n[https://www.eventbrite.com/e/crypto-camp-at-deloitte-tickets-51716842468#tickets]\n, and we hope to have the chance to meet some of you who live close to Toronto.\nThis event is organized in part by CryptoChicks, a rather well-known blockchain\ngroup in Canada, and has partnered with several key sponsors such as Deloitte,\nShyft, BlockGeeks, TWG, and many more to make it a memorable moment. If you’re\naround the area and would like to come, let us know in advance so that we can\nmeet up at some point!\n\nSee the full list of speakers here: https://www.cryptocamp.community/speakers/\n\nDevelopment Team Meeting in South Africa\nThe team is currently meeting near Elizabeth Port in South Africa for its\nquarterly meeting. This time, instead of solely focusing on development\nstrategy, the team has also invited most of the communications team to join the\nmeeting and further develop the marketplace launch strategy and communications\nstrategy moving forward. Topics to be discussed include the coming release of\nParticl Marketplace, the coming funding round, the internal development roadmap,\nand many other topics. We will keep you updated as we go, of course!\n\nAdditional Links\nBitcoinAfrica.io Interview with Desi-Rae\n[https://bitcoinafrica.io/2018/11/07/interview-cryptoramble-particl-project/]\n\nNodesOfValue Interview with CryptoBeans\n[https://nodesofvalue.com/particl-passive-income-from-staking-and-decentralized-market-listing-fees/]\n\nNew Desi-Rae Video:\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe wish you all a good week and don’t forget to follow our particl.news\n[http://particl.news] page to not miss any update and #BePART of our great \nDiscord [https://discord.gg/CQNZDN] community!\n\nThe Particl Team","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--11/1-VEFKKynh55H3sZAgvQbcFQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Did you miss our last AMA/FAQ livestream on Youtube?

Tecnovert is still working on some RingCT improvements on stability, performance, and security, and wants to complete those before releasing it on mainnet. He did start to officially work on the Bulletproofs implementation and so it is likely that it will hit mainnet WITH bulletproofs included.</p><h3 id=\"does-the-particl-team-plans-on-integrating-a-lock-up-time-for-part-coins-when-they-are-unlocked-for-staking-so-that-coins-are-locked-for-a-longer-time-and-can-t-be-moved-staked-sold-before-your-node-finds-a-block\">Does the Particl team plans on integrating a lock-up time for PART coins when they are unlocked for staking so that coins are locked for a longer time and can’t be moved/staked/sold before your node finds a block?</h3><p>In short, it is not an immediate issue we are targeting. While this might be a good idea, in theory, to make it more difficult for people to accumulate coins and then misuse them to attack the project by abusing the Proof-of-Stake protocol, such as measure would likely severely handicap Particl as a currency. This isn’t to say that a similar measure won’t ever be considered or implemented, after all, Particl is all about security, but right now the focus is mostly on Particl Marketplace and Particl Desktop. It’s important to note that we have a Research &#x26; Development team constantly putting up to test, researching, and evaluating the many solutions popping up all over the industry, meaning that our team is pro-actively putting your security at the highest priority.</p><p>One interesting dynamics related to this question specifically is how Particl Marketplace’s escrow mechanism, which is based on the MAD game-theory and requires double security deposits from both vendors and buyers, will actually lock some of the supply out of circulation. In fact, both vendors and buyers need to deposit funds into an escrow smart-contract to ensure both parties’ honesty. This, in turn, results in a portion of the supply being locked. Contrary to the proposed solution in this question, having some of the supply locked through the marketplace’s escrow is much more organic and less intrusive, as everyone who’s going to contribute to this “lock up” will do so in a perfectly voluntary basis, as opposed to being “forced” to lock some coins up for an extended period of time by the protocol. This is a scenario we believe to be more fair to the users and less handicapping. Additionally, in the future, more Dapps could make use of Particl’s decentralized escrow mechanism and lock even more supply out of circulation, especially once we release the developed SDK toolkit. This will make it considerably harder for attackers to acquire large sums of coins and misuse them against the network (although that behavior is akin to an “economic suicide” from the attacker’s standpoint).</p><h3 id=\"looking-at-recent-events-with-charlie-shrem-does-he-have-access-to-any-documentation-or-internal-chats\">Looking at recent events with Charlie Shrem, does he have access to any documentation or internal chats?</h3><p>No, none of our advisors have any access to internal chats and documents, except for Joe Fisher which has been heavily involved with Particl Marketplace lately (as per his experience as a career product inventor and online seller). All of Charlie’s communication with the team has been done through private messages. Like any other company that would have one of its advisors accused of some misbehavior, we’re adopting a wait and see approach to the situation, instead deciding to keep a close eye on the situation rather than proceed to hasty conclusions. Should Charlie Shrem be recognized guilty of the allegations made against him, we will have no choice but to distance ourselves from him and his brand. Until that point, we’re staying alert to the situation.</p><h3 id=\"will-particl-hire-a-market-maker-and-make-deals-with-bigger-exchanges-like-binance\">Will Particl hire a market maker and make deals with bigger exchanges like Binance?</h3><p>It seems that some representative from Binance may be hanging in our community and chatrooms as we get some pretty pointed questions from them from times to times regarding happenings, updates, and news we publish. While in reality, this may not mean anything, it is definitely a good thing for the industry in general that this exchange is keeping itself super diligent.

the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]Following last week's release\nof the MVP for multi-net capabilities using Simplex as the first alternative\nnetwork, we've identified several Simplex-specific issues that we're currently\nworking to resolve.\n\nDue to Simplex's complex and intricate network architecture, these issues are\nproving challenging to address, requiring additional development time.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]We're happy to announce that\nthe MVP for the new multi-net feature, which currently supports SimpleX\n[https://simplex.chat/], has now been published in a pull request earlier this\nweek. We're still testing it before pushing to the dev branch, and will document\nhow to test/use it in the coming few days.\n\nNote that this new feature is at the MVP stage, meaning it does not possess all\nthe bells and whistles we have planned for its official V1 version. Namely, it\nis currently not included in the GUI, it must be manually configured outside the\nuser interface by editing a config file, and it doesn't yet allow swaps to\nhappen when two participants are on a different network. \n\nThe latter will require modifications to the SMSG protocol via a hardfork, which\nwe are likely to bundle with a potential coming hardfork to tweak the network\nemission rate and disable treasury (more news about this treasury community CCS\nproposal to be published next week), should its ccs proposal be voted in favor.\n\nSo stay tuned if you want to test the new multi-net function in the coming days!\n\nMarket Making and Advanced Trading ?\nAMM by gerlofvanek · Pull Request #310 · basicswap/basicswapAdded full\nfunctional AMM web GUI in BSX.Added \"adjust_rates_based_on_market\"\n(Adjust rates based on existing market offers).- The control host/port should\nbe\nqueried from the basicswap....GitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/310]We've also implemented various\nimprovements to the automated market making functionality that we recently\nintegrated into the user interface (alpha version):\n\n * Added an auto-start option\n * Improved createoffers.py market making script\n * Updated the bid_xmr template confirm model\n * Fixed a bug with Create Default Configuration\n * Added a confirmation modal\n * Fixed adjust_rates_based_on_market\n * Removed debug and added extra logging\n * Fixed some math issue for calculating rates\n * Fixed Your Offers count when offers are created via the AMM\n * Better overall redirects\n * Added USD prices\n * Add all, minrate, and static options\n * Add offers/bids checkbox enabled always checked\n * Set the amount step default to 0.001\n * Various fixes/bugs/styling\n\nAt this time, we're still improving the integration and adding new, useful\nfeatures for liquidity providers to gain better control of their trading\noperations.\n\nThese include the following:\n\nOur upcoming improvements include:\n\n 1. Automatic offer management: Automatically revoke an AMM offer after each\n    successful bid, then repost the offer with an updated (stepped) amount;\n 2. Smart bid placement: Attempt to place bids that fill your offers at your\n    desired rate, then place an AMM offer for the remainder at that same rate;\n 3. Auto-accept filtering: Enable interaction only with offers that are\n    configured to automatically accept bids.\n\nThese three features will create a user experience that more closely resembles\ntraditional exchanges, which will integrate seamlessly with our upcoming \"Quick\nSwaps\" page and advanced order book display.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, we thank you immensely for your passion and dedication to Particl and\nwhat it's working towards achieving.
