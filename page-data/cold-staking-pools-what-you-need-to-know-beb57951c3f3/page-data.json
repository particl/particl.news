All rewards\nearned while staking from a pool are sent over to the pool operator, which then\nexecutes payouts proportional to how much you’ve contributed to the total amount\nof rewards the pool earned. This is particularly useful if you own fewer coins\nand still want to stake your coins as it means you’ll earn more frequent, but\nsmaller, staking rewards.\n\nCold Staking Pools\ntecnovert/particl-coldstakepool\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool]\nPooled coldstaking demo. Contribute to tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool\ndevelopment by creating an account on GitHub.\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool]github.com\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool]\n\nThe reason Particl’s staking pools are called cold staking pools is that they\noperate in the same way cold staking does. Cold staking allows you to delegate\nyour staking powers to a cold staking node which can then stake on your behalf,\nbut without being able to spend your coins. In other words, cold staking allows\nyou to stake coins stored offline without giving the node operator access to\nyour coins (usually, the operator is the same user as the coins being staked,\nalthough not obligatory).\n\nIn that sense, cold staking pools are like special cold staking nodes that\nallows the pool operator to spend staking rewards on your behalf, but not your\ncoins. This distinction between staking pools and cold staking pools is\nimportant because the latter is much more secure. Because the pool doesn’t\nactually hold any coin other than a few hours worth of staking rewards, there is\nactually very little to steal for a hacker as the entirety of the staking weight\npossessed by the cold staking pool isn’t even in their possession. Cold staking\npools keep you in full control of your own funds at all time!\n\nNote: You can get the full benefits of the world’s most secure Proof-of-Stake\nprotocol by combining cold staking or cold staking pools to the security of a\nLedger Nano S hardware device. This will make your funds impossible to steal\neven when unlocking your wallet from an infected or compromised computer. To\nlearn more about this, read the “The Ultimate Vulnerability” section of this\nblog post\n[https://particl.news/particl-introduces-hardware-cold-staking-daa093d124ae]. To\nlearn how to connect your funds stored on a Ledger Nano S hardware device to a\nstaking pool, follow the instructions in this tutorial\n[https://particl.news/particl-ledger-video-tutorial-setup-cold-staking-2cd5628fecac] \nand, instead of using a cold staking node public key, use the public key given\nto you by the cold staking pool.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow Are Cold Staking Pools Going to Benefit the Particl Network?\nIn short, it’s going to make staking much more accessible and practical to\neveryone, regardless of the number of coins you hold or your level of expertise.\n\nStaking With Fewer Coins\nIn fact, staking with only a small PART balance is not ideal because of the size\nof each staking reward (~1.25 PART at the time of this writing). To put that in\nperspective, consider the moment 1 PART was worth around $50. If you wanted to\nbuy $1,000 worth of Particl, that would have given you around 20 PART. Back\nthen, the staking interest rate was 5%. This meant that, after one full year of\nstaking, you would have earned around 1 PART staking on the network, a yearly\nreward that is smaller than the payout size. In other words, chances are high\nthat you wouldn’t even have received a single reward during the entire year even\nthough you helped secure the network the whole time. This phenomenon is not\nunlike “solo mining” with a poor GPU on Proof-of-Work networks.\n\nNow, with cold staking pools, you could “team up” with the other stakers\nconnected to the same pool as you and get a share of the staking rewards earned\nby the pool proportional to how much you’ve contributed to it. Instead of\nwaiting a long time to receive one large staking reward, you would receive\nsmaller but more frequent rewards. This makes staking much more interesting and\ninteractive, and also makes staking with fewer coins more stable and reliable.\n\nEasier to Set Up for Non-Technical Users\nAnother obstacle to cold staking is the technical level required to set up a\ncold staking node. Although not overly complicated, especially when following \nthe cold staking node setup tutorial\n[https://particl.news/guide-setting-up-particl-cold-staking-f5d9073bac4], it\ndoes require time and effort to correctly execute. It also generally requires\nthe use of a staking device like a Raspberry Pi or a VPS server, all of which\nadds up to the difficulty and hassle of setting cold staking up.\n\nOn top of that, staking devices need to be maintained quite regularly: you need\nto make sure it is up 24/7, you need to ideally keep it updated to the latest\nParticl Core version (especially when there are hardforks), and you need to make\nsure it is properly restarted when, for example, there is a power outage or\nsomething that makes the electricity go off.\n\nFor a lot of users, especially the less technical ones, the dedication it takes\nto set cold staking up and maintain its device is simply too much. Cold staking\npools, on the other hand, do not require you to prepare and manage a staking\nnode since that part is taken care of by the pool operator. Enabling cold\nstaking has never been as easy as with cold staking pools, and it shouldn’t take\nmore than 2 minutes off of your time!\n\nMore Coins Being Staked\nBecause of how much it would benefit some types of users, cold staking pools are\nlikely to encourage more people to stake their coins. This will benefit the\nnetwork by having fewer available coins on the markets, meaning it would be much\nharder for an attacker to acquire large sums of PART coins and try to damage the\nnetwork with a 51% attack. In Proof-of-Stake networks, more coins being put up\nfor staking means it is more secure.\n\nNote: Staking pools do present a risk to the network if misused. In fact, while\nthey make 51% attacks harder to execute by reducing the number of coins\navailable on the markets, they could also potentially end up staking 51% of the\ntotal network supply if users are not careful enough. As such, we encourage as\nmany people within the community to come up with their own cold staking pools\n(the source code is openly available here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool]) in order to create many\ndifferent options for users which would lead to a better decentralization of the\nstaking supply.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQuick Facts\n * You can still vote on Community Proposals and flag listings while your funds\n   are connected to a cold staking pool.\n * The pool operator cannot vote on your behalf, nor can he flag listings using\n   your coin weight.\n * Records can be obtained to verify the pool’s operator integrity.\n * Payout threshold (the total amount of PART you need to accumulate within the\n   pool before a payout is executed) is set up by the pool operator and can be\n   changed at any time.\n * In the future, pools might be able to read specially formatted control\n   transactions, meaning smart-contracts could potentially interact with them.\n * In the future, research might be done to integrate the Lightning Network to\n   cold staking pools, which would allow an almost infinite number of\n   micro-payouts per day (i.e. multiple payouts throughout the day of 0.01\n   PART). This may or may not happen depending on the need and feasibility of\n   such a feature.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started Today!\nConnect to a staking pool today and start reaping its benefits in less than 2\nminutes!

Cold staking allows you to delegate your staking powers to a cold staking node which can then stake on your behalf, but without being able to spend your coins. In other words, cold staking allows you to stake coins stored offline without giving the node operator access to your coins (usually, the operator is the same user as the coins being staked, although not obligatory).</p><p>In that sense, cold staking pools are like special cold staking nodes that allows the pool operator to spend staking rewards on your behalf, but not your coins. This distinction between staking pools and cold staking pools is important because the latter is much more secure. Because the pool doesn’t actually hold any coin other than a few hours worth of staking rewards, there is actually very little to steal for a hacker as the entirety of the staking weight possessed by the cold staking pool isn’t even in their possession. <strong>Cold staking pools keep you in full control of your own funds at all time!</strong></p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><em> You can get the full benefits of the world’s most secure Proof-of-Stake protocol by combining cold staking or cold staking pools to the security of a Ledger Nano S hardware device. This will make your funds impossible to steal even when unlocking your wallet from an infected or compromised computer.

To put that in perspective, consider the moment 1 PART was worth around $50. If you wanted to buy $1,000 worth of Particl, that would have given you around 20 PART. Back then, the staking interest rate was 5%. This meant that, after one full year of staking, you would have earned around 1 PART staking on the network, a yearly reward that is smaller than the payout size. In other words, chances are high that you wouldn’t even have received a single reward during the entire year even though you helped secure the network the whole time. This phenomenon is not unlike “solo mining” with a poor GPU on Proof-of-Work networks.</p><p>Now, with cold staking pools, you could “team up” with the other stakers connected to the same pool as you and get a share of the staking rewards earned by the pool proportional to how much you’ve contributed to it. Instead of waiting a long time to receive one large staking reward, you would receive smaller but more frequent rewards. This makes staking much more interesting and interactive, and also <strong>makes</strong> <strong>staking with fewer coins more stable and reliable</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"easier-to-set-up-for-non-technical-users\">Easier to Set Up for Non-Technical Users</h3><p>Another obstacle to cold staking is the technical level required to set up a cold staking node. Although not overly complicated, especially when following <a href=\"https://particl.news/guide-setting-up-particl-cold-staking-f5d9073bac4\"><strong>the cold staking node setup tutorial</strong></a>, it does require time and effort to correctly execute. It also generally requires the use of a staking device like a Raspberry Pi or a VPS server, all of which adds up to the difficulty and hassle of setting cold staking up.</p><p>On top of that, staking devices need to be maintained quite regularly: you need to make sure it is up 24/7, you need to ideally keep it updated to the latest Particl Core version (especially when there are hardforks), and you need to make sure it is properly restarted when, for example, there is a power outage or something that makes the electricity go off.</p><p>For a lot of users, especially the less technical ones, the dedication it takes to set cold staking up and maintain its device is simply too much. Cold staking pools, on the other hand, do not require you to prepare and manage a staking node since that part is taken care of by the pool operator. <strong>Enabling cold staking has never been as easy as with cold staking pools, and it shouldn’t take more than 2 minutes off of your time</strong>!</p><h3 id=\"more-coins-being-staked\">More Coins Being Staked</h3><p>Because of how much it would benefit some types of users, cold staking pools are likely to encourage more people to stake their coins. This will benefit the network by having fewer available coins on the markets, meaning it would be much harder for an attacker to acquire large sums of PART coins and try to damage the network with a 51% attack. In Proof-of-Stake networks, more coins being put up for staking means it is more secure.</p><p><em><strong>Note: </strong></em><em>Staking pools do present a risk to the network if misused. In fact, while they make 51% attacks harder to execute by reducing the number of coins available on the markets, they could also potentially end up staking 51% of the total network supply if users are not careful enough. As such, we encourage as many people within the community to come up with their own cold staking pools (the source code is </em><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-coldstakepool\"><em><strong>openly available here</strong></em></a><em>) in order to create many different options for users which would lead to a better decentralization of the staking supply.</em></p><hr><h2 id=\"quick-facts\">Quick Facts</h2><ul><li><strong>You can still vote</strong> on Community Proposals and flag listings while your funds are connected to a cold staking pool.</li><li>The <strong>pool operator cannot vote on your behalf, nor can he flag listings </strong>using your coin weight.</li><li>Records can be obtained to verify the pool’s operator <strong>integrity</strong>.</li><li>Payout threshold (the total amount of PART you need to accumulate within the pool before a payout is executed) is set up by the pool operator and can be changed at any time.</li><li>In the future, pools might be able to read specially formatted control transactions, <strong>meaning smart-contracts could potentially interact with them.</strong></li><li>In the future, research might be done to integrate the <strong>Lightning Network</strong> to cold staking pools, which would allow an <strong>almost infinite number of micro-payouts per day</strong> (i.e. multiple payouts throughout the day of 0.01 PART).

There is a very simple reason behind it: it’s one of the first\ntime people can actually gain full control over their own money and transact\nwith anyone in the world without requiring the assistance or oversight of any\nthird-party or authority figure. In other words, Bitcoin gives us, the people,\nfinancial and economic freedom like never before.\n\nAs great as it sounds, Bitcoin is still unfortunately pretty dependent on\ncentralized infrastructure, and thus, is having a hard time realizing its\nvision. When you think about it, the moment you want to spend your coins, what\ndo you do? Maybe you transfer them to an exchange, trade them against fiat\ncurrencies, make a withdraw into your bank account, and then, finally, visit an\neCommerce platform to make a purchase. Or maybe you have found some service\ncompany that will accept your coins and buy products on the web on your behalf.\nThat is, in both cases, quite costly in terms of fees, time spent navigating\nthrough all these hoops and, most importantly, still pretty much centralized.\nNot only does this practice goes against everything Bitcoin was created for,\nnamely the vision of a new economy, one that is independent of centralized\nauthorities and third-parties, but it also makes Bitcoin’s adoption as a\ncurrency a dud.\n\nSo how do we fix that problem? How can we fill the gap to adoption and place the\nfinal piece of the puzzle, so to speak? How can we get to the point where we\nwon’t have to exit crypto anymore because spending Bitcoin and other coins will\nbe easier than switching back to the old global fiat economy?\n\nBitcoin’s Missing Piece to its Grand Puzzle\nBitcoin is almost everything a currency should be, but there appears to be\nsomething missing for a true crypto-based economy to flourish and thrive. Of\ncourse, some merchants do accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly and\nwithout intermediary, but they are few and far in between and usually difficult\nto find within all the noise. Because most people value convenience so much,\nthey would rather spend more money and “exit” the crypto ecosystem rather than\ngoing through the hassle of finding these vendors.\n\nThe end result is that, as it stands today, Bitcoin is used for mostly three\nthings: trading/speculation, remittance payments, and store of value. It is\ncertainly debatable how much it is used for actual spending, but one thing is\ncertain: spending Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for products and services\nis, at the moment, considerably more of a hassle than simply using fiat\ncurrencies. This makes cryptocurrencies simply unattractive to most people\noutside the relatively small cryptocurrency community and is one of the main\nreasons it is still not recognized as a serious currency.\n\nWhen we, cryptocurrency enthusiasts, dream about mainstream adoption, we have to\nfirst recognize the challenges we still face to this day. Without Bitcoin and\nother cryptocurrencies being at least as easily, affordably, and conveniently\nspendable as traditional currencies, the cryptocurrency ecosystem is likely to\nremain stuck within its own bubble. The path to mainstream adoption of the\nBitcoin decentralized currency and the independent economy it seeks to create\ncannot rely on the centralized infrastructure of the old global fiat economy.\n\n> The path to mainstream adoption of the Bitcoin decentralized currency and the\nindependent economy it seeks to create cannot rely on the centralized\ninfrastructure of the old global fiat economy.\nWith the Bitcoin cryptocurrency ecosystem and community quickly growing within\nthe last few years, it seems the final roadblock in the path to mainstream\nadoption and the realization of crypto as a truly independent economy is the\nability to be able to easily spend coins without third-party and have it be as\nconvenient and affordable as it would be when spending traditional currencies\nwithin the global fiat economy.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Day Has Come for Crypto to Claim its Independence\nUp until now, and even after all these years, there hasn’t been any clear\nsolution to the issue of not being able to spend Bitcoin and other\ncryptocurrencies with the same freedom and convenience you can transact them.\nMany companies and websites have tried to claim they were allowing people to\neasily spend their coins, but in the end, it always required you to trust that\nentity and pay fees on top of it. Far from ideal!\n\nThere is, however, a project presenting itself as a solid and completely\ntrustless solution to the now decade-old coin spending problem, and could very\nwell help Bitcoin’s adoption as an actual currency. Let’s dive right into what\nmakes this project such a good candidate to be that missing piece of the\nBitcoin’s puzzle.\n\nParticl’s Open Marketplace\nBuilt on the most recent Bitcoin codebase, Particl’s Open Marketplace is a\ndecentralized, fully trustless marketplace specifically designed to work with\nyour favorite cryptocurrency. Imagine a platform similar to eBay, but with no\nintermediary whatsoever, the possibility to use your favorite coin (including\nBitcoin), built with privacy at its core, and with barely any fee. All the good\nstuff from eBay…without the bad stuff! Too good to be true? Absolutely not!\n\nThe absence of any intermediary, just like Bitcoin, allows the Open Marketplace\nto run very effectively without any bias and at a bare minimal cost. The\nbuilt-in privacy features included with the Particl network (RingCT on Bitcoin\ncodebase) and the lack of any sort of data mining also insures that no party,\nsuch as a platform operator or payment processor, can access your personal\ninformation. The only data ever shared with another party is your shipping\naddress to the vendors you’re buying products from.\n\nBuilt on the Bitcoin Codebase\nParticl Open Marketplace is built on the latest Bitcoin codebase, meaning it has\nall the latest features brought forth by the most recent updates to Bitcoin,\nincluding a default integration of Segwit, Lightning Network\n[http://lightning.network]-readiness, as well as being compatible with most of\nthe Bitcoin products out there (i.e. Bitpay’s Copay Bitcoin mobile wallet is\nnamed Particl Copay on the Particl blockchain).\n\nIt is important to note, however, that Particl is not an ICO, not an\nEthereum-token, and runs its very own blockchain in order to have full control\nover its ecosystem. The blockchain was launched in a very fair way years ago and\nis developed by a team of mostly Bitcoin fanatics [http://particl.io/about-us] \nthat have been working in crypto for quite some time and have made names for\nthemselves. Particl’s Github page [http://github.com/particl] is one of the most\nactive one in the entire blockchain industry, and the amount of work being done\non it is tremendous, especially in comparison to other cryptocurrency projects,\nalways ranking in among the top coins in Darpal’s Github Audit Reports\n[https://medium.com/@DPRating].\n\nUse Your Favorite Coin\nStraying away from the counter-productive “tribalism” currently plaguing the\ncrypto industry, Particl Open Marketplace’s underlying protocol is designed to\nwork with your favorite cryptocurrency. While initial versions of the\nmarketplace might only work with PART to begin with, it has been coded in such a\nway that integrating almost any coin to its platform is made trivial. Of course,\nBitcoin is planned to be the first coin introduced to the platform.\n\nTribalism, or the bad habit many people in the crypto industry adopt when\nfighting over “who has the best coin or platform”, is not a philosophy endorsed\nby the Particl team. Contrary to many ICOs and “new” blockchain projects, \nParticl is free for almost any crypto community to use and does not discriminate\nin favor of its native currency. Forcing users to use a native currency is a\nmistake we see way too often now in the industry and a gimmick that is highly\nunappealing to most people. Particl’s Open Marketplace is designed to benefit\nthe entire crypto ecosystem and add utility to all coins!\n\nPrivate-by-Design\nUsing some of the latest privacy technologies in the industry, the Open\nMarketplace is private-by-design, meaning that all purchases and sales made from\nwithin its platform are private by default, regardless of the coin used to make\nthe purchase.\n\nIn fact, Particl has been the first project to integrate RingCT, the privacy\nprotocol made popular by Monero, on the Bitcoin codebase (or any other codebase\nother than Cryptonote, for that matter). Moreover, the entire platform is built\nwith privacy at its core, meaning no data can ever leak out of the platform or\nbe recorded in a publicly auditable fashion on the blockchain, protecting its\nusers from abusive data analysis and industry copycats. Content is stripped of\nall its metadata (i.e. listing pictures) and every aspect of the marketplace is\ndesigned to make transactions and user identities indistinguishable.\nAdditionally, you can start your own private market (currently called “bubbles”)\nand make products available only to those who you send the access key to, making\nthe entire process even more private and completely away from the eyes of\ncompetitors.\n\nRidiculously Low Fees\nParticl’s Initial Fee Schedule (Will Decrease Over Time)What would be the use of\nsuch a marketplace if fees were high? The whole point of this article was to, in\npart, point out how expensive shopping with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies\ncan get because you are forced to use third-parties which, among the many\ndisadvantages they cause, charge users with fees that make spending coins not a\ncost-effective activity. For the crypto economy to really become a viable\noption, fees need to be kept at a minimum, which is exactly the case on\nParticl’s Open Marketplace.\n\nWhile Particl is already very low on fees at this current moment in time, it\nwill ultimately reach its vision and be fully integrated with both scalable and\nentirely trustless solutions which will make it a near-zero fee platform.\nProtocols such as atomic swaps\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atomic-swaps.asp] (already live on mainnet\nsince October 2017), Lightning Network [http://lightning.network], Segwit, and\nothers will make using Particl extremely affordable and as convenient and fast\nas traditional eCommerce platforms.\n\nGenerally speaking, charging vendors with barely any fee, especially when they\nare used to be being abused by traditional platforms, means they will be able to\neither make more profit-per-sale or lower their prices to gain an advantage over\ntheir competitors and get bigger sales volume. The end result for the customer\nis likely to be more affordable products than anywhere else on the web. Fees on\ntraditional eCommerce platforms are outrageous, the new crypto economy is a fair\none that is centered around its users, not the platform’s operator!\n\nNo Intermediary At All\nNo, you are not dreaming. All of this is indeed available without the use of any\nthird-party or central authority whatsoever. Every feature available on the Open\nMarketplace comes from 100% trustless protocols. For example, atomic swaps is\nthe protocol used to enable you to use your favorite coin. The escrow is managed\nthrough a mechanism using a smart-contract and security deposits and is based on\nthe MAD game-theory. The governance (or moderation) of the marketplace’s content\nis entirely controlled by the community.\n\nThere is absolutely no intermediary on Particl, just like there is no\nintermediary involved when transacting Bitcoin from person-to-person. In other\nwords, everything that Bitcoin has which made its cryptocurrency great, Particl\noffers the same but to the eCommerce industry. No intermediary means anything\nyou do within the platform is perfectly secure and untraceable, that your data\nisn’t collected or shared with anyone, and that the platform can be used at a\nbare minimal cost.\n\nAs mentioned earlier in this article, the path to mainstream adoption of the\nBitcoin decentralized currency and the independent economy it seeks to create\ncannot rely on the centralized infrastructure of the old global fiat economy.\n\nEarn Cryptocurrencies While You Sleep\nAnother important aspect of an “economy” is to be able to earn transferable\nvalue (currency) directly within it. This is precisely what Particl makes\npossible.\n\nIn fact, not only can you sell products and services online to earn\ncryptocurrencies without requiring any intermediary, but you also receive the\nentirety of the fees generated by the Particl platform as a coin holder. This\naspect of the platform constitutes a great source of passive income and is\nexpected to get exponentially profitable as the marketplace sees more sales\nvolume per day. This passive income mechanism also applies to all future paid\n(but optional) features of the marketplace such as featured listing spots, for\nexample.\n\nThe Power of Community\nWith Particl’s Open Marketplace, you can expect convenience like never seen\nbefore when looking for vendors that accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nBecause Particl presents itself as a common ground for both vendors and buyers,\nit makes it very easy to find the product or service you are looking for or to\nget the exposure you deserve as a vendor accepting crypto. Looking for\nsomething? Just type what you wish to purchase in the search bar, and be exposed\nto a multitude of vendors selling what you need. Selling stuff? Just list your\nproducts on the Open Marketplace and instantly get the exposure you deserve in\nfront of the right target audience. Gone are the days spent digging through\nsearch engines and advertising your business on obscure cryptocurrency forums,\nthe world is now at your fingertips and is available at minimum effort!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Building Blocks of the New Economy\nBitcoin and Particl’s Open Marketplace are entirely complementary and made to\nlive side-by-side. If we were to compare the new, independent economy made\npossible by Bitcoin and Particl to a house, Bitcoin would be its cornerstone (or\nits foundation) while Particl would the support beams. Bitcoin is what started\nit all (the cornerstone), but without its support beams, the house would not be\nable to stand ground for much longer, let alone withstand severe storms of FUD\nand speculation-led bear markets.\n\nBe Part of the Solution\nThe mainnet release of Particl Open Marketplace is rapidly approaching, and the\ndays where Bitcoin was stuck within its own bubble caused by the inconvenience\nof spending coins are now coming to an end. With a super convenient, affordable,\neye-candy, and trustless solution to spend coins about to see the day, now is\nthe time to get involved!\n\nParticl Open Marketplace is currently undergoing heavy testing on public testnet\nand is nearing its Beta release, and we need you now more than ever! Come to\njoin our community, connect with other pioneers of the new, independent economy,\nand spread the word around. We now stand at the forefront of one of the biggest\nfinancial revolution to ever see the day: the birth of the first truly global\nand independent economy powered by Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies!","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Bitcoin---Particl--Building-an-Independent-Economy-Together/1-LejDfDLZGzsWcTxixmLHzA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>Bitcoin is often considered the most important technological breakthrough since the internet.

When you think about it, the moment you want to spend your coins, what do you do? Maybe you transfer them to an exchange, trade them against fiat currencies, make a withdraw into your bank account, and then, finally, visit an eCommerce platform to make a purchase. Or maybe you have found some service company that will accept your coins and buy products on the web on your behalf. That is, in both cases, quite costly in terms of fees, time spent navigating through all these hoops and, most importantly, still pretty much centralized.

Of course, some merchants do accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly and without intermediary, but they are few and far in between and usually difficult to find within all the noise.

Many companies and websites have tried to claim they were allowing people to easily spend their coins, but in the end, it always required you to trust that entity and pay fees on top of it. Far from ideal!</p><p>There is, however, a project presenting itself as a solid and completely trustless solution to the now decade-old coin spending problem, and could very well help Bitcoin’s adoption as an actual currency. Let’s dive right into what makes this project such a good candidate to be that missing piece of the Bitcoin’s puzzle.</p><h3 id=\"particl-s-open-marketplace\">Particl’s Open Marketplace</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Bitcoin---Particl--Building-an-Independent-Economy-Together/1-ic2Ys6LH0rRcc9IiHUJ-XA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Built on the most recent Bitcoin codebase, Particl’s Open Marketplace is a decentralized, fully trustless marketplace specifically designed to work with your favorite cryptocurrency. Imagine a platform similar to eBay, but with <strong>no intermediary</strong> whatsoever, the <strong>possibility to use your favorite coin</strong> (including Bitcoin), <strong>built with privacy at its core</strong>, and <strong>with barely any fee</strong>. All the good stuff from eBay…without the bad stuff! Too good to be true? Absolutely not!</p><p>The absence of any intermediary, just like Bitcoin, allows the Open Marketplace to run very effectively without any bias and at a bare minimal cost. The built-in privacy features included with the Particl network (RingCT on Bitcoin codebase) and the lack of any sort of data mining also insures that <strong>no party</strong>, such as a platform operator or payment processor, <strong>can access your personal information</strong>. The only data ever shared with another party is your shipping address to the vendors you’re buying products from.</p><h3 id=\"built-on-the-bitcoin-codebase\"><strong>Built on the Bitcoin Codebase</strong></h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Bitcoin---Particl--Building-an-Independent-Economy-Together/1-t2vpHIAhhHL09kj6CLmGjg.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Particl Open Marketplace is built on the latest Bitcoin codebase, meaning it has all the latest features brought forth by the most recent updates to Bitcoin, including a default integration of Segwit, <a href=\"http://lightning.network\"><strong>Lightning Network</strong></a>-readiness, as well as being compatible with most of the Bitcoin products out there (i.e. Bitpay’s Copay Bitcoin mobile wallet is named Particl Copay on the Particl blockchain).</p><p>It is important to note, however, that Particl is <strong>not an ICO</strong>, <strong>not an Ethereum-token</strong>, and runs its very own blockchain in order to have full control over its ecosystem. The blockchain was launched in a very fair way years ago and is <a href=\"http://particl.io/about-us\"><strong>developed by a team of mostly Bitcoin fanatics</strong></a><strong> </strong>that have been working in crypto for quite some time and have made names for themselves. <a href=\"http://github.com/particl\"><strong>Particl’s Github page</strong></a> is one of the most active one in the entire blockchain industry, and the amount of work being done on it is tremendous, especially in comparison to other cryptocurrency projects, always ranking in among the top coins in <a href=\"https://medium.com/@DPRating\"><strong>Darpal’s Github Audit Reports</strong></a>.</p><h3 id=\"use-your-favorite-coin\"><strong>Use Your Favorite Coin</strong></h3><p>Straying away from the counter-productive “tribalism” currently plaguing the crypto industry, Particl Open Marketplace’s underlying protocol is <strong>designed to work with your favorite cryptocurrency</strong>. While initial versions of the marketplace might only work with PART to begin with, it has been coded in such a way that integrating almost any coin to its platform is made trivial. Of course, Bitcoin is planned to be the first coin introduced to the platform.</p><p>Tribalism, or the bad habit many people in the crypto industry adopt when fighting over “who has the best coin or platform”, is not a philosophy endorsed by the Particl team. Contrary to many ICOs and “new” blockchain projects, <strong>Particl is free for almost any crypto community to use and does not discriminate in favor of its native currency</strong>. Forcing users to use a native currency is a mistake we see way too often now in the industry and a gimmick that is highly unappealing to most people. Particl’s Open Marketplace is designed to benefit the entire crypto ecosystem and add utility to all coins!</p><h3 id=\"private-by-design\"><strong>Private-by-Design</strong></h3><p>Using some of the latest privacy technologies in the industry, the Open Marketplace is private-by-design, meaning that <strong>all purchases and sales made from within its platform are private by default</strong>, regardless of the coin used to make the purchase.</p><p>In fact, Particl has been the <strong>first project </strong>to integrate <strong>RingCT</strong>, the privacy protocol made popular by Monero, on the Bitcoin codebase (or any other codebase other than Cryptonote, for that matter). Moreover, the entire platform is built with privacy at its core, meaning <strong>no data can ever leak out of the platform</strong> or be recorded in a publicly auditable fashion on the blockchain, protecting its users from abusive data analysis and industry copycats. Content is stripped of all its metadata (i.e. listing pictures) and every aspect of the marketplace is designed to make transactions and user identities indistinguishable. Additionally, you can start your own private market (currently called “bubbles”) and make products available only to those who you send the access key to, making the entire process even more private and completely away from the eyes of competitors.</p><h3 id=\"ridiculously-low-fees\"><strong>Ridiculously Low Fees</strong></h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Bitcoin---Particl--Building-an-Independent-Economy-Together/1-ro6GHoRZk1JIctiO64ac9Q.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Particl’s Initial Fee Schedule (Will Decrease Over Time)</figcaption></figure><p>What would be the use of such a marketplace if fees were high? The whole point of this article was to, in part, point out how expensive shopping with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can get because you are forced to use third-parties which, among the many disadvantages they cause, charge users with fees that make spending coins not a cost-effective activity. For the crypto economy to really become a viable option, fees need to be kept at a minimum, which is exactly the case on Particl’s Open Marketplace.</p><p>While Particl is already <strong>very low on fees</strong> at this current moment in time, it will ultimately reach its vision and be fully integrated with both scalable and entirely trustless solutions which <strong>will make it a near-zero fee platform</strong>. Protocols such as <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atomic-swaps.asp\"><strong>atomic swaps</strong></a> (already live on mainnet since October 2017), <a href=\"http://lightning.network\"><strong>Lightning Network</strong></a>, Segwit, and others will make using Particl extremely affordable and as convenient and fast as traditional eCommerce platforms.</p><p>Generally speaking, charging vendors with barely any fee, especially when they are used to be being abused by traditional platforms, means they will be able to either make more profit-per-sale or lower their prices to gain an advantage over their competitors and get bigger sales volume. The end result for the customer is likely to be more affordable products than anywhere else on the web. Fees on traditional eCommerce platforms are outrageous, the new crypto economy is a fair one that is centered around its users, not the platform’s operator!</p><h3 id=\"no-intermediary-at-all\"><strong>No Intermediary At All</strong></h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Bitcoin---Particl--Building-an-Independent-Economy-Together/1-o2H8JUZgcWaZkbjIHVRB9w.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>No, you are not dreaming. All of this is indeed available without the use of any third-party or central authority whatsoever. Every feature available on the Open Marketplace comes from <strong>100% trustless</strong> protocols. For example, atomic swaps is the protocol used to enable you to use your favorite coin. The escrow is managed through a mechanism using a smart-contract and security deposits and is based on the MAD game-theory. The governance (or moderation) of the marketplace’s content is entirely controlled by the community.</p><p><strong>There is absolutely no intermediary on Particl</strong>, just like there is no intermediary involved when transacting Bitcoin from person-to-person. In other words, everything that Bitcoin has which made its cryptocurrency great, Particl offers the same but to the eCommerce industry. No intermediary means anything you do within the platform is perfectly secure and untraceable, that your data isn’t collected or shared with anyone, and that the platform can be used at a bare minimal cost.</p><p>As mentioned earlier in this article, the path to mainstream adoption of the Bitcoin decentralized currency and the independent economy it seeks to create cannot rely on the centralized infrastructure of the old global fiat economy.</p><h3 id=\"earn-cryptocurrencies-while-you-sleep\"><strong>Earn Cryptocurrencies While You Sleep</strong></h3><p>Another important aspect of an “economy” is to be able to earn transferable value (currency) directly within it.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
