However, they\nnecessitate that both cryptocurrencies involved in the exchange have\nprogrammable outputs, among other requirements. This swap type is available for\na wide array of coins, but not for Monero.\n\nAs the most commonly used 'privacy coin' today, Monero is particularly important\nfor BasicSwap’s goals, and boasts an extensive anonymity pool and high levels of\nfinancial privacy. This reinforces its impressive potential as an ideal digital\ncash form, but the concerted efforts in restraining its use by anti-freedom\nactors highlight the need for a counterparty-free trading solution.\n\nThat’s why Monero contributor, Joel Gugger — also known as H4sh3d — proposed a\nnew Monero-compatible atomic swap protocol based on adaptor signatures\n[https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126.pdf]. This breakthrough development, a\nproduct of the collaborative efforts of open-source developers over years,\nfinally opened the door to the facilitation of atomic swapping of Monero without\nthe need for programmable outputs.\n\n> Note: For a more in-depth look into the history of atomic swaps, check out our\nrecent blog post on the topic here\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before/]\n.\nThe Big Caveat to Monero Atomic Swaps\nWhile the advent of Monero atomic swaps using adaptor signatures represented a\nsignificant advancement, it came with a notable limitation: they could only\noperate in one direction. To clarify this, it's crucial to realize that in an\natomic swap, the roles of the participants are distinct: there's an 'offerer'\nand a 'bidder' (or ‘taker’).\n\nThe offerer creates a swap request — for BasicSwap, this means listing a swap\nrequest, often referred to as an 'offer', on the DEX's order book. The bidder,\nin contrast, reviews the terms of the swap request (the 'offer') and, upon\nagreement, initiates the swap process.\n\nThe offerer dictates the swap's parameters, including the offered and requested\ncoins, their respective quantities, and the exchange rate. While there are other\nparameters to set, such as the lock contract expiry time for example, they are\nnot specifically pertinent to this article's context.\n\nBasicSwap DEX's order bookDue to the technological foundation of semi-scriptless\natomic swaps, the offered coin must possess scriptable outputs, or more\naccurately, some form of malleability fix, often implemented as Segwit. This\nstipulation presents an improvement on HTLC swaps, which require programmable\noutputs for both coins, but in either cases, this prevents Monero from being\noffered in exchange for other coins, due to its lack of scriptable outputs.\n\nTo better understand this unidirectionality, consider this flow chart which\ndescribes a typical adaptor signature based atomic swap involving Monero, from\nthe perspective of the 'offerer'.\n\nSee flowchart from the bidder's perspective: \nhttps://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.bidder.alt.xu.min.svg\nNote that this does not imply that a Monero holder cannot swap it for Bitcoin —\na Bitcoin holder could create an offer to exchange Bitcoin for Monero, which the\nMonero user could then accept and initiate a swap. However, it does mean a\nMonero holder cannot be the one to create the offer. In other words, if you hold\nMonero and want Bitcoin, you must accept an offer created by someone else\nrequesting Monero for Bitcoin. If you hold Bitcoin and want Monero, then you\nmust create an offer offering Bitcoin for Monero.\n\nThis restriction considerably impacts the user experience in a negative way and\nadds complexity to the end user as it prevents them full access to the standard\nfunctionalities provided by atomic swaps and, more broadly, by centralized\ntrading exchanges. It also prevents Monero offerers from trading at the exact\nrate they want, as they are constrained to the rates of existing trade offers.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, we have devoted consistent effort to developing a\nsolution, with the goal of providing Monero users with the same advantages\nenjoyed by users of other coins on a DEX like BasicSwap.\n\nBidirectional Monero and Part (Anon) Swaps Are Here! ?\nWe are proud to announce that we’ve finally implemented bidirectional Monero\natomic swaps into BasicSwap mainnet, now available on the live beta and\naccessible for everyone! This breakthrough implies that the prior constraints on\nMonero users are no longer relevant, and that Monero users can now both request\nAND offer Monero when adding offers on BasicSwap's order book.\n\nHow was it Accomplished?\nMonero atomic swaps being solely a unidirectional process is a direct\nconsequence of Monero's robust codebase which offers limited scripting\ncapabilities, but enhanced resilience against different types of exploits.\n\nAs such, we achieved bidirectional swaps without altering the Monero codebase or\nmaking extensive changes to Joel Gugger’s adaptor signature-based Monero atomic\nswap protocol (beyond our previous enhancements to the protocol's privacy and\ntransaction size management, as detailed here\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements]\n).\n\nInstead, our strategy leveraged BasicSwap's strong suit — its use of the SMSG\nnetwork\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements] \nwith a focus on end user experience. After all, BasicSwap's primary goal as a\nDEX protocol is to simplify the process of atomic swaps and make it easy and\nmore accessible for people to transition away from centralized exchanges.\nTherefore, user experience is paramount and is what truly matters in our case.\n\nLeveraging the SMSG Network\nOn BasicSwap, the offerer creates a swap request or 'offer' on the DEX’s order\nbook, while participants (aka 'bidders') take a look at the order book, locate\nan offer that interests them, and initiate a swap. This process mirrors the\nmaker-taker system of traditional centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nHowever, this user experience isn't inherently part of atomic swap technology,\nas we've outlined in this blog post\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before]\n, but is facilitated by Particl's unique SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a\ndecentralized, privacy-first messaging network, also known as 'mixnets' (see \nthis article\n[https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements] \nfor more information on SMSG).\n\nThe SMSG network serves as a powerful tool and a crucial component in making\nBasicSwap DEX a user-centric platform. Turns out, it also ultimately became the\nkey to implementing bidirectional Monero atomic swaps.\n\nSimulating Offers Requesting Monero\nOur solution to the unidirectionality of Monero atomic swaps doesn't hinge on\nmodifying the Monero codebase or its adaptor signature atomic swap protocol.\nInstead, it leverages the SMSG network to simulate offers featuring Monero.\n\nIn reality, BasicSwap still employs the same semi-scriptless adaptor signature\nprotocol. Hence, at the protocol level, the swaps remain unidirectional.\nHowever, by integrating an additional automated step into the swap process —\npowered by the SMSG network — we've made it appear as if Monero can now be\noffered.\n\nEven though it is fundamentally a clever workaround — essentially providing the\nillusion of a truly bidirectional swap — it is entirely seamless for the end\nuser and doesn't necessitate any additional manual input or requirements.\n\nRefer to the original adaptor signature atomic swap flow chart provided earlier\nin this article. Now, compare it to this flow chart displaying the process of\nexecuting a 'reverse Monero atomic swap' using adaptor signatures on BasicSwap\nDEX, again from the perspective of the offerer.\n\nSee reversed flowchart from the bidder's perspective: \nhttps://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.rev.bidder.xu.min.svg\nFrom this, it's clear that the base protocol stays the same, but there are a few\nmore steps and processing involved — all occurring in the background without\nnecessitating further human intervention.\n\nIndeed, whereas a PART (or BTC) to XMR swap would send a bid, a XMR to PART swap\ninstead sends a 'bid request' that has to be accepted by the bidder. A bid is\nthen constructed from this request and the protocol proceeds as normal, just\nwith the parties transposed.\n\nTechnical Documentation\ndoc: Describe reverse adaptor sig protocol. · tecnovert/basicswap@be46d8aBasic\nAtomic Swap Proof of Concept.

Now, in contrast to the previous setup where Monero could only be\nchosen as the requested coin, you also have the option to offer it when placing\na new offer on the order book.\n\nThere are no extra steps or additional prerequisites involved. However, remember\nthat this process is fundamentally a unidirectional atomic swap, enhanced with\nsome additional SMSG logic. Therefore, the other cryptocurrency you're\nrequesting should have some form of malleability fix in place, like Segwit, just\nlike any other adaptor signature-based atomic swap. \n\nTo benefit from the new bidirectional atomic swaps, all you need to do is ensure\nthat your local BasicSwap instance is up-to-date with the latest version. To\ninstall it, simply update BasicSwap through the usual process\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html] \n(video walkthrough [https://youtu.be/kk3FtE_TKBQ]) and launch the DEX again.\n\n * Shutdown BasicSwap properly and stop the Docker image.\n * From the basicswap folder, type the git pull command.\n * In the /docker folder, run the docker-compose build command.\n * Once the process completes, launch BasicSwap again using the docker-compose\n   up command.\n\nIf you're not using the Docker setup, you can follow the Particl Academy's\nstep-by-step update guide here\n[https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_update.html]\n.\n\nWhat Impact Will This Have on Our Future?\nThe introduction of bidirectional Monero atomic swaps for all symbolizes a\nmonumental step towards establishing a privacy-first, resilient global economy\nthat is fair to all.\n\nIndeed, we've observed a steady increase in aggressive, restrictive measures\ntargeting privacy coins like Particl and Monero in recent years, a trend that\nhas only accelerated in recent weeks. As evidenced by the removal of the\ncryptocurrency from numerous centralized exchanges such as Binance, the\naccessibility of Monero has significantly dwindled for many individuals\nworldwide, even though it remains legal. The rate at which these measures are\nbeing enforced is only likely to speed up over time.\n\nFurthermore, increasingly complicated regulations targeting custodial\ncryptocurrency businesses (referred to as \"MSB\") are being enshrined in law or,\nat the very least, being seriously considered by several governments across the\nworld, highlighting a dire need for more self-custodial solutions such as\nBasicSwap DEX. As these circumstances evolve, it becomes increasingly clear that\ncryptocurrencies like Monero and truly decentralized and self-custodial\nsolutions like BasicSwap DEX, which have remained compliant with the various\nglobal regulations, are needed.\n\nDecentralized Trading Exchanges: The Ultimate Refuge\nFortunately, truly decentralized trading exchanges (DEXs), which operate\nentirely without any central component or service provider, are still allowed\nand serve as safe haven in the preservation of crypto's root values. Monero's\nwidespread availability on these platforms is critical not only for its\nsurvival, but also for the preservation of our human rights.\n\nHowever, the absence of programmable outputs in Monero has been a long-standing\nchallenge when integrating them into these platforms. This situation has\nresulted in Monero having one of the lowest presences amongst popular\ncryptocurrencies on such decentralized exchanges. The arrival of adaptor\nsignature-based atomic swaps initiated a change, but until now, the inability to\nexecute bidirectional atomic swaps posed an understandable but significant\nbarrier to the Monero community's extensive use of atomic swaps.\n\nThe integration of bidirectional Monero atomic swaps into the BasicSwap DEX\nmarks a shift in this scenario, reinforcing our conviction in the significance\nof today's announcement.\n\nThe Road Ahead\nOf course, there’s a lot of work that still needs to be done. For instance,\nBasicSwap, operating as a local application hosting various blockchains, remains\nrelatively complex to initiate. Even though we've streamlined the setup process\nwith the soon-to-come release of an executable (.exe) installer and launcher,\nthe resultant user experience still falls short when compared to centralized\nexchanges — although, once set up, it operates in remarkably similar ways.\n\nThis fact underscores our recent emphasis on developing a web framework that\nwill equip BasicSwap to deliver web services and power decentralized trading\nplatforms on the web. With this major headway, platforms will be able to harness\nBasicSwap's unparalleled decentralization and uncompromising privacy without\nhaving to run a local application, synchronize chains, or deposit coins into web\nwallets.\n\nWhile this major upgrade is still under construction, the launch of\nbidirectional Monero atomic swaps on BasicSwap today frees up more resources for\nthe development of this crucial web infrastructure, making it now our prime\nfocus moving forward.\n\nWe encourage you to stay tuned to our blog at Particl News\n[https://particl.news] for updates on this topic.

However, it does mean a Monero holder cannot be the one to create the offer. In other words, if you hold Monero and want Bitcoin, you must accept an offer created by someone else requesting Monero for Bitcoin.

It also prevents Monero offerers from trading at the exact rate they want, as they are constrained to the rates of existing trade offers.</p><p>To mitigate this issue, we have devoted consistent effort to developing a solution, with the goal of providing Monero users with the same advantages enjoyed by users of other coins on a DEX like BasicSwap.</p><h2 id=\"bidirectional-monero-and-part-anon-swaps-are-here-\">Bidirectional Monero and Part (Anon) Swaps Are Here! ?</h2><p>We are proud to announce that we’ve finally implemented bidirectional Monero atomic swaps into BasicSwap mainnet, now available on the live beta and accessible for everyone! This breakthrough implies that the prior constraints on Monero users are no longer relevant, and that Monero users can now both request AND offer Monero when adding offers on BasicSwap's order book.</p><h1 id=\"how-was-it-accomplished\">How was it Accomplished?</h1><p>Monero atomic swaps being solely a unidirectional process is a direct consequence of Monero's robust codebase which offers limited scripting capabilities, but enhanced resilience against different types of exploits.</p><p>As such, we achieved bidirectional swaps without altering the Monero codebase or making extensive changes to Joel Gugger’s adaptor signature-based Monero atomic swap protocol (beyond our previous enhancements to the protocol's privacy and transaction size management, as detailed <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\">here</a></strong>).</p><p>Instead, our strategy leveraged BasicSwap's strong suit — its use of the <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\"><strong>SMSG network</strong></a> with a focus on end user experience. After all, BasicSwap's primary goal as a DEX protocol is to simplify the process of atomic swaps and make it easy and more accessible for people to transition away from centralized exchanges. Therefore, user experience is paramount and is what truly matters in our case.</p><h2 id=\"leveraging-the-smsg-network\">Leveraging the SMSG Network</h2><p>On BasicSwap, the offerer creates a swap request or 'offer' on the DEX’s order book, while participants (aka 'bidders') take a look at the order book, locate an offer that interests them, and initiate a swap. This process mirrors the maker-taker system of traditional centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.</p><p>However, this user experience isn't inherently part of atomic swap technology, as we've outlined in <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before\">this blog post</a></strong>, but is facilitated by Particl's unique SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a decentralized, privacy-first messaging network, also known as 'mixnets' (see <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\">this article</a></strong> for more information on SMSG).</p><p>The SMSG network serves as a powerful tool and a crucial component in making BasicSwap DEX a user-centric platform. Turns out, it also ultimately became the key to implementing bidirectional Monero atomic swaps.</p><h2 id=\"simulating-offers-requesting-monero\">Simulating Offers Requesting Monero</h2><p>Our solution to the unidirectionality of Monero atomic swaps doesn't hinge on modifying the Monero codebase or its adaptor signature atomic swap protocol. Instead, it leverages the SMSG network to simulate offers featuring Monero.</p><p>In reality, BasicSwap still employs the same semi-scriptless adaptor signature protocol. Hence, at the protocol level, the swaps remain unidirectional. However, by integrating an additional automated step into the swap process — powered by the SMSG network — we've made it appear as if Monero can now be offered.</p><p>Even though it is fundamentally a clever workaround — essentially providing the illusion of a truly bidirectional swap — it is entirely seamless for the end user and doesn't necessitate any additional manual input or requirements.</p><p>Refer to the original adaptor signature atomic swap flow chart provided earlier in this article. Now, compare it to this flow chart displaying the process of executing a 'reverse Monero atomic swap' using adaptor signatures on BasicSwap DEX, again from the perspective of the offerer.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/08/image-3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt srcset=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/image-3.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/image-3.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/08/image-3.png 1272w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption><em><strong>See reversed flowchart from the bidder's perspective: </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.rev.bidder.xu.min.svg\">https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.rev.bidder.xu.min.svg</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>From this, it's clear that the base protocol stays the same, but there are a few more steps and processing involved — all occurring in the background without necessitating further human intervention.</p><p>Indeed, whereas a PART (or BTC) to XMR swap would send a bid, a XMR to PART swap instead sends a 'bid request' that has to be accepted by the bidder.

As evidenced by the removal of the cryptocurrency from numerous centralized exchanges such as Binance, the accessibility of Monero has significantly dwindled for many individuals worldwide, even though it remains legal. The rate at which these measures are being enforced is only likely to speed up over time.</p><p>Furthermore, increasingly complicated regulations targeting custodial cryptocurrency businesses (referred to as \"MSB\") are being enshrined in law or, at the very least, being seriously considered by several governments across the world, highlighting a dire need for more self-custodial solutions such as BasicSwap DEX. As these circumstances evolve, it becomes increasingly clear that cryptocurrencies like Monero and <strong>truly decentralized and self-custodial solutions</strong> like BasicSwap DEX, which have remained compliant with the various global regulations, are needed.</p><h2 id=\"decentralized-trading-exchanges-the-ultimate-refuge\">Decentralized Trading Exchanges: The Ultimate Refuge</h2><p>Fortunately, truly decentralized trading exchanges (DEXs), which operate entirely without any central component or service provider, are still allowed and serve as safe haven in the preservation of crypto's root values. Monero's widespread availability on these platforms is critical not only for its survival, but also for the preservation of our human rights.</p><p>However, the absence of programmable outputs in Monero has been a long-standing challenge when integrating them into these platforms. This situation has resulted in Monero having one of the lowest presences amongst popular cryptocurrencies on such decentralized exchanges. The arrival of adaptor signature-based atomic swaps initiated a change, but until now, the inability to execute bidirectional atomic swaps posed an understandable but significant barrier to the Monero community's extensive use of atomic swaps.</p><p>The integration of bidirectional Monero atomic swaps into the BasicSwap DEX marks a shift in this scenario, reinforcing our conviction in the significance of today's announcement.</p><h2 id=\"the-road-ahead\">The Road Ahead</h2><p>Of course, there’s a lot of work that still needs to be done. For instance, BasicSwap, operating as a local application hosting various blockchains, remains relatively complex to initiate. Even though we've streamlined the setup process with the soon-to-come release of an executable (.exe) installer and launcher, the resultant user experience still falls short when compared to centralized exchanges — although, once set up, it operates in remarkably similar ways.</p><p>This fact underscores our recent emphasis on developing a web framework that will equip BasicSwap to deliver web services and power decentralized trading platforms on the web. With this major headway, platforms will be able to harness BasicSwap's unparalleled decentralization and uncompromising privacy without having to run a local application, synchronize chains, or deposit coins into web wallets.</p><p>While this major upgrade is still under construction, the launch of bidirectional Monero atomic swaps on BasicSwap today frees up more resources for the development of this crucial web infrastructure, making it now our prime focus moving forward.</p><p>We encourage you to stay tuned to our blog at <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news\">Particl News</a></strong> for updates on this topic.

It also prevents Monero offerers from trading at the exact rate they want, as they are constrained to the rates of existing trade offers.</p><p>To mitigate this issue, we have devoted consistent effort to developing a solution, with the goal of providing Monero users with the same advantages enjoyed by users of other coins on a DEX like BasicSwap.</p><h2 id=\"bidirectional-monero-and-part-anon-swaps-are-here-\">Bidirectional Monero and Part (Anon) Swaps Are Here! ?</h2><p>We are proud to announce that we’ve finally implemented bidirectional Monero atomic swaps into BasicSwap mainnet, now available on the live beta and accessible for everyone! This breakthrough implies that the prior constraints on Monero users are no longer relevant, and that Monero users can now both request AND offer Monero when adding offers on BasicSwap's order book.</p><h1 id=\"how-was-it-accomplished\">How was it Accomplished?</h1><p>Monero atomic swaps being solely a unidirectional process is a direct consequence of Monero's robust codebase which offers limited scripting capabilities, but enhanced resilience against different types of exploits.</p><p>As such, we achieved bidirectional swaps without altering the Monero codebase or making extensive changes to Joel Gugger’s adaptor signature-based Monero atomic swap protocol (beyond our previous enhancements to the protocol's privacy and transaction size management, as detailed <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\">here</a></strong>).</p><p>Instead, our strategy leveraged BasicSwap's strong suit — its use of the <a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\"><strong>SMSG network</strong></a> with a focus on end user experience. After all, BasicSwap's primary goal as a DEX protocol is to simplify the process of atomic swaps and make it easy and more accessible for people to transition away from centralized exchanges. Therefore, user experience is paramount and is what truly matters in our case.</p><h2 id=\"leveraging-the-smsg-network\">Leveraging the SMSG Network</h2><p>On BasicSwap, the offerer creates a swap request or 'offer' on the DEX’s order book, while participants (aka 'bidders') take a look at the order book, locate an offer that interests them, and initiate a swap. This process mirrors the maker-taker system of traditional centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.</p><p>However, this user experience isn't inherently part of atomic swap technology, as we've outlined in <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before\">this blog post</a></strong>, but is facilitated by Particl's unique SecureMessaging Network (SMSG), a decentralized, privacy-first messaging network, also known as 'mixnets' (see <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news/the-dex-revolution-how-to-make-atomic-swaps-more-accessible-and-private-than-ever-before#additional-privacy-and-scalability-improvements\">this article</a></strong> for more information on SMSG).</p><p>The SMSG network serves as a powerful tool and a crucial component in making BasicSwap DEX a user-centric platform. Turns out, it also ultimately became the key to implementing bidirectional Monero atomic swaps.</p><h2 id=\"simulating-offers-requesting-monero\">Simulating Offers Requesting Monero</h2><p>Our solution to the unidirectionality of Monero atomic swaps doesn't hinge on modifying the Monero codebase or its adaptor signature atomic swap protocol. Instead, it leverages the SMSG network to simulate offers featuring Monero.</p><p>In reality, BasicSwap still employs the same semi-scriptless adaptor signature protocol. Hence, at the protocol level, the swaps remain unidirectional. However, by integrating an additional automated step into the swap process — powered by the SMSG network — we've made it appear as if Monero can now be offered.</p><p>Even though it is fundamentally a clever workaround — essentially providing the illusion of a truly bidirectional swap — it is entirely seamless for the end user and doesn't necessitate any additional manual input or requirements.</p><p>Refer to the original adaptor signature atomic swap flow chart provided earlier in this article. Now, compare it to this flow chart displaying the process of executing a 'reverse Monero atomic swap' using adaptor signatures on BasicSwap DEX, again from the perspective of the offerer.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/2023/08/image-3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"/glink/size/w600/2023/08/image-3.png 600w, /glink/size/w1000/2023/08/image-3.png 1000w, /glink/2023/08/image-3.png 1272w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"><figcaption><em><strong>See reversed flowchart from the bidder's perspective: </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.rev.bidder.xu.min.svg\">https://github.com/tecnovert/basicswap/blob/master/basicswap/static/sequence_diagrams/ads.rev.bidder.xu.min.svg</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>From this, it's clear that the base protocol stays the same, but there are a few more steps and processing involved — all occurring in the background without necessitating further human intervention.</p><p>Indeed, whereas a PART (or BTC) to XMR swap would send a bid, a XMR to PART swap instead sends a 'bid request' that has to be accepted by the bidder.

As evidenced by the removal of the cryptocurrency from numerous centralized exchanges such as Binance, the accessibility of Monero has significantly dwindled for many individuals worldwide, even though it remains legal. The rate at which these measures are being enforced is only likely to speed up over time.</p><p>Furthermore, increasingly complicated regulations targeting custodial cryptocurrency businesses (referred to as \"MSB\") are being enshrined in law or, at the very least, being seriously considered by several governments across the world, highlighting a dire need for more self-custodial solutions such as BasicSwap DEX. As these circumstances evolve, it becomes increasingly clear that cryptocurrencies like Monero and <strong>truly decentralized and self-custodial solutions</strong> like BasicSwap DEX, which have remained compliant with the various global regulations, are needed.</p><h2 id=\"decentralized-trading-exchanges-the-ultimate-refuge\">Decentralized Trading Exchanges: The Ultimate Refuge</h2><p>Fortunately, truly decentralized trading exchanges (DEXs), which operate entirely without any central component or service provider, are still allowed and serve as safe haven in the preservation of crypto's root values. Monero's widespread availability on these platforms is critical not only for its survival, but also for the preservation of our human rights.</p><p>However, the absence of programmable outputs in Monero has been a long-standing challenge when integrating them into these platforms. This situation has resulted in Monero having one of the lowest presences amongst popular cryptocurrencies on such decentralized exchanges. The arrival of adaptor signature-based atomic swaps initiated a change, but until now, the inability to execute bidirectional atomic swaps posed an understandable but significant barrier to the Monero community's extensive use of atomic swaps.</p><p>The integration of bidirectional Monero atomic swaps into the BasicSwap DEX marks a shift in this scenario, reinforcing our conviction in the significance of today's announcement.</p><h2 id=\"the-road-ahead\">The Road Ahead</h2><p>Of course, there’s a lot of work that still needs to be done. For instance, BasicSwap, operating as a local application hosting various blockchains, remains relatively complex to initiate. Even though we've streamlined the setup process with the soon-to-come release of an executable (.exe) installer and launcher, the resultant user experience still falls short when compared to centralized exchanges — although, once set up, it operates in remarkably similar ways.</p><p>This fact underscores our recent emphasis on developing a web framework that will equip BasicSwap to deliver web services and power decentralized trading platforms on the web. With this major headway, platforms will be able to harness BasicSwap's unparalleled decentralization and uncompromising privacy without having to run a local application, synchronize chains, or deposit coins into web wallets.</p><p>While this major upgrade is still under construction, the launch of bidirectional Monero atomic swaps on BasicSwap today frees up more resources for the development of this crucial web infrastructure, making it now our prime focus moving forward.</p><p>We encourage you to stay tuned to our blog at <strong><a href=\"https://particl.news\">Particl News</a></strong> for updates on this topic.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.
