You can now download and install the new desktop client and thoroughly\ntest all the new additions and improvements.\n\nUser Messaging (Marketplace) ?\nYou can now send messages to the seller directly from a listing's public\nchatroomThis new Particl Desktop client update introduces a new and major\nmarketplace feature: user messaging. It lets sellers and buyers (as well as\npotential buyers) communicate with each other in a free-flow form.\n\nUser messaging is available in two different ways. On one end, each listing now\nhas a \"public chatroom\" in which any user can ask questions to the seller. All\nmessages posted in a listing's chatroom are publicly viewable, meaning anyone\ncan see current and past messages sent this way. This function is likely to\nreplace the \"Reviews\" functionality, although we would love to get your feedback\nand thoughts on the matter during Particl Desktop 3.2's testnet round.\n\nOn the other end, a private chatroom, only accessible and viewable to the seller\nand the buyer of an item, is opened up when placing an order. Communications\ninitiated this way are entirely end-to-end encrypted and anonymous, and it is\nimpossible for any third-party or middleman to intercept messages. Messages are\npropagated through the SMSG network and never go through any central server.\nPrivate in-order chatrooms are available from the Order section of the Purchases\nand Sell pages, depending on whether you are the seller or the buyer.\n\n> Note: At this time, the messaging system is tied to the marketplace and isn't a\nstandalone feature yet. We plan on isolating that feature moving forward to make\nit possible to open private chatrooms with individuals without having to use\nParticl Marketplace.\nDefault Market Behavior ?\nStarting from Particl Desktop 3.2, the Open Market is not automatically joined\nby default anymore and it is also possible to leave that market.\n\nThis new approach gives you more control over your experience and will reduce\nyour market file size should you not be interested in what's on the Open Market.\nThe Open Market remains available to join at any time within the Market Browser\nand a link to join it is clearly displayed upon first launching the marketplace\napp (for newcomers/fresh installs).\n\n> Note: If you have already used Particl Marketplace in the past, your client will\nremain connected to the Open Market unless you manually leave it. \nProduct Codes ?️\nThis update introduces product codes to help vendor better manage their products\nand integrate their inventory into their already-existing inventory management\nsystems.\n\nProduct codes are unique identifiers that can be added to listing templates.\nThey are user-defined and do not show up publicly when publishing items on the\nmarket; they are purely intended as back-end information for the seller.\n\n> Note: This feature was a prerequisite for the deployment of the listing seeding\nproposal. [http://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html]\nAnd many more... ?\nThere are a lot of other UI and user experience improvements coming along with\nParticl Desktop 3.2. For a full list of these changes, refer to the change log \nhere [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0-RC-001] or\nat the bottom of this blog post.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started\nDownload Particl Desktop 3.2.0-RC-001: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0-RC-001\n\nRelease Particl Desktop v3.2.0 Public Testnet (release 1) ·\nparticl/particl-desktopTestnet release version for the upcoming v3.2.0RELEASE\nINFORMATION BUILDNETWORKPARTICL CORE (MIN VERSION)MARKETPLACE VERSIONWALLET\nVERSION 3.2.0 (RC 001)testnet0.21.2.90.3.91.7.0 ...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0-RC-001]To get\ntestnet coins, visit the Particl faucet [https://faucet.particl.xyz/].\n\nIf you happen to be a newcomer to Particl at all we highly recommend the Particl\nAcademy as your guide and reference book for getting along with Particl\nMarketplace.\n\nPARTICL ACADEMY\n\nNotes\n * If you encounter problems connecting to peers, it may be caused by the low\n   number of nodes on the testnet network. To fix this issue, open up your\n   Particl Desktop debug console and type the following command to connect to a\n   seeding node: addnode \"104.248.38.233:51938\" \"add\" or addnode\n   \"165.22.203.185:51938\" \"add\".\n * If you spot any issue, bug, or area of improvement, please report it directly\n   on the Github Issues [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] \n   page.\n * Your wallet needs to be unlocked to process buy and sell orders on the\n   marketplace.\n * Particl Marketplace is still in on-going development, and thus, is considered\n   to be a Beta release.\n * The Particl Desktop testnet application and the Particl Desktop mainnet\n   application can coexist on your computer but they can't run at the same time.\n\nAdvanced Start-up\nSometimes it's helpful to start the application from the terminal, aka command\nline. It gives you additional information about what's happening in the\nbackground and can be useful for troubleshooting issues (if issues you\nencounter).\n\nWindows\n 1. Open \"Windows Explorer\"\n 2. On the installation folder (e.g. \"C:\\Program Files\\Particl Desktop\n    Testnet\\Particl Desktop Testnet\") Press [SHIFT⇧]+[MOUSE-RIGHT◳] and choose\n    \"Open command window here\"\n 3. Type the following command including the quotation marks into the terminal\n    and hit [ENTER ↵] \"Particl Desktop Testnet.exe\"\n\nMac\n 1. Open \"Terminal\" \n    (e.g. [COMMAND ⌘] + [SPACE] and type terminal > hit [ENTER ↵])\n 2. Type in this command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    /Applications/Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet.app/Contents/MacOS/Particl\\ Desktop\\\n    Testnet\n\nLinux\n 1. Open a terminal in the folder where you’ve installed the application and\n    type the following command and hit [ENTER ↵]:\n    ./Particl\\ Desktop\\ Testnet\n\nList of Changes\nMarketplace App\nIncluded here are the changes applied to both the UI of the marketplace, as well\nas the market service, for convenience:\n\n * The previous default market, the Open Market, is no longer joined by default\n   on a fresh/clean installation.\n * Navigating to the \"listings browser\" section, when no markets are joined,\n   will now indicate that a market needs to be joined (and present navigation\n   options to the \"market browser\").\n * If the Open Market market is not currently joined, the option to join this\n   market is displayed semi-permanently above the list of promoted markets\n   (making it available as an option for new users when no market is actively\n   being promoted).\n * For users updating from earlier versions in which the Open Market was joined\n   by default, the ability to remove/un-join the Open Market is now available\n   (i.e., the Open Market can be removed/un-joined just like any other market).\n * An additional filter has been added to the Batch Publish Modal to allow for\n   the filtering of items that have previously been published to a selected\n   market.\n * Product codes, or unique seller codes for items, can now be specified for\n   different items. A product code can only be added to a product template but\n   it is visible on the market-specific templates that are derived from the same\n   product template. Product codes are not included when publishing an item to a\n   market and are intended simply as a means for the seller to uniquely identify\n   specific items.\n * The 'State' input on an address (when purchasing an item, in the Cart page),\n   is no longer a required field. The required fields on the Address form should\n   now be more easily identified.\n * Added the ability to send chat messages on Orders and Listings. Listing\n   messages are public (anyone with the ability to view the listing can see any\n   chat messages on the listing itself), whereas the Order related chat messages\n   are only visible between the buyer and seller.\n\nWallet\n * An issue has been fixed where a mouse click into the Send page > Narration\n   input field, when this field contains a value, would not place the cursor at\n   the correct position on the value (the cursor either jumps to the end or the\n   beginning of the value only).\n * It is now possible to abandon a transaction with 0 confirmation.\n * A selected wallet from the wallet selection drop-down list no longer \"jumps\"\n   to the top of the wallet list. The selected wallet is still displayed as\n   before, but on opening the wallet selection drop-down list the positioning of\n   the wallets no longer changes. Wallets are now also grouped according to\n   location/function. This all should make wallet selection slightly easier\n   particularly when several wallets have been created.\n\nKNOWN ISSUES\n * Please only use the .dmg file to install the application for Mac OSX 10.15 or\n   greater. The .app file extracted from the zip package does not currently run\n   on OSX 10.15 (although it should work correctly on 10.14 (Mojave) or\n   earlier).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs mentioned above, we would love to get your input on the deprecation of the\n\"Reviews\" functionality in favor of the new Chat system. Feel free to test it\nout, ask questions, and leave your remarks on our chatrooms, your thoughts are\ngreatly appreciated and help us shape a better product for the benefit of all!\n\nOnce a few days of testnet have passed and barring any major issue, Particl\nDesktop 3.2 will be ready for release on mainnet. We will soon communicate what\nare the plans for moving towards Particl Desktop 3.3 and beyond, so make sure to\nstay tuned!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl is Participation\nGet recognized as someone that cares.

A product code can only be added to a product template but it is visible on the market-specific templates that are derived from the same product template. Product codes are not included when publishing an item to a market and are intended simply as a means for the seller to uniquely identify specific items.</li><li>The 'State' input on an address (when purchasing an item, in the Cart page), is no longer a required field. The required fields on the Address form should now be more easily identified.</li><li>Added the ability to send chat messages on Orders and Listings. Listing messages are public (anyone with the ability to view the listing can see any chat messages on the listing itself), whereas the Order related chat messages are only visible between the buyer and seller.</li></ul><h3 id=\"wallet\">Wallet</h3><ul><li>An issue has been fixed where a mouse click into the Send page > Narration input field, when this field contains a value, would not place the cursor at the correct position on the value (the cursor either jumps to the end or the beginning of the value only).</li><li>It is now possible to abandon a transaction with 0 confirmation.</li><li>A selected wallet from the wallet selection drop-down list no longer \"jumps\" to the top of the wallet list. The selected wallet is still displayed as before, but on opening the wallet selection drop-down list the positioning of the wallets no longer changes. Wallets are now also grouped according to location/function. This all should make wallet selection slightly easier particularly when several wallets have been created.</li></ul><h3 id=\"known-issues\">KNOWN ISSUES</h3><ul><li>Please only use the .dmg file to install the application for Mac OSX 10.15 or greater. The .app file extracted from the zip package does not currently run on OSX 10.15 (although it should work correctly on 10.14 (Mojave) or earlier).</li></ul><hr><p>As mentioned above, we would love to get your input on the deprecation of the \"Reviews\" functionality in favor of the new Chat system. Feel free to test it out, ask questions, and leave your remarks on our chatrooms, your thoughts are greatly appreciated and help us shape a better product for the benefit of all!</p><p>Once a few days of testnet have passed and barring any major issue, Particl Desktop 3.2 will be ready for release on mainnet.

Indeed, you can now download and\ninstall the new desktop client and enjoy all the new features, improvements, and\nbug fixes!\n\nMarketplace Messaging System ?\nNotably, this release introduces the widely-anticipated messaging system that\nallows sellers and buyers (and potential buyers as well) to communicate with\neach other. This new functionality is available in two different ways.\n\nOn one end, each listing now has a \"public chatroom\" in which any user can ask\nquestions to the seller. All messages posted in a listing's chatroom are\npublicly viewable, meaning anyone can see current and past messages sent this\nway.\n\nOn the other end, a private chatroom, only accessible and viewable to the seller\nand the buyer of an item, is opened up when placing an order. Communications\ninitiated this way are entirely end-to-end encrypted and anonymous, and it is\nimpossible for any third-party or middleman to intercept messages. Messages are\npropagated through the SMSG network and never go through any central server.\nPrivate in-order chatrooms are available from the Order section of the Purchases\nand Sell pages, depending on whether you are the seller or the buyer.\n\nProduct Codes ?️\nProduct codes allow a seller to uniquely identify their items according to their\nown predefined system. Note that this has no impact on the buyer side as the\nproduct codes are not publicly displayed along with a listing; they simply exist\nto provide some assistance to sellers in terms of inventory management. \n\nThe introduction of product codes is necessary for future additional features\nand for the deployment of the listing seeding system as detailed in this CCS\nproposal [http://ccs.particl.io/proposals/marketplace%20listing%20seeding.html].\n\nVarious Improvements ✔️\nAside from the two new features mentioned above, Particl Desktop 3.2 introduces\na few more improvements to both the marketplace app and the wallet. Check out\nthe full list of changes here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0] or at the\nbottom of this blog post.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started\nDownload Particl Desktop 3.2 on mainnet: \nhttps://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0\n\nRelease v3.2.0 · particl/particl-desktopParticl Desktop v3.2.0RELEASE\nINFORMATION BUILDNETWORKPARTICL CORE (MIN VERSION)MARKETPLACE VERSIONWALLET\nVERSION 3.2.0mainnet0.21.2.90.3.91.7.0 UPDATES AND FIXES[market\nmodule]...GitHub\nparticl [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/releases/tag/v3.2.0]If you\nhappen to be a newcomer to Particl at all we highly recommend the Particl\nAcademy as your guide and reference book for getting along with Particl\nMarketplace.\n\nOpen Particl Academy [https://academy.particl.io]\n\nNotes\n * Your wallet needs to be unlocked to process buy and sell orders on the\n   marketplace.\n * There may be issues launching Particl Desktop 3.2 on some specific Linux OS\n   such as Manjaro. This is due to an issue with Electron and will be fixed with\n   the release of Particl Desktop 3.3. \n * If you spot any issue, bug, or area of improvement, please report it directly\n   on the Github Issues [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/issues] \n   page.\n\nAdvanced Start-up\nSometimes, it's helpful to start the application from the terminal, aka command\nline.

The selected wallet is still displayed as\n   before, but on opening the wallet selection drop-down list the positioning of\n   the wallets no longer changes. \n * Wallets are now grouped according to location/function.

It promised us, the people, a level of financial and\neconomic freedom truly never seen before.\n\nBut is Bitcoin really enough, and can it survive the onslaught of government\nregulations and control coming its way? The answer is nuanced and more complex\nthan most like to admit.\n\nThe Worrying Reality of Financial Spying\nAs we've seen in previous Particl stories (1\n[https://particl.news/the-internet-is-centralized-that-spells-trouble-for-all-of-us/]\n, 2 [https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/], 3\n[https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/]), the web is\nundergoing a worrying trend of centralization and data consumption abuse. Every\nday, online services that you use collect more and more data about yourself so\nthat they can be used, shared, and monetized by corporations - generally\nwithout\nyour informed consent\n[https://particl.news/gdpr-and-consent-based-privacy-regulations-flaws/]. That\ndata is disseminated to all sorts of interested parties, going from corporations\nto governments, all the way to politically motivated groups who would like to\nuse it against you or for their own motives.\n\nIt is now common knowledge that governments around the world track our financial\nlife. With collaboration from the banks and payment service companies, many\ngovernments can, at any time, request any level of financial information about\nyou. And while a lot of us may not have anything particularly nefarious to hide,\nit still impacts and involves us in very concrete ways! Let's look at a very\nrecent example illustrating perfectly the risks associated with traceable\nfinancial data.\n\nBe Careful How You Partake in Politics - Or You'll Get the Stick\nYou've probably heard of the \"trucker protests\" that unfolded earlier this year;\nstarted in Canada, these anti-mandate, anti-lockdown protests subsequently\ninspired other similar convoys in other countries. This protest turned into a\nbig political arm-wrestling match, with both sides of the political spectrum\nframing them either as a prime example of peaceful demonstration or as an\nirresponsible demonstration of carelessness sometimes nearing terrorism.\n\nAnd as any major political and partisan event these days unfolds, the internet\nlit up and both sides mobilized to try and ridicule or destroy the other side.\n\nMobilizing many individuals for such an extended period of time takes funds, and\nthose funds typically come in the form of donations. Thousands of people all\naround the world donated to the trucker movement, only for GoFundMe to block\nthe\nfundraising and threaten to redirect the funds to charities of their choosing\n[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gofundme-freedom-convoy-under-investigation-for-blocking-donations-canadian-truckers/] \n(which, under pressure, they opted against in favor of reimbursing people). In\nresponse, pro-convoy members of the public started using a little known yet more\nopen donation service: GiveSendGo.\n\nGiveSendGo advertised itself as a free (as in freedom) donation service that\nwould support the movement and not interfere with the donations. But it wasn’t\nto be: a few days after donations started to flock in, the website was exploited\nand hacked, which led to the \"doxing\" of thousands of donors\n[https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/14/freedom-convoy-donor-leak-givesendgo/]. Their\nnames, email addresses, ZIP codes, and IP addresses were made public. The\nhorror! And in such a politically charged climate, one can imagine the potential\nimpact such a leak could have on the private lives of people who donated to the\ntrucker convoy.\n\nNo matter one's political opinion on this two-fold example, truth is that the\nissue it highlights is relevant to almost any heated topic, be it political or\nnot. Financial privacy is of utmost importance in a day and age where data can\nbe weaponized. \n\nThis tells us is that the web sorely needs to improve on two things when it\ncomes to digital payments. One, there is a need for payments to go truly digital\nand trustless so that they can't be frozen, reversed, or blocked. And two, there\nis a clear and broad need for some payments to be accomplished anonymously to\nprotect the personal and financial data of those making transactions.\n\nAnd then came Bitcoin\nBitcoin, the father of cryptocurrencies, offered us half of the solution: a\nrevolutionary method of payment that could not be seized, frozen, reversed, or\nblocked.\n\nUnfortunately, we’ve seen some very concerning events unfold in just the past\nfew weeks – from Ethereum service provider Infura and Metamask freezing crypto\naccounts\n[https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/03/metamask-infura-block-certain-areas-amid-crypto-sanctions-fury/]\n, to the so-called decentralized marketplace OpenSea blocking off users from\ntheir assets on the basis on their Russian nationality\n[https://medium.com/coinmonks/as-metamask-and-opensea-abide-by-us-sanctions-the-russian-ban-is-in-the-spotlight-67611df121f8]\n. This all boils down to cryptocurrency users too often depending on centralized\nentities.\n\nBitcoin and cryptocurrencies are still providing all the freedom they set out to\nprovide; but if you use third-party services, you in effect forfeit true\nownership of your coins and go back to the old patterns of not owning your\nmoney. Pro-tip: Always use non-custodial wallets and be very careful which\nservice you send your coins to!\n\nA question however remains: how did these companies know the identity and\nnationality of the owners of certain crypto addresses in the first place?\n\nBitcoin: Often Anything but Anonymous\nIn a day and age where financial data is worth gold, Bitcoin suffers from a\nterrible Achille's heel: all transactions are transparent and publicly displayed\non an open ledger, and all the financial data of its holders in effect become\navailable information. And that's becoming increasingly worrying as blockchain\ntracing firms and crypto service providers are now in possession of very\ninvasive and effective technology to trace Bitcoin payments.\n\nTo illustrate the sad reality of today's Bitcoin, see it this way. How would you\nfeel walking down the street, with a picture of your bank account and credit\ncard(s) balances stamped on your forehead? Anyone that walks past you and that\nis curious enough to look up would see exactly how much you own and in which\naccount. They would also be able to see exactly with who you’ve transacted since\nyou opened your accounts. They could see exactly what you bought, what you\ninvested in, how much you donated to whom, a full and precise picture of your\nrevenue and savings, and so on. Clearly, no one in their right mind would do\nthis.\n\nIn many cases, this is precisely what Bitcoin does to your financial information\nnow. With all the tracing tech around, combined with the need to KYC yourself to\nuse almost any exchange or service provider, anyone curious enough can simply\nquery the publicly available information, draft a provably accurate and very\nprecise picture of your finances, and know exactly who's financial profile that\nis.\n\nThe array of people that can now know this information extends from governments\nand banks, to almost any corporation or private individual. A notable \"step\ndown\" from the traditional financial system when it comes to financial privacy.\n\nA Good Crypto is a Private Crypto\nAs great as Bitcoin sounds, it is having a hard time realizing its initial\nvision - even after 14 years of existence - precisely because of those privacy\nissues. Luckily, it's not the only digital currency around.\n\nWe've seen a few cryptocurrencies focus solely on this issue of privacy, making\nthem very good candidates to be considered as true alternatives to cash and as\ngreat settlement layers for the web of today and tomorrow.\n\nAmongst them there is Monero, which uses the very solid RingCT privacy protocol,\nor Firo with its more exotic privacy setup. We also have Zcash, a very\nwell-known privacy coin - and many others. Each of them presents a different\ntwist to the angle of privacy and comes with different codebases, strengths, and\nlimitations.\n\nBut privacy generally comes with concessions in flexibility. While the examples\nmentioned above are great alternatives to Bitcoin because of the privacy they\nprovide, their use-case is pretty much limited to person-to-person currency\ntransactions. And although they accomplish their purpose well, a lot of\npotentials is left unexploited, especially as we've seen, in recent years, the\nadvent of \"dapps\" (distributed applications) and of Web3, a new \"take\" on the\nweb that promises data ownership and to do away with centralized parties.\n\nBecause of the limitations of privacy coins, they, unfortunately, cannot be used\nin any Dapp or be an important part of Web3. And in reality, all the promises of\nWeb3 are more or less moot if its settlement layer is not private. They will\nfall prey to the same issues mentioned earlier in this article - whether it is\nWeb2 or Web3.\n\nA Modern Privacy Coin Fills That Gap\nThat is what motivated us to build PART [https://particl.io/coin]. It is a\nmodern privacy coin that uses the most battle-tested codebase, Bitcoin, and the\nmost battle-tested privacy protocol, RingCT (the same privacy protocol used by\nMonero). But unlike other privacy coins, PART [https://particl.io/coin] is built\nwith flexibility in mind, so that it can be used in Dapps and on Web3. Case in\npoint: PART is currently the default settlement layer of Particl Marketplace\n[https://particl.io/marketplace], a decentralized and private eBay-like\nmarketplace, where one can buy and sell anything without fees, middlemen, or\nrestrictions.\n\nBy leveraging the flexible Bitcoin codebase and adding to it solid privacy\ntechnologies, PART succeeds in fixing Bitcoin's biggest problem of financial\nspying, all the while being available for use as settlement for this new wave of\nWeb3 applications.

The answer is nuanced and more complex than most like to admit.</p><h2 id=\"the-worrying-reality-of-financial-spying\">The Worrying Reality of Financial Spying</h2><p>As we've seen in previous Particl stories (<a href=\"https://particl.news/the-internet-is-centralized-that-spells-trouble-for-all-of-us/\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://particl.news/anything-you-say-or-do-will-be-used-against-you/\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://particl.news/imagine-being-screwed-over-like-this/\">3</a>), the web is undergoing a worrying trend of centralization and data consumption abuse. Every day, online services that you use collect more and more data about yourself so that they can be used, shared, and monetized by corporations - <a href=\"https://particl.news/gdpr-and-consent-based-privacy-regulations-flaws/\">generally without your informed consent</a>. That data is disseminated to all sorts of interested parties, going from corporations to governments, all the way to politically motivated groups who would like to use it against you or for their own motives.</p><p>It is now common knowledge that governments around the world track our financial life. With collaboration from the banks and payment service companies, many governments can, at any time, request any level of financial information about you. And while a lot of us may not have anything particularly nefarious to hide, it still impacts and involves us in very concrete ways! Let's look at a very recent example illustrating perfectly the risks associated with traceable financial data.</p><h2 id=\"be-careful-how-you-partake-in-politics-or-you-ll-get-the-stick\">Be Careful How You Partake in Politics - Or You'll Get the Stick</h2><p>You've probably heard of the \"trucker protests\" that unfolded earlier this year; started in Canada, these anti-mandate, anti-lockdown protests subsequently inspired other similar convoys in other countries. This protest turned into a big political arm-wrestling match, with both sides of the political spectrum framing them either as a prime example of peaceful demonstration or as an irresponsible demonstration of carelessness sometimes nearing terrorism.</p><p>And as any major political and partisan event these days unfolds, the internet lit up and both sides mobilized to try and ridicule or destroy the other side.</p><p>Mobilizing many individuals for such an extended period of time takes funds, and those funds typically come in the form of donations. Thousands of people all around the world donated to the trucker movement, only for GoFundMe to <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gofundme-freedom-convoy-under-investigation-for-blocking-donations-canadian-truckers/\">block the fundraising and threaten to redirect the funds to charities of their choosing</a> (which, under pressure, they opted against in favor of reimbursing people). In response, pro-convoy members of the public started using a little known yet more open donation service: GiveSendGo.</p><p>GiveSendGo advertised itself as a free (as in freedom) donation service that would support the movement and not interfere with the donations. But it wasn’t to be: a few days after donations started to flock in, the website was exploited and hacked, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/14/freedom-convoy-donor-leak-givesendgo/\">led to the \"doxing\" of thousands of donors</a>. Their names, email addresses, ZIP codes, and IP addresses were made public. The horror! And in such a politically charged climate, one can imagine the potential impact such a leak could have on the private lives of people who donated to the trucker convoy.</p><p>No matter one's political opinion on this two-fold example, truth is that the issue it highlights is relevant to almost any heated topic, be it political or not. Financial privacy is of utmost importance in a day and age where data can be weaponized. </p><p>This tells us is that the web sorely needs to improve on two things when it comes to digital payments. One, there is a need for payments to go truly digital and trustless so that they can't be frozen, reversed, or blocked. And two, there is a clear and broad need for some payments to be accomplished anonymously to protect the personal and financial data of those making transactions.</p><h2 id=\"and-then-came-bitcoin\">And then came Bitcoin</h2><p>Bitcoin, the father of cryptocurrencies, offered us half of the solution: a revolutionary method of payment that could not be seized, frozen, reversed, or blocked.</p><p>Unfortunately, we’ve seen some very concerning events unfold in just the past few weeks – from <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/03/metamask-infura-block-certain-areas-amid-crypto-sanctions-fury/\">Ethereum service provider Infura and Metamask freezing crypto accounts</a>, to <a href=\"https://medium.com/coinmonks/as-metamask-and-opensea-abide-by-us-sanctions-the-russian-ban-is-in-the-spotlight-67611df121f8\">the so-called decentralized marketplace OpenSea blocking off users from their assets on the basis on their Russian nationality</a>. This all boils down to cryptocurrency users too often depending on centralized entities.</p><p>Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are still providing all the freedom they set out to provide; but if you use third-party services, you in effect forfeit true ownership of your coins and go back to the old patterns of not owning your money. Pro-tip: Always use non-custodial wallets and be very careful which service you send your coins to!</p><p>A question however remains: how did these companies know the identity and nationality of the owners of certain crypto addresses in the first place?</p><h2 id=\"bitcoin-often-anything-but-anonymous\">Bitcoin: Often Anything but Anonymous</h2><p>In a day and age where financial data is worth gold, Bitcoin suffers from a terrible Achille's heel: all transactions are transparent and publicly displayed on an open ledger, and all the financial data of its holders in effect become available information. And that's becoming increasingly worrying as blockchain tracing firms and crypto service providers are now in possession of very invasive and effective technology to trace Bitcoin payments.</p><p>To illustrate the sad reality of today's Bitcoin, see it this way. How would you feel walking down the street, with a picture of your bank account and credit card(s) balances stamped on your forehead? Anyone that walks past you and that is curious enough to look up would see exactly how much you own and in which account. They would also be able to see exactly with who you’ve transacted since you opened your accounts. They could see exactly what you bought, what you invested in, how much you donated to whom, a full and precise picture of your revenue and savings, and so on. Clearly, no one in their right mind would do this.</p><p>In many cases, this is precisely what Bitcoin does to your financial information now. With all the tracing tech around, combined with the need to KYC yourself to use almost any exchange or service provider, anyone curious enough can simply query the publicly available information, draft a provably accurate and very precise picture of your finances, and know exactly who's financial profile that is.</p><p>The array of people that can now know this information extends from governments and banks, to almost any corporation or private individual. A notable \"step down\" from the traditional financial system when it comes to financial privacy.</p><h2 id=\"a-good-crypto-is-a-private-crypto\">A Good Crypto is a Private Crypto</h2><p>As great as Bitcoin sounds, it is having a hard time realizing its initial vision - even after 14 years of existence - precisely because of those privacy issues. Luckily, it's not the only digital currency around.</p><p>We've seen a few cryptocurrencies focus solely on this issue of privacy, making them very good candidates to be considered as true alternatives to cash and as great settlement layers for the web of today and tomorrow.</p><p>Amongst them there is Monero, which uses the very solid RingCT privacy protocol, or Firo with its more exotic privacy setup. We also have Zcash, a very well-known privacy coin - and many others. Each of them presents a different twist to the angle of privacy and comes with different codebases, strengths, and limitations.</p><p>But privacy generally comes with concessions in flexibility. While the examples mentioned above are great alternatives to Bitcoin because of the privacy they provide, their use-case is pretty much limited to person-to-person currency transactions. And although they accomplish their purpose well, a lot of potentials is left unexploited, especially as we've seen, in recent years, the advent of \"dapps\" (distributed applications) and of Web3, a new \"take\" on the web that promises data ownership and to do away with centralized parties.</p><p>Because of the limitations of privacy coins, they, unfortunately, cannot be used in any Dapp or be an important part of Web3. And in reality, all the promises of Web3 are more or less moot if its settlement layer is not private. They will fall prey to the same issues mentioned earlier in this article - whether it is Web2 or Web3.</p><h2 id=\"a-modern-privacy-coin-fills-that-gap\">A Modern Privacy Coin Fills That Gap</h2><p>That is what motivated us to build <strong><a href=\"https://particl.io/coin\">PART</a></strong>. It is a modern privacy coin that uses the most battle-tested codebase, Bitcoin, and the most battle-tested privacy protocol, RingCT (the same privacy protocol used by Monero). But unlike other privacy coins, <strong><a href=\"https://particl.io/coin\">PART</a></strong> is built with flexibility in mind, so that it can be used in Dapps and on Web3. Case in point: PART is currently the default settlement layer of <strong><a href=\"https://particl.io/marketplace\">Particl Marketplace</a></strong>, a decentralized and private eBay-like marketplace, where one can buy and sell anything without fees, middlemen, or restrictions.</p><p>By leveraging the flexible Bitcoin codebase and adding to it solid privacy technologies, PART succeeds in fixing Bitcoin's biggest problem of financial spying, all the while being available for use as settlement for this new wave of Web3 applications. It’s basically getting the cake and eating it too.</p><p>And to add more merit to it, we've designed it in a way to be fully compatible with the Lightning Network - meaning any scalability or high fee concern that one might have with privacy coins is completely a thing of the past. PART is indeed completely private, almost infinitely scalable, and near-free to transact.</p><p>With <strong><a href=\"https://particl.io/coin\">PART</a></strong>, we intend to give you full absolute control over your money in a way that's safe and future-proof.

cryptoguard · Pull Request #25 ·\nparticl/ccs-proposalsSummaryThis proposal outlines a plan for a hard fork of\nthe\nParticl Blockchain to eliminate the decentralized treasury model, immediately\nreduce the annual inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%, and then...GitHubparticl\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25]This proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap\n[https://github.com/particl/ccs-proposals/pull/25],  proposes a hard fork for\nthe Particl Blockchain with the expressed aims of:\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nBackground and Timeline\nThe Particl project launched the Particl blockchain ($PART) in 2017 following a\n1:1 coinswap for a precursor project (Shadowcash. $SDC) plus community donations\nof Bitcoin. ​\n\nThe community raised at the time what was an equivalent of $1 million in Bitcoin\nwhich due to subsequent appreciation in BTC price became a $2-3 million runway\nto fund development of a decentralised P2P, privacy focused marketplace platform\nthat would utilise the PART token as its base currency.\n\nThe Particl project was successful and delivered the initial functional beta of\nthis marketplace in 2019.\n\nHowever the ongoing development of the product required continued funding and\nthe initial runway was being depleted.\n\nAt this point the Particl blockchain was a proof of stake blockchain and there\nwas no intrinsic method of funding for the project. The hope and aim was to\nsuccessfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the\nParticl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity\nand value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby\ndevelopers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and\nmarketing of the project.\n\nIt is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are\nvarious reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of\naccessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor\nliquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at\nthe time, being a desktop only application.\n\nUnfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did\nnot yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment\nwith the core values of the project or community.\n\nHowever the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community\nand there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.\n\nFollowing internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose\nintroduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a\npercentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.\n\nThe proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum\nsupply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of\nthis to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be\nresponsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by\non-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.\n\nThe action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development\nof the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex,\ninnovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:\n\n * The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures\n   to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable\n   outputs.​\n * The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​\n * ​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful\n   implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​\n * ​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. \n\nIt also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first\nimplementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace\n(Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. \n\nHowever there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which\nwas the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline\nin liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and\nincreased slippage.\n\nThis effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised\ntreasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned\n$PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not\naccept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and\namong many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the\npresent. ​\n\nThe minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain\nessential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50\nor significantly below this.\n\nAt the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were\nevolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART\nas a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not\nhave sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards\ngradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.\n\nSpecifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of\nthose willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers\nwho stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to\nput their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the\nproject which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply\ncentralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.\n\nFurthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides\nthey have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads\nto a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and\naccelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized\ntreasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate\nequivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).\n\nSuch structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of\ncryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my\nexperience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are\nstrongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably\nlead to centralisation of power and control.\n\nIn more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. This does\nnot mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems. Indeed my\nsupport for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the\nnetwork if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first\nexchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital\nprivacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex)\nthen the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative\nnetwork transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to\nprovide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday\nas a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high\nliquidity and intrinsic value.\n\nIndeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a hard currency i.e.\none which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation or structurally\ndeflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with\nlegitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of\nprivacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history)\nincreasing liquidity attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer\nnetworks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of\nsufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by\ncurrency inflation via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money\ncharacteristic).\n\nReasons for the Proposed Change\n> a) I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50%\nof block reward issuance) in its entirety. \nThe treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at\nwhich point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and\nremained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet\nthe basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where\ndevelopers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I\nfelt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.\n\nIndeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill\ncontinuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the\ncommunity of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring\nto the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.\n\nFor the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel\nthat whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting\ndevelopment of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only\nto accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block\nreward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is\ndetermined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of\nstructural centralisation.\n\nWhilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think\nthere is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built\ninto such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further\ntowards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.\n\nTo those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that we\nshould replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary\nmulti-currency, multisig donation pool governed by the existing CCS proposal and\nvoting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are\nwilling to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to\nsupport ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by\nthe recent successful Monero CCS proposal.\n\nI believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and\nshould be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves\ndecentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the\ncryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard\nagainst liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim\nthat the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than\na community one.\n\n> b)​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain\nimmediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level\nuntil June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031\nwhere it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until\nfurther discussion and vote to change otherwise.​\nIf we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle\nof targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the\nestimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice\nit acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the\nrespective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates\nannual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or\nsavings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).\n\nUnfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively\ncontribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this\npool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a\nlarger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available\ncurrency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets\nand other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate\npassive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more\nlikely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further\ncapital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to\noutcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because\nthey are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active\nparticipants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing\nwealth inequality) over time.\n\nAs the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional\nmiddle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay\nrises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to\nthe equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of\nspending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn\nadversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I\nargue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity\nrestriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure\nthey are involved in building and maintaining.\n\nIn contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion\nof all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of\nhands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and\nrestricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via\nreal terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor\nmanagement of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.\n\nWith no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued\nfiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money” i.e. money which due\nto continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value\nper unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active\nparticipants and contributors in its economy.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis\nand its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our\ninflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences\nthat were to come. They created Bitcoin intended as “hard money” i.e. a currency\nwith a fixed hard cap in supply.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin is undoubtedly expected to become hard money around 2140 (when\nall 21 million Bitcoin in the current protocol will have been mined) this\nassumes that there will be no protocol changes to Bitcoin that break this limit\ne.g. tail emission or change in total fixed supply. \n\nFurthermore at the present time, Bitcoin continues to be reliant on the issuance\nof new Bitcoin via mining in order to guarantee its security budget. Thus at\nthis present time it is dependent on supply inflation and so it presently\nbehaves as soft money (even though it is expected to become hard money in the\nfuture). \n\nAlmost all known Proof of stake systems are reliant on issuance of new coins to\nincentivize staking with the minting of new coins used to pay for their security\nbudgets.\n\nThus all cryptocurrencies in current existence that have any form of ongoing\nsupply issuance and inflation by my definition represent soft money and are\ninherently vulnerable to the problems I have outlined with other forms of soft\nmoney.\n\nIf we were to scrap our decentralized treasury model today, the PA inflation\nrate of the Particl Blockchain would remain at 7% per annum in perpetuity. This\nis 3.5 times the targeted inflation rate of central banks. This would make $PART\na soft currency in perpetuity with an inflation equivalent annual devaluation in\nintrinsic value worse than the currencies of most central banks.\n\nWe should not be a central bank, we certainly should not be performing 3.5x\nworse than them.\n\nParticl should not remain a soft currency in perpetuity. We should be actively\ntargeting transformation into hard money.\n\nAt present, Particl is a proof of stake blockchain with the security budget\ngenerated by:\n\n * Network transaction fees\n * New token issuance (determined by per annum supply inflation).\n\nStaking $PART tokens on the Particl blockchain locks them out of active\ncirculation on the Particl network. In return stakers are rewarded with new\ntokens generated by a combination of network transaction fees plus new tokens\nminted into circulation as a result of programmed network token supply increases\n- rewards and network security is thus currently subsidized by\nnew token issuance (supply inflation).\n\nIn many ways the current proof of stake implementation resembles the mechanism\nof asset hoarding and yield accumulation for speculative investment purposes\nthat we see with fiat currencies issued by central banks. Stakers buy the token\nfor yield with the expectation that the value of the underlying tokens staked\nwill either remain stable or appreciate over time as liquidity in the network\ngrows.\n\nStaking coins are however not actively changing hands, thus they are not\nactively exchanging economic value thus they are not generating liquidity.\nStaking may serve to restrict circulating supply and inflate the intrinsic value\nof circulating coins as the value transacted on the network increases however\nparadoxically the reward for doing this is distributed to coin balances that are\nessentially static i.e. not participating in or driving the network activity\nthat brings intrinsic value\nto the network.\n\nSo if Particl as proof of stake currency mechanisms is currently predisposed\ntowards soft money characteristics and outcomes, how do we successfully\ntransform a Particl as a Proof of Stake currency into hard money?\n\nSimple: we focus on increasing network transaction fee revenue by increasing the\nfrequency and amount of value transacted on the Particl network whilst actively\nreducing new token issuance.\n\nFortunately, this is already possible Particl ecosystem already has two key\napplications that could achieve this with some suggested mechanisms:\n\nBasicSwapDex (BSX)\n * Generation of network fees by using $PART as an intermediary token to\n   facilitate otherwise impossible atomic swaps (between two coins that both\n   lack programmable outputs e.g. XMR:LTC MWEB)​\n * ​Implementation of a PART fee for swap transactions done via select third\n   party\n   integrations of BSX. This fee should ideally be an automatic buy (on swap)\n   with send to burn address to generate automated buy side liquidity for the\n   PART token, counteracting the impact of any supply side inflation as well as\n   generating a network transaction fee that can be redistributed to stakers.\n\nParticl Marketplace\n * Network transaction fees generated via use of the MAD escrow to secure funds\n   utilised in purchasing goods and services.​\n * ​Network transaction fees for any other service or smart contract operating\n   on the Particl Marketplace to facilitate economic activity of any kind.\n\nIn any event passing this proposal would put the onus on both the development\nteam and Particl community to actively accelerate adoption of the Particl\nnetwork otherwise their staking rewards will diminish over time. They are\neffectively racing against declining issuance rewards over time as the annual\nsupply inflation reward decreases.\n\nI note that this proposal suggests gradually bringing the per annum inflation\nrate to 1.0%. This means that unless token burn mechanisms are in place that\nresult in an annual burn rate greater than 1.0% then Particl will remain a soft\ncurrency.\n\nIt is my hope that we will use this time (approximately next 6 years) to focus\non increasing network activity, network adoption and scalability to create an L1\nsystem whose network fees sufficient to justify enough network staking to\nadequately and appropriately secure the network. Even if we are not successful\nin that regard, leaving the inflation rate at 1.0% per annum provides us with\nadditional time to focus on these areas whilst remaining harder money\nthan traditional central bank issued currencies and indeed most other\ncryptocurrencies currently traded today.\n\nRegardless it is my hope that if this proposal is passed, that if our community\nis active and focuses appropriately then by 2031 we will be in a position to\nfurther propose reducing our per annum inflation rate from 1.0% in perpetuity to\n0% in perpetuity which would allow us to become a proof of stake cryptocurrency\nfunded entirely by network transaction fees and have a native currency that\nsatisfies my definition of “hard money”.\n\nTimeline\n * Voting opens: Est. July, 2025\n * Implementation: Upon successful vote (75% approval rate with minimum quorum\n   of 20% of the total supply over 10,080 blocks) and subsequent hard fork.\n\nImpact\nIf approved, this change will:\n\n * Significantly reduce PART's inflation rate from 7% to 3.5%;\n * Reduce PART’s inflation rate by 0.5% every year until it reaches 1.0%;\n * Remove the network treasury;\n * Initiate a hard fork of the Particl blockchain.\n\nWe believe this proposal represents a positive step toward optimizing the\nParticl network's economic model while ensuring sustainable project development\nand incentivising our community to actively promote and grow the\nnetwork.Important: For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are\nrunning its latest version.

The hope and aim was to successfully spur sufficient adoption of the Particl Marketplace to provide the Particl token with sufficient organic, speculative and non-speculative liquidity and value thus that donations and staking rewards from the PART heldby developers and the community would be sufficient to fund further development and marketing of the project.</p><p>It is fair to say that the project was not successful in that regard. There are various reasons for this but I would say the primary ones were the lack of accessibility for the native PART token resulting in a persistent state of poor liquidity and the intrinsic limited accessibility of the Particl Marketplace at the time, being a desktop only application.</p><p>Unfortunately further attempts to secure external funding for the project did not yield any offers that we felt would be satisfactory or in suitable alignment with the core values of the project or community.</p><p>However the intrinsic value of the project remained understood by our community and there remained a strong desire to see the project succeed.</p><p>Following internal and subsequent community discussion it was decided to propose introduction of a decentralised treasury model that would be funded by a percentage of the block reward on the Particl Blockchain.</p><p>The proposal voted on and passed by the community agreed to raise per annum supply inflation from 2% to 8% (which would eventually fall to 6 and for 50% of this to be automatically diverted to the treasury. The community would be responsible for how these funds raised were spent and this would be settled by on-chain voting by those who were actively staking on the Particl blockchain.</p><p>The action by the community to support this proposal enabled ongoing development of the Particl Project. This resulted in the creation of BasicSwapDex, innovations in the atomic swap and DEX technology, specifically:</p><ul><li>The first implementation of (semi)scriptless scripts via adaptor signatures to permit atomic swaps with XMR and other coins that lacked programmable outputs.​</li><li>The first successful implementation of unidirectional XMR atomic swaps.​</li><li>​Further development via our SMSG network to support the first successful<br>implementation of bidirectional atomic swaps.​</li><li>​The world’s first fully decentralised distributed order book DEX. </li></ul><p>It also allowed us to further research and develop the worlds first implementation of AI LLM flagging of listings on a decentralised marketplace (Particl Marketplace) to aid community moderation of content listed on it. </p><p>However there were more general problems. The Particl Project token $PART which was the primary currency of the Particl network suffered through ongoing decline in liquidity with falling daily trading volumes, falling spot prices and increased slippage.</p><p>This effectively led to a functional decline in the utility of the decentralised treasury as Particl developers needed to periodically liquidate their earned $PART in order to cover costs of living (unfortunately tax authorities do not accept direct payment in $PART) which in turn contributed to sell pressure and among many other causes created a death spiral in liquidity from 2019 to the present. ​</p><p>The minimum value of $PART needed to remain equivalent at $0.80 to sustain essential development but for much of 2019 to the present it has traded at $0.50 or significantly below this.</p><p>At the same time my own views and insights on privacy and economies were evolving. I increasingly came to see the death spiral in the liquidity of $PART as a problem structurally inherent to most proof of stake systems that do not have sufficient distribution and base liquidity; there is a tendency towards gradual centralisation of supply to fewer and fewer individuals.</p><p>Specifically this is because as price falls, sentiment decreases, the pool of those willing to buy decreases, people then sell to a shrinking pool of buyers who stake the supply to accumulate further. These stakers are less inclined to put their holdings up for sale since they believe in the future value of the project which ironically kills liquidity further and reinforces the supply centralisation tendency and liquidity doom loop.</p><p>Furthermore, this doom loop accelerates when the limited pool of buyers decides they have accumulated enough and simply choose to continue staking. This leads to a death in buy pressure on the token which leads to a continued and accelerating fall in price (as those earning $PART from the decentralized treasury are forced to sell larger amounts into the market to generate equivalent fiat revenue to cover their core living expenses).</p><p>Such structural tendencies are also unappealing to a demographic of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who recognise these tendencies. In particular in my experience the majority of cryptocurrency users who are privacy conscious are strongly opposed to any systems of economics or governance that may conceivably lead to centralisation of power and control.</p><p>In more recent years, I have fallen much more strongly into this camp. <strong>This does not mean that I am inherently opposed to all proof of stake systems</strong>. Indeed my support for the Particl Project at its core lies in my realisation that the network if properly utilised as a marketplace for the KYC free, privacy first exchange of goods and services (via the Particl Marketplace) and as the digital privacy forex of choice for privacy focused cryptocurrencies (via BasicSwapDex) then <strong>the Particl network can easily generate liquidity through non-speculative network transactions fees in a manner not dependent on supply inflation to provide an adequate security budget i.e. it could potentially function someday as a proof of stake network with 0% supply inflation with extremely high liquidity and intrinsic value.</strong></p><p>Indeed I think this type of network would turn $PART into a <strong>hard currency i.e. one which I define as a currency with 0% supply inflation</strong> or structurally deflationary. This hard currency characteristic operating on a network with legitimate and attractive non-speculative usage options (the guarantee of privacy and protection from third party snooping of financial history) increasing liquidity <strong>attracting liquidity from other value storage/transfer networks (fiat and cryptocurrency) to generate transaction fees and frequency of sufficient value to justify staking with a reward that is not subsidized by currency inflation</strong> via the printing of new coin supply (a soft money characteristic).</p><h2 id=\"reasons-for-the-proposed-change\">Reasons for the Proposed Change</h2><blockquote><strong>a)</strong> I propose we scrap the decentralised treasury model (subsidized/funded by 50% of block reward issuance) in its entirety. </blockquote><p>The treasury did sustain development of the Particl Project from 2019 to 2022 at which point the market liquidity and value of the $PART token had fallen to and remained at a point where the revenue generated was no longer sufficient to meet the basic needs of the Particl development team. This led to a situation where developers were requesting community donations in other cryptocurrencies and I felt there were periods of noticeable delay in product development.</p><p>Indeed, during this period until 2023 the team was operating on goodwill continuing to develop the project out of a shared understanding with the community of the privacy first, cypherpunk ideology they were helping to bring to the world and the incalculable intrinsic value of that.</p><p>For the reasons I have already outlined in the background and timeline, I feel that whilst it initially worked and served its intended purpose (supporting development of the project), the treasury model employed eventually served only to accelerate the decline in liquidity of the Particl blockchain as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, explaining to people discovering the project that 50% of the block reward is centralised to a single fund (even if spending from the fund is determined by community vote) can leave the project open to accusations of structural centralisation.</p><p>Whilst I think more severe forms of this accusation can be disputed, I do think there is some fundamental validity to this idea (trust assumptions are built into such a funding method) and I believe it would steer the project further towards true decentralisation by scrapping this type of funding method entirely.</p><p>To those who ask where our funding should come from? I would argue that <strong>we should replace the current treasury model with a purely voluntary multi-currency, multisig donation pool</strong> governed by the existing CCS proposal and voting system. We have clear evidence that communities other than our own are willing to contribute to and donate funds in the currency of their choice to support ongoing development of work by the Particl Project as demonstrated by the recent successful Monero CCS proposal.</p><p>I believe that this can be replicated and that the Particl Project can and should be funded via a multi-currency voluntary donation model as this preserves decentralisation, focuses the onus of consent on users, actively supports the cryptoagnostic ideology of the project, provides choice and helps safeguard against liquidity shocks for any single given currency whilst removing any claim that the Particl Blockchain is in anyway a corporate run blockchain rather than a community one.</p><blockquote><strong>b)</strong>​ I am proposing that the per annum inflation rate of the Particl Blockchain immediately fall from the current level of 7% to 3.5% and remain at this level until June 2026 at which point it will fall by 0.5% every year until June 2031 where it would be expected to reach 1.0% at which level it will remain until further discussion and vote to change otherwise.​</blockquote><p>If we look at traditional central banking orthodoxy, they follow the principle of targeting inflation rate of 2% annually. Whilst this is in reference to the estimated average percentage rise in the cost of goods and services, in practice it acts as a compounding devaluator of any person who simply stores the respective issued currencies of any central bank in a medium that generates annual yield below this targeted inflation rate (e.g. cash under the mattress or savings accounts paying below the annual inflation rate).</p><p>Unfortunately such a system serves to typically hit those who most actively contribute to an economy i.e. the working and professional middle classes; this pool of participants in an economy are more likely to be reliant and/or have a larger proportion of their asset wealth locked up as cash in savings.</p><p>At the same time the wealthiest in society often have the most available currency on hand and are more able to invest in stocks, bonds, property markets and other forms of asset accumulation beyond cash as savings that generate passive yield at rates above annual inflation. Because the wealthiest are more likely to hold more assets of value they have an easier time raising further capital via provision of these assets as collateral and are thus able to outcompete working and middle class individuals on a 1:1 level simply because they are performing at scales inaccessible to the majority of active participants in an economy; this guarantees centralisation of liquidity (growing wealth inequality) over time.</p><p>As the period from 2008 to 2022 demonstrated, for many working and professional middle classes the interest rate on their savings and the percentage annual pay rises consistently fell below their national annual rate of inflation leading to the equivalent of year on year real terms pay cuts and real terms devaluation of spending power of savings reducing their overall financialsecurity which in turn adversely impacted their social mobility, health, mental state and thus (I argue) their creativity and productivity via the equivalent of a liquidity restriction on active participants in an economy in all of the infrastructure they are involved in building and maintaining.</p><p>In contrast, despite the total size of the economy growing, a greater proportion of all wealth generated globally is flowing into an ever decreasing number of hands. Liquidity is not being distributed, it is effectively being locked and restricted which has created growing social instability and societal decay via real terms shrinking expenditure on services and core infrastructure.</p><p>In addition to this the printing of money is controlled by central banks. Poor management of issuance by them can lead to sudden, sharp currency devaluations.</p><p><strong>With no fixed hard cap on total currency supply, all current central bank issued fiat currencies represent to me what I term, “soft money”</strong> i.e. money which due to continued issuance in perpetuity is guaranteed to lose its intrinsic value per unit over time and thus gradually penalise and destabilise the most active participants and contributors in its economy.</p><p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a direct response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and its original creators clearly saw the structural problems with our inflationary, fiat banking soft money system and understood the consequences that were to come.
