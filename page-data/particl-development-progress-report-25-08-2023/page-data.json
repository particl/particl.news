You can monitor these changes\nby visiting this link [https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]\n.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nExploring New Coin Additions ?\nThis week, we've continued the process of exploring new coins for inclusion on\nBasicSwap and started working on a few integrations.\n\nIn the process, we've encountered unique challenges that necessitated\nimprovements to the BasicSwap codebase. Inded, while the Particl blockchain can\ninterpret transactions from various coins, the reverse isn't always true for\nsome of the coins we're aiming to integrate. Given that BasicSwap was initially\ndesigned for a swift launch with the initial coin release lineup we had at that\ntime, certain assets we're considering now aren't fully compatible with specific\naspects of the existing codebase. \n\nConsequently, we've now opted to embed additional functionalities directly into\nBasicSwap to ensure broader cryptocurrency compatibility moving forward. While\nthese modifications aren't too extensive or expected to become time-consuming,\nthey have been a focal point of our work this week.\n\nUser Interface ?️\nIn addition to the minor cosmetic updates highlighted in last week's report, \nwe've begun refining the New Offer page. Our aim is to streamline the user\nexperience by tucking most advanced options into a collapsible menu and focusing\ninstead on what coins, and what amounts, users want to swap. \n\nThis approach ensures a quicker and more intuitive interface, preventing users\nfrom being overwhelmed by technical choices. However, these options remain\neasily accessible for advanced users who seek them.\n\nPrepare Your Nodes, Voting Starts Tuesday ?️ \nTeam Funding Proposal #4Learn all the details about the Particl team’s fourth\nfunding request from the Treasury Fund.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/team-funding-proposal-4/]Last week, we have published a\nfourth funding request to ensure the continued growth of the Particl project and\nto support the wide-ranging operations of the team.\n\nWe can now announce that voting will start next Tuesday and last from block \n1,493,000 to block 1,498,039, for a total of 5,040 blocks.\n\nBecause this proposal does not propose changes to the protocol, it will require\na participation rate of 20% or more of the total supply and an approval rate of\n60% or more to be considered valid.\n\n> Note: The accompanying CCS page of the proposal should be up in the next couple\nof hours, after which we'll publish a standalone blog post announcing the voting\nparameters and instructions on Particl News.\nHow to Vote ℹ️\nTo cast your vote for this proposal, we recommend using the partyman cold\nstaking application and register your vote on the blockchain for proposal #19. \n\nYou have the options to abstain (0), vote in favor (1), or vote against (2).\nEvery vote matters, and we strongly encourage you to participate as a higher\nparticipation rate means a broader consensus and healthier decision-making\nprocess for the whole community.\n\n * To learn more about Particl's on-chain voting system, click here\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/particl-blockchain/blockchain_governance.html]\n   .\n * To learn how to vote, refer to this tutorial\n   [https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/part-guides/partguides_voting.html].\n * For the CCS voting page of this proposal, head over here\n   [https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/team-funding-request-4.html].\n\n> Important: For the proposal to show up on Partyman, make sure you are running\nthe latest version of Partyman.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult. We are energized by your approval and look forward to more community\nproposals in the future.\n\nYour commitment to the vision and your continued support drive us forward.\nNothing would be possible without you.\n\n- The Particl Team\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News. Moving forward, we'll\nbe publishing BasicSwap-related development updates on BasicSwap's blog (\nblog.basicswapdex.com [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/]) following a development\ncycle schedule.\n\nThis transition means fewer but more comprehensive updates. Rather than\npublishing weekly updates, we'll create detailed progress reports that are\nupdated dynamically throughout each development cycle.\n\nOur goal is to make essential information more accessible, eliminating the need\nto search through multiple weekly blog posts to find details about specific\nfeatures we mentioned weeks earlier.\n\nPlease note that BasicSwap's blog operates on our custom-built, open-source\nplatform, with posts written in MDX format. This provides exceptional\nflexibility and control over how the information is presented, with much more\nengaging and relevant content.\n\nWe strongly recommend bookmarking our new blog platform and visiting the June\n2025 update [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/] immediately for\na comprehensive, detailed progress report on BasicSwap DEX.\n\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard Money ?️\nCCS Proposal — The Road to Hard MoneyRead the full CCS proposal from Dr. Kap\nthat suggests disabling treasury rewards and reducing the network’s emission\nrate.Particl Newscryptoguard\n[https://particl.news/ccs-proposal-disable-treasury-rewards-and-reduce-emission-rate/]\nA CCS proposal, authored by community member and Particl advisor Dr. Kap, was\npublished this week and proposes a hard fork for the Particl Blockchain with the\nexpressed aims of...\n\n * Removing the decentralised treasury model which currently directs 50% of the\n   block reward to a community managed fund that has been used to support\n   development of the Particl project since 2019.\n * Immediately lower the current per annum inflation rate of the Particl\n   blockchain from 7% to 3.5% until June 2026. ​\n * Further lower the per per annum inflation rate by 0.5% per year over the\n   following 5 year period until the per annum inflation rate is 1.0% (June\n   2031).\n * To initiate a further community discussion and protocol vote around the time\n   per annum inflation is 1.0% to decide if this should be further lowered to 0%\n   and if so how.\n\nThe proposal is still in its discussion phase, and an official announcement\nregarding the start of the voting period will be communicated shortly. If you\nhave any comments or feedback, we invite you to share them directly on the\nproposal or within the community.\n\nBasicSwap at the 2025 Litecoin Summit ?\n2025 Litecoin Summit\nThe 2025 Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas was a tremendous success. We were honored\nto be invited to speak at the event, and BasicSwap advisor Dr. Kap did an\nexcellent job explaining our focus on making atomic swap technology as\naccessible as possible, with the ultimate goal of matching or even surpassing\nthe user experience of centralized exchanges.\n\nPart of our strategy involves making BasicSwap stable and reliable enough as a\nprotocol for integration into user-friendly third-party platforms, such as\nLitecoin's new Nexus wallet or Cake Wallet.\n\nWhile we're still working on solidifying the base protocol and delivering on the\nmilestones set in Monero's CCS proposal, we're excited to start planning the\nnext phase. We're thrilled to have met great partners and community members at\nthe Litecoin Summit who are willing to integrate BasicSwap and/or provide\nmuch-needed liquidity to the order book.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Kap's presentation, available on YouTube:\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kap participated in the \"Panel on Privacy\" with industry\nleaders including David Burkett (MWEB Developer at Litecoin Foundation), Justin\nBerman (Developer at Monero), and Joël Valenzuela (Business Development and\nMarketing at Dash).\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Open-Source Revolution\nWe're on a mission to create a private, independent, and pro-liberty digital\neconomy that is fair and open to all.

basicswap/basicswapGitHubbasicswap\n[https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/311]Following last week's release\nof the MVP for multi-net capabilities using Simplex as the first alternative\nnetwork, we've identified several Simplex-specific issues that we're currently\nworking to resolve.\n\nDue to Simplex's complex and intricate network architecture, these issues are\nproving challenging to address, requiring additional development time.
