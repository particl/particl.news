This new report\ncontains a lot of information about the status of the project’s development as\nwell as a pretty good presentation of the features that are most likely to be\nincluded in the Beta version of Particl Marketplace.\n\nWhat We Are Busy With\nThis section of the report shows what the Particl development team is already\nworking on. These items are currently under active development and are the\nprimary short-term focus points of our developers.\n\nMarketplace\nAs many of you already know, the team is currently heavily focused on developing\nand putting together both the project and marketplace governance systems.\n\nDecentralized Project GovernanceThe project governance system\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1087] will allow users to\ncreate and submit proposals for the community to vote on. These proposals will\nbe extremely useful to reach consensus within the community in a provably fair\nfashion. This proposal system is required for the community to vote on what to\ndo with the remaining funds in the Community Initiative Fund\n[https://www.kialo.com/invited?token=005-7c0b9545-ef61-4b50-a65d-205fe37fc65e] \n(~33,000 PART, 100% community-owned).\n\nThe marketplace governance system, on the other hand, is the function that\nallows users to flag undesirable content on Particl Marketplace. As no party\nother than the community itself has moderation powers over the marketplace, this\nfeature is considered an absolute requirement for the marketplace DApp to be\nreleased on mainnet. Indeed, this mechanism gives community moderation powers\nover the content posted on it so that it can stay clean and free of\nreprehensible or spammy content.\n\nAside from both governance systems, there is also quite a few improvements being\nmade to the marketplace based on the various feedback we’ve received from all of\nthe people who have tested the Alpha version. This includes the refactoring of\nseveral aspects of the code, making it much smoother, faster, and intuitive to\nuse, and a few new feature enhancements such as advanced filtering options and\nexpiry time on listed products.\n\nA few items here are actually quite interesting. In fact, the team is currently\nworking on a new hardware wallet integration, Trezor, to give users more options\nwhen it comes to secure storage of funds.\n\nMulti-Wallets\nA major and long-awaited Particl Desktop feature has also started being worked\non [https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1096], namely multi-wallets.\nThis function enables the possibility to set up several different wallets within\nthe same Particl Desktop instance. This is a great feature for both security,\nprivacy, and usability.\n\nTwo Different Wallets Within the Same Particl Desktop InstanceMulti-wallets\nallow users to segment their entire profiles and eliminate the risk of\nmismanaging personal data through isolation. In fact, multi-wallets can be seen\nas different “accounts” within the same application (Particl Desktop), each\nwallet having its own set of addresses, transaction history, marketplace\nprofiles and wallet parameters (i.e. cold staking keys). In other words, there\nis no data being shared between each wallet, and when switching between them,\nthe previous wallet’s data is entirely purged before even loading the other\nwallet. This isolation and data purging process makes it impossible for any type\nof data to leak between different wallets even if they are running from the same\nParticl Desktop instance.\n\nThis feature will be crucial for users to create different marketplace profiles\nor accounts (i.e. a buyer and a vendor account) and will make not mixing\nmarketplace activity and personal finances a very easy and foolproof process.\nUsers can also get creative and use this feature for all sorts of purposes, one\nof them being the easy “budgeting” of one’s staking revenues.\n\nIndeed, multi-wallets make possible to set a different staking node per wallet,\neven if they are operated from the same Particl Desktop instance. Then, each\nstaking node can be set up in such a way that it sends staking rewards to a\ndifferent address (as in, not to the same addresses actively staking) per\nwallet. That way, stakers can easily budget their staking earnings by\nredirecting their rewards to various different addresses at the percentage they\nwant (i.e. 50% sent to a savings address, 25% sent to a “vacation fund”, and the\nother 25% sent as a donation to a Community Fund used to fund and develop\nprojects on the Particl network).\n\nTrezor Integration\nTrezor Hardware WalletWe’re currently working on the Ledger Wallet integration,\nbut we’re not stopping there. With the goal of providing our users with more\nflexibility by making more options available, we can announce that we have\nstarted working on an integration to the Trezor hardware wallet\n[https://trezor.io/]!\n\n> Trezor is a single purpose device which allows you to make secure Bitcoin\ntransactions. With Trezor, transactions are completely safe even when initiated\non a compromised or vulnerable computer. Because the use of Trezor is very easy\nand intuitive we believe it will help Bitcoin adoption among people not familiar\nwith the security issues. —https://wiki.trezor.io/FAQ:Overview\nWaiting for Review\nA few items have been completed and are awaiting the final review before being\nintegrated. Actually, all the Particl Desktop items listed as “Waiting for\nReview”, that is, the cold staking widget as well as the user interface upgrade,\nhave been completed and are already part of our Particl Desktop 1.2.2 mainnet\npre-release. The rest of the “Waiting for Review” items should be integrated\nsoon, namely the location selector for better price structuring, the proposal\nscreen and notification system for order status changes.\n\nWhat’s on the Horizon — Beta\nThis section is probably the most interesting as it reveals the projected items\nfor the Beta version of Particl Marketplace. These listed items are indeed what\nthe Beta will most likely include and paints a clear picture of what the\ndevelopment team will be working in the short to mid-term.\n\nMulti-Wallets\nAs pointed above, multi-wallets are already under active development and are\ngoing to be a big part of the marketplace’s security, privacy, and usability.\n\nStarting Particl Desktop Without the Marketplace\nThis simple feature will allow people to launch Particl Desktop in wallet mode\nonly when one doesn’t wish to use the marketplace. This will make Particl\nDesktop more lightweight in terms of resources required from the device you’re\nlaunching it from (~400mb less memory required).\n\nPrivate Markets & Listings\nPrivate markets are unindexed marketplaces within the Particl network. These\nmarkets are not going to be accessible or readable from the public interface of\nParticl Marketplace and will instead require users to input a unique key or link\n(usually provided by the market creator).\n\nPrivate listings are listings displayed only in private markets that, just like\nprivate markets, cannot be accessed by using the public interface of the market\nunless a special key or link is entered by the user. These private listings\nintend on emulating face-to-face transactions such as what you would do if you\nwere to sell an item or service to a personal friend in exchange for cash money.\n\nWhile these private listings can still be moderated out by the community if they\nare deemed undesirable, the fact that they are private and can only be accessed\nwith a custom key will make them very hard to even reach the flagging threshold\nin order to be deleted. It could be expected that the only way a private listing\nwould be delisted by the community is if the undesirable content becomes very\npopular and its private key leaks to the Particl stakers.\n\nEscrow Enhancements & Deposit Negotiations\nThe decentralized MAD escrow system is one of the major aspects of Particl\nMarketplace and will, of course, undergo several enhancement phases. One of the\nvery obvious enhancements being worked into the escrow is the full integration\nof the RingCT privacy protocol, which has recently been academically reviewed by\nthe NJIT Department of Technology and audited by the WSA cybersecurity firm.\nOther enhancements include, but are not limited to, the user experience, its\nstability, the possibility to adjust the security deposit amount percentage, and\nmore.\n\nParticl Desktop Settings Page\nAnother needed feature for both the marketplace and the Particl Desktop client\nis a settings page. This page will allow users to set up their profiles as well\nas various Particl Desktop wide features. This Settings page will be an\never-evolving section of Particl Desktop and will integrate more and more\noptions as the Particl platform grows.\n\nParticl Software Development Kit\nAnother long-awaited and exciting feature is the Particl SDK: a development\ntoolkit that will allow any developer to easily build decentralized\napplications, widgets, and features on the Particl network. We fully expect the\nrelease of this SDK to mark an important turn in the Particl project, one where\noutside developers will be able to grow the Particl platform on their own. We\nfully intend on organizing hack-a-thons and development contests using Particl’s\nSDK, and firmly believe the release of this toolkit will cement Particl as a\nsolid decentralized application platform.\n\nDecentralized Funding & Decentralized Organizations on Particl\nCombining multi-wallets and the Particl SDK will allow people to request\nfundings from Particl stakers for any kind of development actively benefiting\nthe Particl network. While still a few months away from being a real\npossibility, any outside/third-party development team will be able to submit\nformal proposals to the Particl network and request stakers to passively donate\na portion of their staking rewards to a development fund.\n\nThis funding model is quite different than the now popular ICO model, as it\ndoesn’t automatically secure an upfront amount of money to a development team,\ninstead providing a steady but more reasonable stream of funds. This ensures the\ndevelopment teams stay motivated and incentivized to develop the product that\nthey promised the community, which is even truer when the funding itself can be\ncut at any moment by the stakers (they only need to stop redirecting their\nstaking rewards to this project’s development fund).\n\nThis form of funding model also encourages developers to build products that are\nbeneficial to the entire Particl ecosystem itself. That is because decentralized\napplications on Particl will work using the PART coin, at least initially, and\ndo not allow developers to create tokens for themselves and disregard the\nParticl ecosystem as a whole. This is true for stakers as well, redirecting\ntheir staking rewards to a project’s development fund does not award them with\nany kind of token, therefore they will want to donate to projects that are going\nto be directly beneficial to the Particl platform, coin, and ecosystem.\n\nStay Tuned!\nThere is so much development being made on Particl right now, stay tuned for\nmore detailed updates about each of the aforementioned items as they near\nmainnet or testnet implementation. The Status Report is always a good way to\nkeep yourself up-to-date with all development updates surrounding the project.\nDon’t forget to also take a look at our Github page, especially the Pull Request\ntabs of each of our repositories.","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/New-Status-Report-Released/1-shG0fKUWbiPYc27Fahxn-Q.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>If you haven’t noticed yet, <a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\">a new development Status Report has recently been posted on our website</a>.

This is a great feature for both security, privacy, and usability.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/New-Status-Report-Released/1-Qo-jqiEtrW8sAEbyAJNGCg.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Two Different Wallets Within the Same Particl Desktop Instance</figcaption></figure><p>Multi-wallets allow users to segment their entire profiles and eliminate the risk of mismanaging personal data through isolation. In fact, multi-wallets can be seen as different “accounts” within the same application (Particl Desktop), each wallet having its own set of addresses, transaction history, marketplace profiles and wallet parameters (i.e. cold staking keys). In other words, there is no data being shared between each wallet, and when switching between them, the previous wallet’s data is entirely purged before even loading the other wallet. This isolation and data purging process makes it impossible for any type of data to leak between different wallets even if they are running from the same Particl Desktop instance.</p><p>This feature will be crucial for users to create different marketplace profiles or accounts (i.e. a buyer and a vendor account) and will make not mixing marketplace activity and personal finances a very easy and foolproof process. Users can also get creative and use this feature for all sorts of purposes, one of them being the easy “budgeting” of one’s staking revenues.</p><p>Indeed, multi-wallets make possible to set a different staking node per wallet, even if they are operated from the same Particl Desktop instance. Then, each staking node can be set up in such a way that it sends staking rewards to a different address (as in, not to the same addresses actively staking) per wallet. That way, stakers can easily budget their staking earnings by redirecting their rewards to various different addresses at the percentage they want (i.e. 50% sent to a savings address, 25% sent to a “vacation fund”, and the other 25% sent as a donation to a Community Fund used to fund and develop projects on the Particl network).</p><h3 id=\"trezor-integration\">Trezor Integration</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/New-Status-Report-Released/1-VhiG1xJJr_vYYsJczTCLyw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Trezor Hardware Wallet</figcaption></figure><p>We’re currently working on the Ledger Wallet integration, but we’re not stopping there. With the goal of providing our users with more flexibility by making more options available, we can announce that we have started working on an integration to the <a href=\"https://trezor.io/\">Trezor hardware wallet</a>!</p><blockquote>Trezor is a single purpose device which allows you to make secure Bitcoin transactions. With Trezor, transactions are completely safe even when initiated on a compromised or vulnerable computer.

Actually, all the Particl Desktop items listed as “Waiting for Review”, that is, the cold staking widget as well as the user interface upgrade, have been completed and are already part of our Particl Desktop 1.2.2 mainnet pre-release. The rest of the “Waiting for Review” items should be integrated soon, namely the location selector for better price structuring, the proposal screen and notification system for order status changes.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-on-the-horizon-beta\">What’s on the Horizon — Beta</h2><p>This section is probably the most interesting as it reveals the projected items for the Beta version of Particl Marketplace. These listed items are indeed what the Beta will most likely include and paints a clear picture of what the development team will be working in the short to mid-term.</p><h3 id=\"multi-wallets-1\">Multi-Wallets</h3><p>As pointed above, multi-wallets are already under active development and are going to be a big part of the marketplace’s security, privacy, and usability.</p><h3 id=\"starting-particl-desktop-without-the-marketplace\">Starting Particl Desktop Without the Marketplace</h3><p>This simple feature will allow people to launch Particl Desktop in wallet mode only when one doesn’t wish to use the marketplace. This will make Particl Desktop more lightweight in terms of resources required from the device you’re launching it from (~400mb less memory required).</p><h3 id=\"private-markets-listings\">Private Markets &amp; Listings</h3><p>Private markets are unindexed marketplaces within the Particl network. These markets are not going to be accessible or readable from the public interface of Particl Marketplace and will instead require users to input a unique key or link (usually provided by the market creator).</p><p>Private listings are listings displayed only in private markets that, just like private markets, cannot be accessed by using the public interface of the market unless a special key or link is entered by the user. These private listings intend on emulating face-to-face transactions such as what you would do if you were to sell an item or service to a personal friend in exchange for cash money.</p><p>While these private listings can still be moderated out by the community if they are deemed undesirable, the fact that they are private and can only be accessed with a custom key will make them very hard to even reach the flagging threshold in order to be deleted. It could be expected that the only way a private listing would be delisted by the community is if the undesirable content becomes very popular and its private key leaks to the Particl stakers.</p><h3 id=\"escrow-enhancements-deposit-negotiations\">Escrow Enhancements &amp; Deposit Negotiations</h3><p>The decentralized MAD escrow system is one of the major aspects of Particl Marketplace and will, of course, undergo several enhancement phases. One of the very obvious enhancements being worked into the escrow is the full integration of the RingCT privacy protocol, which has recently been academically reviewed by the NJIT Department of Technology and audited by the WSA cybersecurity firm. Other enhancements include, but are not limited to, the user experience, its stability, the possibility to adjust the security deposit amount percentage, and more.</p><h3 id=\"particl-desktop-settings-page\">Particl Desktop Settings Page</h3><p>Another needed feature for both the marketplace and the Particl Desktop client is a settings page. This page will allow users to set up their profiles as well as various Particl Desktop wide features. This Settings page will be an ever-evolving section of Particl Desktop and will integrate more and more options as the Particl platform grows.</p><h2 id=\"particl-software-development-kit\">Particl Software Development Kit</h2><p>Another long-awaited and exciting feature is the Particl SDK: a development toolkit that will allow any developer to easily build decentralized applications, widgets, and features on the Particl network. We fully expect the release of this SDK to mark an important turn in the Particl project, one where outside developers will be able to grow the Particl platform on their own. We fully intend on organizing hack-a-thons and development contests using Particl’s SDK, and firmly believe the release of this toolkit will cement Particl as a solid decentralized application platform.</p><h3 id=\"decentralized-funding-decentralized-organizations-on-particl\">Decentralized Funding &amp; Decentralized Organizations on Particl</h3><p>Combining multi-wallets and the Particl SDK will allow people to request fundings from Particl stakers for any kind of development actively benefiting the Particl network. While still a few months away from being a real possibility, any outside/third-party development team will be able to submit formal proposals to the Particl network and request stakers to passively donate a portion of their staking rewards to a development fund.</p><p>This funding model is quite different than the now popular ICO model, as it doesn’t automatically secure an upfront amount of money to a development team, instead providing a steady but more reasonable stream of funds. This ensures the development teams stay motivated and incentivized to develop the product that they promised the community, which is even truer when the funding itself can be cut at any moment by the stakers (they only need to stop redirecting their staking rewards to this project’s development fund).</p><p>This form of funding model also encourages developers to build products that are beneficial to the entire Particl ecosystem itself. That is because decentralized applications on Particl will work using the PART coin, at least initially, and do not allow developers to create tokens for themselves and disregard the Particl ecosystem as a whole. This is true for stakers as well, redirecting their staking rewards to a project’s development fund does not award them with any kind of token, therefore they will want to donate to projects that are going to be directly beneficial to the Particl platform, coin, and ecosystem.</p><h2 id=\"stay-tuned-\">Stay Tuned!</h2><p>There is so much development being made on Particl right now, stay tuned for more detailed updates about each of the aforementioned items as they near mainnet or testnet implementation.

Don’t worry, this update\nshould keep you up to speed with all the latest developments and news\nsurrounding the project!\n\nCommunity Questions\nLast week’s livestream had to be delayed for a week, so the community had quite\na few questions for Paul. Note that some of these answers have been updated with\nthe most recent news and developments that happened since the livestream.\n\nWhen can a new Particl Desktop be expected?\n\nCold staking widget is back!A new update (1.2.2) for Particl Desktop is almost\nready and should be released any day from now. Currently at the pre-release\nstage, it is going to be a big release with several bug fixes (i.e. cold staking\nwidget), stability improvements as well as a lot of new additions. Most\nimportantly, this new release sets the stage for a more intuitive and\nuser-friendly approach we want to adopt as we near towards the release of our\nmainnet Particl Marketplace.\n\nWe strongly believe that a solid underlying technology, that of which we are\nabsolutely confident in, is only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to\ncreating a product used by millions of people online. Usability and aesthetics\nalso go a long way to attract a wider range of users, especially when building\nan online marketplace where looks and feel plays a very big part.\n\nFor a Particl Desktop 1.2.2 showcase, watch the video Christina, our social\nmedia coordinator, has put together two weeks ago on our Youtube channel.\n[https://youtu.be/NmrdI6w-hME]\n\nIs there any update about exchanges listing?\n\nWe are, as always, very commited to exchanges who contact us with interests to\nget the PART coin listed. Providing liquidity for the Particl economy is very\nimportant, especially as we get closer to the release of our mainnet Particl\nMarketplace. The more liquidity there is for vendors and buyers, the smoother\nand more seamless the experience will be.\n\nWe’ve been, however, changing our strategy as to how we approach exchanges. Due\nto our legal compliance commitment, we’ve stopped contacting smaller exchanges,\nrather focusing our efforts towards larger exchanges who have been proactive\nwith securing proper legal compliance. As such, we are now only reaching out to\nexchanges who do the proper legal work when it comes to paperwork, due diligence\nand working with regulatory bodies. That does not, however, stop any exchange\nfrom adding PART to their platform or approaching the team about doing so.\n\nWhat would be the impact of the PART coin dropping further in price?\n\nDarpal Rating’s June Github Audit ReportWhile a more valuable PART coin allows\nus to do more, the survival of the project does not depend on the price of the\nPART coin. In fact, salaries are secured for at least until April of next year,\nand may even stretch for longer if the PART coin was to rise in value.\n\nThe Particl Foundation website [https://particl.foundation] is the best resource\nfor most questions surrounding financials.\n\nNo matter what the price of the PART coin is, it will never affect how much work\nwe put into developing the Particl project.\n\nIndeed, during the month of June, while the PART coin was at its historic lowest\nvalue, Darpal Rating [https://medium.com/@DPRating], a rating agency conducting\na monthly leaderboard of the best Github pages in the blockchain industry, \nranked Particl 6th in total, first in both decentralized marketplaces and\nprivacy coins\n[https://medium.com/dprating/dprating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-june-2018-who-is-still-coding-in-the-bear-283c89735cbe]\n. Not only is this a great achievement, but Github isn’t even where most of the\ndevelopment process happens, the bulk of it being done on Jira.\n\nThese consistent good results when audited by Darpal Rating\n[https://twitter.com/LiteBitCo/status/1022583818132357120] only confirms the\nrelentlessness of the development force behind Particl.\n\nWe are also planning on running a primary round in and around Q1 2019. This\nfunding round will allow us to raise even more capital and allow us to take\nParticl to the next level by being much more aggressive with how we spend and\ninvest funds. We need, however, to implement the first version (post-beta) of\nParticl Marketplace before attempting to raise any capital. This is how startups\nusually do it; securing just enough funds to produce an MVP at first, then\nraising more funds once they present the MVP to VC investors.\n\nThe primary round will be an important milestone for the Particl project as it\nwill signal a shift from a purely developmental phase to a more balanced one\nwhere marketing, user acquisition, partnerships and other similar ventures will\nbe more prevalent than they currently are.\n\nAny update on Particl’s Ledger Wallet integration?\n\nThere is no update to give since our last livestream. Our end of the Ledger\nintegration process is completed and we have submitted a pull request to Ledger\nso that the PART coin can be officially integrated into their interface. We\nencourage the entire Particl community to reach out to Ledger and ask them to\nintegrate PART into Ledger as that can sometimes speed up the process by showing\norganic community support.\n\nNote that, while it is currently possible to use PART on Ledger Wallet, it is\nrecommended for advanced users only. The integration currently only works with\npublic transactions; CT and RingCT integrations will come at a later time.\n\nThere is, however, a good news! We have started working on another hardware\nintegration: Trezor.\n\nIs the team currently looking into integrating Kovri (i2p)?\n\nWe are currently not looking into Kovri, especially as it is not\nproduction-ready at the moment and isn’t expected to be for quite some time.\nWhat we’re looking into, however, is the new Bitcoin-Core BIP from llaanwj\n[https://gist.github.com/laanwj/4fe8470881d7b9499eedc48dc9ef1ad1] that would\nallow for bigger networking addresses (addrv2). This would make I2P routing\nfeasible, but would still require a controller (similar to TorControl) to\ngenerate addresses on the fly. We are also interested in alternative garlic\nrouting protocols and our codebase is developed with this precisely in mind.\n\nIs it looking at Bulletproofs?\nAs for Bulletproofs, they already are one of our roadmap’s item and are\nsomething we absolutely want to tackle. We’ve started looking into it, but the\nproper research & development on how to implement it on the Particl blockchain\nhasn’t started yet as it wasn’t our focus for the previous months. We plan,\nhowever, to do a team meeting soon focused in part on the integration of\nBulletproofs onto Particl. As that protocol will allow Particl privacy\ntransactions to shrink by about 80% in size, it is high in our list of\npriorities when it comes to making Particl a scalable platform, so expect that\nprotocol to be merged onto our blockchain at some point in the future.\n\nFor more information about Bulletproofs, don’t hesitate to read its whitepaper\nhere: https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf\n\nAny plan on porting the Particl Copay mobile wallet on iOS?\n\nYes, this is something we would like to do in the future. As with everything\nelse, it’s mostly a question of priorities. Right now, the focus is on the\nmarketplace (governance and new features) and RingCT (mainnet implementation and\nhardfork). It is, however, possible to use Particl Copay on MacOS (desktop\nversion).\n\nWe also have a new top-tier developer joining our ranks starting August 1st. The\nentire team is very excited about him and we will present him in time to the\ncommunity. This developer will lead the Particl Desktop team, but it is also\npossible that his work overlaps into Particl Copay so that more features can be\nadded to it.\n\nWill there be another mobile wallet with the full suite of features included in\nParticl Desktop such as the marketplace?\n\nYes. We are well aware that, nowadays, a lot of the shopping on the internet is\ndone with smartphones. We also know that some of our target users, especially\nthose in the “unbanked world”, do not own computers but rather smartphones\ninstead. For these reasons, we strongly believe we absolutely need a mobile\nversion for the marketplace and will put the resources in place for this further\ndown the road. It’s noteworthy to mention that our current work being done on\nthe multi-wallet feature is an important milestone in making both a secure \ndecentralized web interface and mobile application possible.\n\nAs we are heavily focused on security and privacy, it will be important to set\nup a dedicated team with experienced mobile engineers. For this reason, this\nmobile application project will definitely have to be done after the primary\nround where we will have more funds to dedicate to this initiative. But rest\nassured, we know we need this and will make it happen!\n\nSuch a project is a good example of what we meant earlier in this article when\nwe said that raising more funds will allow us to take Particl to the next level.\n\nWhen will the chat function be integrated into Particl Desktop?\n\nParticl’s messaging system, SMSG, is already live on mainnet since the genesis\nblock but indeed hasn’t been integrated into Particl Desktop yet. Paul says the\nmessaging system is really something needed for vendors and buyers to be able to\ncommunicate together so that the market transactions happen more smoothly. The\nteam is currently working on several items at once, and while SMSG is currently\nnot in the current developers’ workload, it might be added to it soon.\n\nWill there be a marketing push for RingCT?\n\nYes, expect us to start communicating more about the coming RingCT Bitcoin-based\nhardfork. We need to claim it our own and want to lead up to its release\nsimilarly to how we did it with cold staking. Porting the RingCT privacy\nprotocol from the Cryptonote codebase to the Bitcoin codebase (or any other\ncodebase other than Cryptonote) is a great achievement, and it needs to be\nproperly advertised as such.\n\nWhat’s the ETA for the mainnet implementation of RingCT?\n\nIntegrating RingCT onto our mainnet will require a planned hardfork, and we’re\ncurrently working on all the preparations required to make it happen. As a\nhardfork causes stress on the network and requires quite a lot of preparation\nfor it to happen as smoothly as possible, and as the marketplace governance\nsystem also requires a hardfork, it will be simpler and more time/resource\nefficient to combine the two items into one single planned hardfork. This is the\nlikely strategy the team will pursue.\n\nWith that being said, it could mean that, even though our RingCT implementation\nmay be ready for implementation, it could be waiting in the wings so that it can\nbe included at the same time as the governance system.\n\nDo you have an update on the WSA Particl code audit?\n\nWeSecureApp (WSA) is a cybersecurity firm specializing in security consulting,\nauditing and testing services. We’ve hired them to perform a full Particl code\naudit and have received their initial, summarized report. They’ve tested Particl\nfor the whole suite of industry standard test cases as well as building 10\ncustom test cases specifically built for Particl. We are proud to announce that\nno major vulnerability or flaw was found in the Particl protocol and that only\nsome minor issues have been identified and are being addressed! We have yet to\nreceive the fully detailed report.\n\nGraphic shows small portion of tests performed — The audit identified no flaw in\nthe Particl protocolAre Particl Marketplace Alpha transactions currently public?\n\nYes, transactions are currently public. We are still working on and developing\nour private-by-design MAD escrow smart-contract, and it is a work-in-progress\nwhich will be implemented in several steps. Particl Marketplace’s escrow system\nis going to be designed as a private-by-default solution, meaning that\nultimately it will not process transactions publicly when we release our first\npost-beta version. Note that Particl Marketplace currently operates on testnet\nexclusively and that its transactions are fictional and for testing purposes\nonly.\n\nWhen will the Particl Foundation make public its Q2 financial report?\n\nThe report should be posted soon on the Particl Foundation website. Keep an eye\nout here: http://particl.foundation/financial-reports\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdates & Tidbits\nPaul also had a few comments and information for the community not covered by\nthe questions asked by the community.\n\nGithub\nOne of the best ways to keep updated with the development side of the Particl\nproject is to go to the source. In fact, our Github page contains a lot of\ninformation and is quite active with daily updates. One of the most interesting\nway to see what’s coming is to have a look at the pull requests made for each of\nour repositories.\n\nFor example, the Particl Desktop pull request tab\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pulls] shows a few interesting pull\nrequests being made for Particl Desktop. Among these requests, we can find\ninformation about multi-wallets\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1096], project governance\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1087] (community proposals), \nand more\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed].\n\nNew Status Report Published\nFor those looking for a more simple and to-the-point way to keep up-to-date with\nthe Particl development news, the Status Report\n[http://particl.io/status-report/] on our website (particl.io) is the perfect\npoint of reference. It was last updated a week and gives a lot of details about\nwhat is going to be included in the Beta version of Particl Marketplace, as well\nas what the team is currently focusing on development-wise!\n\nStatus ReportProject Governance (Community Proposals)\nAs you can see in both the GIF above and in the Status Report\n[http://particl.io/status-report/], we’re currently actively working on putting\ntogether the “project governance” tools which will allow anyone to submit their\nown proposals up for a community poll. Community submitted proposals do not\nrepresent any form of finality; proposals may still be denied even though they\nwere voted in favor of, and vice versa. Official proposals, on the other hand,\nare proposals submitted by the Particl Foundation itself. These types of\nproposals will represent finality, meaning whatever result it gets will be\nadopted and acted upon.\n\nFor more screenshots of the project governance user interface, click here\n[https://imgur.com/a/JN8nQ8q], and for more information about the development of\nthis Particl Desktop feature, click here\n[https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1087].\n\nCommunity Fund\nIn light of the development being made on the project governance tools, there\nhas never been a better time to put your proposals up for discussion on our\nKialo thread! In fact, the Particl community currently owns a shared fund of\naround 33,000 PART. These PART can exclusively be used by the Particl Community,\nnot the Particl Foundation, meaning that votes on proposals will need to be held\non the blockchain before any of those funds can be moved or utilized. Get the\ncommunity to know your idea well before officially putting it up for a vote on\nParticl Desktop by creating a discussion topic on our Kialo thread\n[https://youtu.be/NmrdI6w-hME].\n\nFirst Anniversary\nWe celebrated Particl’s 17th of July 2018 first anniversary! In fact, Particl’s\ngenesis block was staked on the 17th of Jul 17, 2017, at 9:00:00 AM\n[https://explorer.particl.io/block/0000ee0784c195317ac95623e22fddb8c7b8825dc3998e0bb924d66866eccf4c]\n, and we took the opportunity to thank our supporters and recap on the progress\nmade in just a short year\n[https://particl.news/particl-genesis-anniversary-b2d4ceff1f95]. The best is yet\nto come!\n\nNJIT’s Academic Paper\nWe currently are reviewing NJIT’s academic paper based on their research and\nwork on Particl’s RingCT Bitcoin-based implementation. We will be giving them\nthe green light once we are satisfied with it so that they can publish it within\nacademic circles. We will let them publish the paper on their end sometime\nbefore we make it public on ours.\n\nParticl in Johannesburg\nMembers of the Particl team will have a booth at this year’s blockchain event in\nJohannesburg, South Africa. The conference is a one-day event with a focus on\nBlockchain Technology and is in part sponsored by the Particl Foundation. Stop\nby the Particl booth to talk with team members and get Particl swag!\n\nFor more information about the schedule and to get tickets, follow this link: \nhttps://particl.news/particl-on-location-at-johannesburg-blockchain-conference-july-27th-2018-7e19fa083b08\n\nDiscord\nWe will gradually be moving to Discord officially, which means it will become\nthe preferred or “default” chat platform for most of the team and chat support.\nWe will keep the Rutherford bot up so that users on platforms other than Discord\ncan still interact with the rest of the community, but these other platforms\nwill not be focused on as much as before.\n\nWe believe Discord to be a good platform on which to build our community on. Its\nflexibility will allow us to integrate it seamlessly with the coming Discourse\nforum and will give us the ability to improve the overall community experience\nwith bots and better moderation/anti-spam capabilities.\n\nMusic Channel\nOne cool example of what bots can bring to our chat is the recently added #music\nchannel. Anyone with “DJ” permissions on Discord can now play and manage music\nthat anyone in the #music voice channel can listen to. Tag Cryptoguard on\nDiscord if you wish to be added as a DJ so that you can share your favorite\nmusic with other Particl community members!\n\nParticl on Discourse\nWe are currently getting a forum ready and are in the final stages of setting it\nup. We have encountered some minor issues which have delayed its launch but it\nshould probably be resolved for next week.\n\nDemonstration of the coming Particl forumLaunching the forum will change a few\nthings around. For one, we will shut down the Fancorps platform and move the\nPartaker Hub over to the forum. This move is due to the fact that we have found\na few bugs and exploits with the platform which allows people to duplicate\nwithdrawals. We’ve also been suffering a few stability issues with the platform\nwhich we entirely believe will be fixed with the forum. We’re currently looking\ninto potentially building our own custom Partaker Hub plugin for Discourse. We\nwill keep you updated about this and will make proper announcements regarding\neverything forum related.\n\nOne other major use case of our forum will be for user support. Whether it be\nfor vendor, buyer or user support, we need to have a central point of reference\nto get the support users are going to require, especially as we release a\nproduct (Particl Marketplace) that will target a vast array of user types. We\nstrongly believe the forum will help to create a more structured discussion flow\nand the fact that the information stays permanently archived online for anyone\nto dig is going to help a lot on-boarding new users into the platform.\n\nNew Merch Available for Free on Particl Marketplace\nWe will soon make available new Particl merch and goodies for free on Particl\nMarketplace.

Note that some of these answers have been updated with the most recent news and developments that happened since the livestream.</p><p><strong>When can a new Particl Desktop be expected?</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-HvxF1evJHXiJqO-NkfSxwQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Cold staking widget is back!</figcaption></figure><p>A new update (1.2.2) for Particl Desktop is almost ready and should be released any day from now. Currently at the pre-release stage, it is going to be a big release with several bug fixes (i.e. cold staking widget), stability improvements as well as a lot of new additions. Most importantly, this new release sets the stage for a more intuitive and user-friendly approach we want to adopt as we near towards the release of our mainnet Particl Marketplace.</p><p>We strongly believe that a solid underlying technology, that of which we are absolutely confident in, is only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to creating a product used by millions of people online. Usability and aesthetics also go a long way to attract a wider range of users, especially when building an online marketplace where looks and feel plays a very big part.</p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/NmrdI6w-hME\">For a Particl Desktop 1.2.2 showcase, watch the video Christina, our social media coordinator, has put together two weeks ago on our Youtube channel.</a></p><p><strong>Is there any update about exchanges listing?</strong></p><p>We are, as always, very commited to exchanges who contact us with interests to get the PART coin listed. Providing liquidity for the Particl economy is very important, especially as we get closer to the release of our mainnet Particl Marketplace. The more liquidity there is for vendors and buyers, the smoother and more seamless the experience will be.</p><p>We’ve been, however, changing our strategy as to how we approach exchanges. Due to our legal compliance commitment, we’ve stopped contacting smaller exchanges, rather focusing our efforts towards larger exchanges who have been proactive with securing proper legal compliance. As such, we are now only reaching out to exchanges who do the proper legal work when it comes to paperwork, due diligence and working with regulatory bodies. That does not, however, stop any exchange from adding PART to their platform or approaching the team about doing so.</p><p><strong>What would be the impact of the PART coin dropping further in price?</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-DMZNvDVsJwSGgpj57S2nqg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Darpal Rating’s June Github Audit Report</figcaption></figure><p>While a more valuable PART coin allows us to do more, <strong>the survival of the project does not depend on the price of the PART coin.</strong> In fact, salaries are secured for at least until April of next year, and may even stretch for longer if the PART coin was to rise in value.</p><p>The Particl Foundation <a href=\"https://particl.foundation\">website</a> is the best resource for most questions surrounding financials.</p><p><strong>No matter what the price of the PART coin is, it will never affect how much work we put into developing the Particl project.</strong></p><p>Indeed, during the month of June, while the PART coin was at its historic lowest value, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@DPRating\">Darpal Rating</a>, a rating agency conducting a monthly leaderboard of the best Github pages in the blockchain industry, <a href=\"https://medium.com/dprating/dprating-github-audit-for-200-blockchain-projects-june-2018-who-is-still-coding-in-the-bear-283c89735cbe\">ranked Particl 6th in total, first in both decentralized marketplaces and privacy coins</a>. Not only is this a great achievement, but Github isn’t even where most of the development process happens, the bulk of it being done on Jira.</p><p>These <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LiteBitCo/status/1022583818132357120\">consistent good results when audited by Darpal Rating</a> only confirms the relentlessness of the development force behind Particl.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-NcRxl0LrPXpYZ2ybQx2Wmw.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>We are also planning on running a primary round in and around Q1 2019. This funding round will allow us to raise even more capital and allow us to take Particl to the next level by being much more aggressive with how we spend and invest funds. We need, however, to implement the first version (post-beta) of Particl Marketplace before attempting to raise any capital. This is how startups usually do it; securing just enough funds to produce an MVP at first, then raising more funds once they present the MVP to VC investors.</p><p>The primary round will be an important milestone for the Particl project as it will signal a shift from a purely developmental phase to a more balanced one where marketing, user acquisition, partnerships and other similar ventures will be more prevalent than they currently are.</p><p><strong>Any update on Particl’s Ledger Wallet integration?</strong></p><p>There is no update to give since our last livestream. Our end of the Ledger integration process is completed and we have submitted a pull request to Ledger so that the PART coin can be officially integrated into their interface. We encourage the entire Particl community to reach out to Ledger and ask them to integrate PART into Ledger as that can sometimes speed up the process by showing organic community support.</p><p>Note that, while it is currently possible to use PART on Ledger Wallet, it is recommended for advanced users only. The integration currently only works with public transactions; CT and RingCT integrations will come at a later time.</p><p>There is, however, a good news! We have started working on another hardware integration: Trezor.</p><p><strong>Is the team currently looking into integrating Kovri (i2p)?</strong></p><p>We are currently not looking into Kovri, especially as it is not production-ready at the moment and isn’t expected to be for quite some time. What we’re looking into, however, is the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/laanwj/4fe8470881d7b9499eedc48dc9ef1ad1\">new Bitcoin-Core BIP from llaanwj</a> that would allow for bigger networking addresses (addrv2). This would make I2P routing feasible, but would still require a controller (similar to TorControl) to generate addresses on the fly. We are also interested in alternative garlic routing protocols and our codebase is developed with this precisely in mind.</p><h3 id=\"is-it-looking-at-bulletproofs\">Is it looking at Bulletproofs?</h3><p>As for Bulletproofs, they already are one of our roadmap’s item and are something we absolutely want to tackle. We’ve started looking into it, but the proper research &amp; development on how to implement it on the Particl blockchain hasn’t started yet as it wasn’t our focus for the previous months. We plan, however, to do a team meeting soon focused in part on the integration of Bulletproofs onto Particl. As that protocol will allow Particl privacy transactions to shrink by about 80% in size, it is high in our list of priorities when it comes to making Particl a scalable platform, so expect that protocol to be merged onto our blockchain at some point in the future.</p><p>For more information about Bulletproofs, don’t hesitate to read its whitepaper here: <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf\">https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf</a></p><p><strong>Any plan on porting the Particl Copay mobile wallet on iOS?</strong></p><p>Yes, this is something we would like to do in the future. As with everything else, it’s mostly a question of priorities. Right now, the focus is on the marketplace (governance and new features) and RingCT (mainnet implementation and hardfork). It is, however, possible to use Particl Copay on MacOS (desktop version).</p><p>We also have a new top-tier developer joining our ranks starting August 1st. The entire team is very excited about him and we will present him in time to the community. This developer will lead the Particl Desktop team, but it is also possible that his work overlaps into Particl Copay so that more features can be added to it.</p><p><strong>Will there be another mobile wallet with the full suite of features included in Particl Desktop such as the marketplace?</strong></p><p>Yes. We are well aware that, nowadays, a lot of the shopping on the internet is done with smartphones. We also know that some of our target users, especially those in the “unbanked world”, do not own computers but rather smartphones instead. For these reasons, we strongly believe <strong>we absolutely need a mobile version for the marketplace</strong> and will put the resources in place for this further down the road. It’s noteworthy to mention that our current work being done on the multi-wallet feature is an important milestone in making both a <strong>secure </strong>decentralized web interface and mobile application possible.</p><p>As we are heavily focused on security and privacy, it will be important to set up a dedicated team with experienced mobile engineers. For this reason, this mobile application project will definitely have to be done after the primary round where we will have more funds to dedicate to this initiative. But rest assured, we know we need this and will make it happen!</p><p>Such a project is a good example of what we meant earlier in this article when we said that raising more funds will allow us to take Particl to the next level.</p><p><strong>When will the chat function be integrated into Particl Desktop?</strong></p><p>Particl’s messaging system, SMSG, is already live on mainnet since the genesis block but indeed hasn’t been integrated into Particl Desktop yet. Paul says the messaging system is really something needed for vendors and buyers to be able to communicate together so that the market transactions happen more smoothly. The team is currently working on several items at once, and while SMSG is currently not in the current developers’ workload, it might be added to it soon.</p><p><strong>Will there be a marketing push for RingCT?</strong></p><p>Yes, expect us to start communicating more about the coming RingCT Bitcoin-based hardfork. We need to claim it our own and want to lead up to its release similarly to how we did it with cold staking. Porting the RingCT privacy protocol from the Cryptonote codebase to the Bitcoin codebase (or any other codebase other than Cryptonote) is a great achievement, and it needs to be properly advertised as such.</p><p><strong>What’s the ETA for the mainnet implementation of RingCT?</strong></p><p>Integrating RingCT onto our mainnet will require a planned hardfork, and we’re currently working on all the preparations required to make it happen. As a hardfork causes stress on the network and requires quite a lot of preparation for it to happen as smoothly as possible, and as the marketplace governance system also requires a hardfork, it will be simpler and more time/resource efficient to combine the two items into one single planned hardfork. This is the likely strategy the team will pursue.</p><p>With that being said, it could mean that, even though our RingCT implementation may be ready for implementation, it could be waiting in the wings so that it can be included at the same time as the governance system.</p><p><strong>Do you have an update on the WSA Particl code audit?</strong></p><p>WeSecureApp (WSA) is a cybersecurity firm specializing in security consulting, auditing and testing services. We’ve hired them to perform a full Particl code audit and have received their initial, summarized report. They’ve tested Particl for the whole suite of industry standard test cases as well as building 10 custom test cases specifically built for Particl. We are proud to announce that no major vulnerability or flaw was found in the Particl protocol and that only some minor issues have been identified and are being addressed! We have yet to receive the fully detailed report.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-NIKYtvnIcCCfLi2otcVl2w.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Graphic shows small portion of tests performed — The audit identified no flaw in the Particl protocol</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Are Particl Marketplace Alpha transactions currently public?</strong></p><p>Yes, transactions are currently public. We are still working on and developing our private-by-design MAD escrow smart-contract, and it is a work-in-progress which will be implemented in several steps. Particl Marketplace’s escrow system is going to be designed as a private-by-default solution, meaning that ultimately it will not process transactions publicly when we release our first post-beta version. Note that Particl Marketplace currently operates on testnet exclusively and that its transactions are fictional and for testing purposes only.</p><p><strong>When will the Particl Foundation make public its Q2 financial report?</strong></p><p>The report should be posted soon on the Particl Foundation website. Keep an eye out here: <a href=\"http://particl.foundation/financial-reports\">http://particl.foundation/financial-reports</a></p><hr><h2 id=\"updates-tidbits\">Updates &amp; Tidbits</h2><p>Paul also had a few comments and information for the community not covered by the questions asked by the community.</p><h3 id=\"github\">Github</h3><p>One of the best ways to keep updated with the development side of the Particl project is to go to the source. In fact, our Github page contains a lot of information and is quite active with daily updates. One of the most interesting way to see what’s coming is to have a look at the pull requests made for each of our repositories.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-NMRZXp9c4-okdV3gNRN3dw.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>For example, the <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pulls\">Particl Desktop pull request tab</a> shows a few interesting pull requests being made for Particl Desktop. Among these requests, we can find information about <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1096\">multi-wallets</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1087\">project governance</a> (community proposals), <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed\">and more</a>.</p><h3 id=\"new-status-report-published\">New Status Report Published</h3><p>For those looking for a more simple and to-the-point way to keep up-to-date with the Particl development news, the <a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\">Status Report</a> on our website (particl.io) is the perfect point of reference. It was last updated a week and gives a lot of details about what is going to be included in the Beta version of Particl Marketplace, as well as what the team is currently focusing on development-wise!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-NFoIFPJqgKElhAPMWReMiA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Status Report</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"project-governance-community-proposals-\">Project Governance (Community Proposals)</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-3UqZHLKP-rRwh8VI8lvCeg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>As you can see in both the GIF above and in the <a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\">Status Report</a>, we’re currently actively working on putting together the “project governance” tools which will allow anyone to submit their own proposals up for a community poll. Community submitted proposals do not represent any form of finality; proposals may still be denied even though they were voted in favor of, and vice versa. Official proposals, on the other hand, are proposals submitted by the Particl Foundation itself. These types of proposals will represent finality, meaning whatever result it gets will be adopted and acted upon.</p><p>For more screenshots of the project governance user interface, <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/JN8nQ8q\">click here</a>, and for more information about the development of this Particl Desktop feature, <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1087\">click here</a>.</p><h3 id=\"community-fund\">Community Fund</h3><p>In light of the development being made on the project governance tools, there has never been a better time to put your proposals up for discussion on our Kialo thread! In fact, the Particl community currently owns a shared fund of around 33,000 PART. These PART can exclusively be used by the Particl Community, not the Particl Foundation, meaning that votes on proposals will need to be held on the blockchain before any of those funds can be moved or utilized. Get the community to know your idea well before officially putting it up for a vote on Particl Desktop by <a href=\"https://youtu.be/NmrdI6w-hME\">creating a discussion topic on our Kialo thread</a>.</p><h3 id=\"first-anniversary\">First Anniversary</h3><p>We celebrated Particl’s 17th of July 2018 first anniversary! In fact, Particl’s genesis block was <a href=\"https://explorer.particl.io/block/0000ee0784c195317ac95623e22fddb8c7b8825dc3998e0bb924d66866eccf4c\">staked on the 17th of Jul 17, 2017, at 9:00:00 AM</a>, and we took the opportunity to <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-genesis-anniversary-b2d4ceff1f95\">thank our supporters and recap on the progress made in just a short year</a>. The best is yet to come!</p><h3 id=\"njit-s-academic-paper\">NJIT’s Academic Paper</h3><p>We currently are reviewing NJIT’s academic paper based on their research and work on Particl’s RingCT Bitcoin-based implementation. We will be giving them the green light once we are satisfied with it so that they can publish it within academic circles. We will let them publish the paper on their end sometime before we make it public on ours.</p><h3 id=\"particl-in-johannesburg\">Particl in Johannesburg</h3><p>Members of the Particl team will have a booth at this year’s blockchain event in Johannesburg, South Africa. The conference is a one-day event with a focus on Blockchain Technology and is in part sponsored by the Particl Foundation. Stop by the Particl booth to talk with team members and get Particl swag!</p><p>For more information about the schedule and to get tickets, follow this link: <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-on-location-at-johannesburg-blockchain-conference-july-27th-2018-7e19fa083b08\">https://particl.news/particl-on-location-at-johannesburg-blockchain-conference-july-27th-2018-7e19fa083b08</a></p><h3 id=\"discord\"><strong>Discord</strong></h3><p>We will gradually be moving to Discord officially, which means it will become the preferred or “default” chat platform for most of the team and chat support. We will keep the Rutherford bot up so that users on platforms other than Discord can still interact with the rest of the community, but these other platforms will not be focused on as much as before.</p><p>We believe Discord to be a good platform on which to build our community on. Its flexibility will allow us to integrate it seamlessly with the coming Discourse forum and will give us the ability to improve the overall community experience with bots and better moderation/anti-spam capabilities.</p><h3 id=\"music-channel\">Music Channel</h3><p>One cool example of what bots can bring to our chat is the recently added #music channel. Anyone with “DJ” permissions on Discord can now play and manage music that anyone in the #music voice channel can listen to. Tag Cryptoguard on Discord if you wish to be added as a DJ so that you can share your favorite music with other Particl community members!</p><h3 id=\"particl-on-discourse\">Particl on Discourse</h3><p>We are currently getting a forum ready and are in the final stages of setting it up. We have encountered some minor issues which have delayed its launch but it should probably be resolved for next week.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://localhost:2368/content/images/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-cBKLFANfZQHq8Ij8yMgDTg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt><figcaption>Demonstration of the coming Particl forum</figcaption></figure><p>Launching the forum will change a few things around. For one, we will shut down the Fancorps platform and move the Partaker Hub over to the forum. This move is due to the fact that we have found a few bugs and exploits with the platform which allows people to duplicate withdrawals. We’ve also been suffering a few stability issues with the platform which we entirely believe will be fixed with the forum. We’re currently looking into potentially building our own custom Partaker Hub plugin for Discourse. We will keep you updated about this and will make proper announcements regarding everything forum related.</p><p>One other major use case of our forum will be for user support. Whether it be for vendor, buyer or user support, we need to have a central point of reference to get the support users are going to require, especially as we release a product (Particl Marketplace) that will target a vast array of user types. We strongly believe the forum will help to create a more structured discussion flow and the fact that the information stays permanently archived online for anyone to dig is going to help a lot on-boarding new users into the platform.</p><h3 id=\"new-merch-available-for-free-on-particl-marketplace\">New Merch Available for Free on Particl Marketplace</h3><p>We will soon make available new Particl merch and goodies for free on Particl Marketplace. One of these goodies we want to make available are the pins generously offered to us by ICOsensei.

We are also interested in alternative garlic routing protocols and our codebase is developed with this precisely in mind.</p><h3 id=\"is-it-looking-at-bulletproofs\">Is it looking at Bulletproofs?</h3><p>As for Bulletproofs, they already are one of our roadmap’s item and are something we absolutely want to tackle. We’ve started looking into it, but the proper research &#x26; development on how to implement it on the Particl blockchain hasn’t started yet as it wasn’t our focus for the previous months. We plan, however, to do a team meeting soon focused in part on the integration of Bulletproofs onto Particl. As that protocol will allow Particl privacy transactions to shrink by about 80% in size, it is high in our list of priorities when it comes to making Particl a scalable platform, so expect that protocol to be merged onto our blockchain at some point in the future.</p><p>For more information about Bulletproofs, don’t hesitate to read its whitepaper here: <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf\">https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf</a></p><p><strong>Any plan on porting the Particl Copay mobile wallet on iOS?</strong></p><p>Yes, this is something we would like to do in the future. As with everything else, it’s mostly a question of priorities. Right now, the focus is on the marketplace (governance and new features) and RingCT (mainnet implementation and hardfork). It is, however, possible to use Particl Copay on MacOS (desktop version).</p><p>We also have a new top-tier developer joining our ranks starting August 1st. The entire team is very excited about him and we will present him in time to the community. This developer will lead the Particl Desktop team, but it is also possible that his work overlaps into Particl Copay so that more features can be added to it.</p><p><strong>Will there be another mobile wallet with the full suite of features included in Particl Desktop such as the marketplace?</strong></p><p>Yes. We are well aware that, nowadays, a lot of the shopping on the internet is done with smartphones. We also know that some of our target users, especially those in the “unbanked world”, do not own computers but rather smartphones instead. For these reasons, we strongly believe <strong>we absolutely need a mobile version for the marketplace</strong> and will put the resources in place for this further down the road. It’s noteworthy to mention that our current work being done on the multi-wallet feature is an important milestone in making both a <strong>secure </strong>decentralized web interface and mobile application possible.</p><p>As we are heavily focused on security and privacy, it will be important to set up a dedicated team with experienced mobile engineers. For this reason, this mobile application project will definitely have to be done after the primary round where we will have more funds to dedicate to this initiative. But rest assured, we know we need this and will make it happen!</p><p>Such a project is a good example of what we meant earlier in this article when we said that raising more funds will allow us to take Particl to the next level.</p><p><strong>When will the chat function be integrated into Particl Desktop?</strong></p><p>Particl’s messaging system, SMSG, is already live on mainnet since the genesis block but indeed hasn’t been integrated into Particl Desktop yet. Paul says the messaging system is really something needed for vendors and buyers to be able to communicate together so that the market transactions happen more smoothly. The team is currently working on several items at once, and while SMSG is currently not in the current developers’ workload, it might be added to it soon.</p><p><strong>Will there be a marketing push for RingCT?</strong></p><p>Yes, expect us to start communicating more about the coming RingCT Bitcoin-based hardfork. We need to claim it our own and want to lead up to its release similarly to how we did it with cold staking. Porting the RingCT privacy protocol from the Cryptonote codebase to the Bitcoin codebase (or any other codebase other than Cryptonote) is a great achievement, and it needs to be properly advertised as such.</p><p><strong>What’s the ETA for the mainnet implementation of RingCT?</strong></p><p>Integrating RingCT onto our mainnet will require a planned hardfork, and we’re currently working on all the preparations required to make it happen. As a hardfork causes stress on the network and requires quite a lot of preparation for it to happen as smoothly as possible, and as the marketplace governance system also requires a hardfork, it will be simpler and more time/resource efficient to combine the two items into one single planned hardfork. This is the likely strategy the team will pursue.</p><p>With that being said, it could mean that, even though our RingCT implementation may be ready for implementation, it could be waiting in the wings so that it can be included at the same time as the governance system.</p><p><strong>Do you have an update on the WSA Particl code audit?</strong></p><p>WeSecureApp (WSA) is a cybersecurity firm specializing in security consulting, auditing and testing services. We’ve hired them to perform a full Particl code audit and have received their initial, summarized report. They’ve tested Particl for the whole suite of industry standard test cases as well as building 10 custom test cases specifically built for Particl. We are proud to announce that no major vulnerability or flaw was found in the Particl protocol and that only some minor issues have been identified and are being addressed! We have yet to receive the fully detailed report.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-NIKYtvnIcCCfLi2otcVl2w.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Graphic shows small portion of tests performed — The audit identified no flaw in the Particl protocol</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Are Particl Marketplace Alpha transactions currently public?</strong></p><p>Yes, transactions are currently public. We are still working on and developing our private-by-design MAD escrow smart-contract, and it is a work-in-progress which will be implemented in several steps. Particl Marketplace’s escrow system is going to be designed as a private-by-default solution, meaning that ultimately it will not process transactions publicly when we release our first post-beta version. Note that Particl Marketplace currently operates on testnet exclusively and that its transactions are fictional and for testing purposes only.</p><p><strong>When will the Particl Foundation make public its Q2 financial report?</strong></p><p>The report should be posted soon on the Particl Foundation website.

In fact, our Github page contains a lot of information and is quite active with daily updates. One of the most interesting way to see what’s coming is to have a look at the pull requests made for each of our repositories.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-NMRZXp9c4-okdV3gNRN3dw.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>For example, the <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pulls\">Particl Desktop pull request tab</a> shows a few interesting pull requests being made for Particl Desktop. Among these requests, we can find information about <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1096\">multi-wallets</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1087\">project governance</a> (community proposals), <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed\">and more</a>.</p><h3 id=\"new-status-report-published\">New Status Report Published</h3><p>For those looking for a more simple and to-the-point way to keep up-to-date with the Particl development news, the <a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\">Status Report</a> on our website (particl.io) is the perfect point of reference. It was last updated a week and gives a lot of details about what is going to be included in the Beta version of Particl Marketplace, as well as what the team is currently focusing on development-wise!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-NFoIFPJqgKElhAPMWReMiA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Status Report</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"project-governance-community-proposals-\">Project Governance (Community Proposals)</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-3UqZHLKP-rRwh8VI8lvCeg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>As you can see in both the GIF above and in the <a href=\"http://particl.io/status-report/\">Status Report</a>, we’re currently actively working on putting together the “project governance” tools which will allow anyone to submit their own proposals up for a community poll. Community submitted proposals do not represent any form of finality; proposals may still be denied even though they were voted in favor of, and vice versa. Official proposals, on the other hand, are proposals submitted by the Particl Foundation itself. These types of proposals will represent finality, meaning whatever result it gets will be adopted and acted upon.</p><p>For more screenshots of the project governance user interface, <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/JN8nQ8q\">click here</a>, and for more information about the development of this Particl Desktop feature, <a href=\"https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop/pull/1087\">click here</a>.</p><h3 id=\"community-fund\">Community Fund</h3><p>In light of the development being made on the project governance tools, there has never been a better time to put your proposals up for discussion on our Kialo thread! In fact, the Particl community currently owns a shared fund of around 33,000 PART. These PART can exclusively be used by the Particl Community, not the Particl Foundation, meaning that votes on proposals will need to be held on the blockchain before any of those funds can be moved or utilized. Get the community to know your idea well before officially putting it up for a vote on Particl Desktop by <a href=\"https://youtu.be/NmrdI6w-hME\">creating a discussion topic on our Kialo thread</a>.</p><h3 id=\"first-anniversary\">First Anniversary</h3><p>We celebrated Particl’s 17th of July 2018 first anniversary! In fact, Particl’s genesis block was <a href=\"https://explorer.particl.io/block/0000ee0784c195317ac95623e22fddb8c7b8825dc3998e0bb924d66866eccf4c\">staked on the 17th of Jul 17, 2017, at 9:00:00 AM</a>, and we took the opportunity to <a href=\"https://particl.news/particl-genesis-anniversary-b2d4ceff1f95\">thank our supporters and recap on the progress made in just a short year</a>. The best is yet to come!</p><h3 id=\"njit-s-academic-paper\">NJIT’s Academic Paper</h3><p>We currently are reviewing NJIT’s academic paper based on their research and work on Particl’s RingCT Bitcoin-based implementation. We will be giving them the green light once we are satisfied with it so that they can publish it within academic circles. We will let them publish the paper on their end sometime before we make it public on ours.</p><h3 id=\"particl-in-johannesburg\">Particl in Johannesburg</h3><p>Members of the Particl team will have a booth at this year’s blockchain event in Johannesburg, South Africa.

We will keep the Rutherford bot up so that users on platforms other than Discord can still interact with the rest of the community, but these other platforms will not be focused on as much as before.</p><p>We believe Discord to be a good platform on which to build our community on. Its flexibility will allow us to integrate it seamlessly with the coming Discourse forum and will give us the ability to improve the overall community experience with bots and better moderation/anti-spam capabilities.</p><h3 id=\"music-channel\">Music Channel</h3><p>One cool example of what bots can bring to our chat is the recently added #music channel. Anyone with “DJ” permissions on Discord can now play and manage music that anyone in the #music voice channel can listen to. Tag Cryptoguard on Discord if you wish to be added as a DJ so that you can share your favorite music with other Particl community members!</p><h3 id=\"particl-on-discourse\">Particl on Discourse</h3><p>We are currently getting a forum ready and are in the final stages of setting it up. We have encountered some minor issues which have delayed its launch but it should probably be resolved for next week.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/glink/downloaded_images/Community-Update--3/1-cBKLFANfZQHq8Ij8yMgDTg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Demonstration of the coming Particl forum</figcaption></figure><p>Launching the forum will change a few things around. For one, we will shut down the Fancorps platform and move the Partaker Hub over to the forum. This move is due to the fact that we have found a few bugs and exploits with the platform which allows people to duplicate withdrawals. We’ve also been suffering a few stability issues with the platform which we entirely believe will be fixed with the forum. We’re currently looking into potentially building our own custom Partaker Hub plugin for Discourse. We will keep you updated about this and will make proper announcements regarding everything forum related.</p><p>One other major use case of our forum will be for user support. Whether it be for vendor, buyer or user support, we need to have a central point of reference to get the support users are going to require, especially as we release a product (Particl Marketplace) that will target a vast array of user types. We strongly believe the forum will help to create a more structured discussion flow and the fact that the information stays permanently archived online for anyone to dig is going to help a lot on-boarding new users into the platform.</p><h3 id=\"new-merch-available-for-free-on-particl-marketplace\">New Merch Available for Free on Particl Marketplace</h3><p>We will soon make available new Particl merch and goodies for free on Particl Marketplace.

It makes\nParticl faster, lighter, and as easy to use as ever. But more than just that, it\nalso adds a ton of new features and functionalities.\n\nIf you don’t know about Particl V3 yet, than make sure to click on the link\nbelow to get all currently available details.\n\nStepping Things Up Again With Particl Desktop 3.0\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\nA New Breakthrough for Privacy and eCommerce ?particl.news\n[https://particl.news/stepping-things-up-again-with-particl-desktop-3-0-383646386813]\n\nAlthough the focus has almost exclusively been on the Particl V3 release for the\nlast few months, Particl Core has been ready for it for quite some time. This\nhas given Tecnovert, Core Developer, enough time to work on a little surprise\nwhich has been a very popular request from the community for a long time.\n\nThis surprise can now be revealed! ?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMonero and Particl Atomic Swaps Live on Mainnet\nOn the 15th of September 2020, the first ever Monero to Particl atomic swap was\nsuccessfully completed on mainnet.\n\n * Particl's xmrswap repository: https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/\n * Transaction: \n   https://explorer.particl.io/tx/46a9ad3d1374e8e97c65fda7961ac8fa620c1c511400b1a0842bf5e851cbae30\n\nMonero — Particl Atomic Swap | Particl Insight\n[https://explorer.particl.io/tx/46a9ad3d1374e8e97c65fda7961ac8fa620c1c511400b1a0842bf5e851cbae30]\nParticl Insight.

The xmrswap protocol\nis based on the work of Joël Gugger (h4sh3d [https://github.com/h4sh3d]) from\nthe Monero community. You can read Joël’s extensive whitepaper by following \nthis\nlink\n[https://github.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap/blob/master/whitepaper/xmr-btc.pdf]\n.\n\nTo make a Monero to Particl (or the other way around) atomic swap on mainnet,\nyou’ll first need to find another peer that also wants to do a swap, agree on\nswap parameters (how many Coin A for how many Coin B), and then simply follow\nthese step-by-step instructions here\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/demo.md].\n\n * Step-by-step guide on how to make a XMR — PART atomic swap\n   [https://github.com/tecnovert/xmrswap/blob/master/doc/demo.md]\n\n> Note: xmrswap is a fully-functioning Proof-of-Concept for a protocol that allows\nswapping Monero to Particl without any third-party at all. It is only available\nin CLI (command-line interface) for the moment.Although the protocol is safe and\nhas been tested extensively, it should still be considered as experimental\nsoftware. Its usage is reserved for advanced users only and no immediate support\nwill be provided from the Particl team or Tecnovert.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s an Atomic Swap\nIf you’re unfamiliar with the term, an “atomic swap” is a special type of \ncross-chain exchange that allows two parties that don’t know each other to\nexchange a currency for another without involving a third-party like an exchange\nor escrow service provider. The process is entirely trustless, meaning that you\ndon’t need to trust the other party to know for certain you won’t get scammed.\nThe integrity of each swap is guaranteed by cryptography.\n\nIn the specific case of this blog post, the “atomic swap” refers to the process\nof safely exchanging Monero for Particl, or Particl for Monero, without the help\nof any third-party.\n\nMonero and Particl Atomic Swap Use Cases\nAlthough this Proof-of-Concept is still only available as a command-line tool\nand reserved for advanced users only, it sets the foundation for future and\ndeeper integrations into the Particl ecosystem. Here are just some of the\nuse-cases the xmrswap protocol enables.\n\nShop online using XMR\nMonero is the world’s most private cryptocurrency. Particl has the world’s most\nprivate marketplace. Both are unstoppable. Then why not combine them and get the\nworld’s most private, unstoppable eCommerce ecosystem?\n\nThe xmrswap protocol can be integrated in such a way that lets you easily swap\nXMR for PART to privately buy anything on the Particl Marketplace without\nleaving any digital footprint. This same integration can be applied to easily\ncash out marketplace sales revenue into Monero and get that extra privacy layer\nwhen leaving the Particl ecosystem.\n\nIncreases Particl’s resiliency\nAdding a more user-friendly interface that easily allows to swap Monero, and\nother cryptocurrencies, for Particl will also increase Particl’s resiliency and\nmake it unstoppable.\n\nThat’s because atomic swaps, other than simply being great tools for privacy,\nsecurity, decentralization, and freedom, also act as a solid fallback solution\nin case of exchange delisting, geographical bans, and other types of restrictive\nmeasures. It reduces the overall influence some third-parties may have over the\nnetwork and allows it to be accessible in perpetuity.\n\nPrivately acquire PART\nA deeper integration into Particl Desktop would allow you to privately acquire\nPART straight from the Particl wallet and without having to forfeit your data to\nanyone, including exchanges, ISPs, and etc.\n\nThis is a particularly strong use-case if you take your privacy seriously as it\nnot only protects your personal information when using the marketplace, but also\nbefore and after using it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat’s Next?\nIntegration of the xmrswapprotocol into Particl Desktop is an entirely separate\ntask and requires other Particl developers other than just Tecnovert to get\ninvolved. As they are currently busy with the Particl V3 release as well as\nother tasks, it is currently not possible to estimate when it will be ready.\n\nThere is, however, some mock ups in the works of how an xmrswap integration may\nlook like in Particl Desktop.
