So let's quickly see what progress has been made in the past\nfew days.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nParticl Desktop ?\nWe've begun integrating the new changes for Particl Desktop 3.3 into the\nclient's front end. As expected, it is leading to a variety of fixes and tweaks\nto the code but it's progressing well.\n\nIntegrating the new changes into the user interface is not expected to be a\nchallenging task, but it's a tedious one as we now need to remove a wide variety\nof long-standing implementations to the GUI that we've carried out for several\ndesktop versions and ensure the new code fits with whatever remains. This means\nupdating everything that depends on those changes and then potentially updating\nany code that depends on that functionality, and so on.\n\nThis integration process is now the main desktop-related task and the last one\nbefore we can release Particl Desktop 3.3 (aside from any testing, as usual).\n\nParticl Core ?\nCore Codebase Maintenance ?️\nCommits · tecnovert/particl-coreParticl Core integration/staging tree.\nContribute to tecnovert/particl-core development by creating an account on\nGitHub.GitHubtecnovert\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master]As usual, we've been\nkeeping up with upstream updates as part of our ever-ongoing effort to maintain\nParticl Core up-to-date with Bitcoin's latest version. You can always keep track\nof those changes by following this link\n[https://github.com/tecnovert/particl-core/commits/master].\n\nParticl Core 24.0 ?\nAs mentioned in previous updates, we are now fully synced to Bitcoin's latest\nupdates and keeping track of its 24.0 release. Once that happens, we'll be ready\nto release Particl Core 24.0 shortly thereafter.\n\nOn that note, we may test out Particl Core 24.0 builds next week and push them\nas pre-release if everything goes well. We'll keep you up-to-date when that is\nthe case.\n\nBasicSwap ?\nWe've now wrapped up all the main components of BasicSwap's GUI and expect to\ncomplete the DEX's initial user interface, in full, this weekend or early into\nnext week. That means that we expect to begin the last round of closed beta\ntesting next week.\n\nFollowing that important milestone, we'll also finish up BasicSwap's website\npublish it a few days into the closed beta testing period, and definitely before\nBasicSwap's open beta release.\n\nStay tuned for more BasicSwap-related news next week on Particl News ?\n\nMajor Particl Academy Update ?️\nParticl Academy — Everything Particl — Particl Academy latest\ndocumentationClaim\nfull digital sovereignty with privacy-first applications that respect your\nrights.

We'd like to implement a couple of extra minor items, such as\nlogging outputs from the front end to the Particl Desktop log file, but we will\nprioritize other more pressing deliverables first. In any case, we expect it to\nbe pretty simple and straightforward to implement when needed.\n\nFor now, we're in the process of re-evaluating some changes on the front end to\nintegrate these new changes neatly in a user-friendly way. Although that is not\nexpected to be a challenging task, it is relatively tedious as we now need to\nremove a wide variety of long-standing implementations to the GUI that we've\ncarried for several desktop versions. That means updating everything that\ndepends on those changes and then potentially updating any code that depends on\nthat functionality, and so on.\n\nSo, generally speaking, everything is continuing along and seeing steady\nprogress.

The proposal\nreceived a resounding 100% approval rate (75% required) with a strong quorum of \n63.2% (20% required)!\n\nNetwork Treasury and Inflation AdjustmentsDr. Kapil Amarasinghe\n[https://ccs.particl.io/proposals/inflation-treasury-adjustments.html]This is\nnothing short of a mandate from the community, and we are moving forward\nimmediately. The team will prepare a mandatory Particl Core update that will\ntrigger a hardfork to:\n\n * Reduce the annual inflation rate from 6% to 3.5%,\n * Eliminate the automated staking reward allocation to the network treasury.\n\nKeep an eye on Particl News and other Particl communications mediums for the\nrelease of this new Particl Core version.\n\nHealthier Economics, Higher Rewards\nThis change marks a significant step forward for the Particl network's long-term\nhealth. In practice, it means that the network's inflation rate will reduce from\n6% to 3.5% while the guaranteed annual staking interest for stakers will\nincrease from 3% to 3.5% for the next year. After that, the coin emission rate\nwill reduce by 0.5% every year until it stabilizes, after 5 years, at a\nsustainable 1% annually.\n\nThis establishes a more balanced and robust economic model, making the network\nprime for the exciting developments ahead.\n\nOur Vision: A Universal, Private Economy\nWhile our current development focus is entirely on BasicSwap DEX, our\nfoundational goal remains unchanged: to build a private and sovereign digital\neconomy with decentralized eCommerce at its core.\n\nAs such, our work on BasicSwap is a strategic and vital step toward that vision.\nWe learned from the initial launch of the Particl Marketplace that requiring the\nuse of PART was a significant barrier to adoption. To build a truly global\nplatform, we must build bridges, not walls, and the marketplace needs to\naccommodate a multitude of coins.\n\nThis is BasicSwap's primary role within the Particl ecosystem; it is the bridge.\n\nBuilding Smarter: How BasicSwap Will Power the New Marketplace\nSome might see our focus on BasicSwap and think development on the marketplace\nhas paused. In reality, the opposite is true: the work we're doing on BasicSwap\nis the direct foundation for the next generation of the Particl Marketplace.\n\nIndeed, we plan on building a completely new and re-imagined marketplace\ncodebase that will be more modern, user-friendly, and accessible. Having learned\nfrom the challenges of the first version and from what made other cryptocurrency\nplatforms successful from an adoption point of view, we're designing this new\niteration with mass adoption in mind. \n\nA lot of the components we build for BasicSwap are modular pieces intended for\nthe new marketplace. For example, our collaboration with the Litecoin Foundation\nis leading us to build a web and mobile-friendly architecture for BasicSwap that\nrelies on light wallets and doesn't require you to run any software locally.\nThis system, sometimes known to as the \"web gateway\" within the Particl\ncommunity, is the foundation that will allow us to deploy the Particl\nMarketplace on mobile and web, removing the need for users to run a full node or\ninstall the marketplace locally.\n\nThis is just one example of how our current efforts are designed to directly\nbenefit the Particl ecosystem, creating a more seamless, powerful, yet intuitive\nmarketplace experience where users can even check out with coins like Monero.\n\nThe Future Role of PART: Value-Added Features\nYou might be asking: \"If PART isn't required to use the marketplace, what is its\npurpose?\"\n\nWithout going into too much details at this point, we are moving to an \"added\nvalue\" model. Using the marketplace will be free and open to all, with no\nrequirement to use PART at all. This is necessary for any kind of broader levels\nof adoption.\n\nHowever, the usage Particl within the marketplace will unlock premium features\nand advanced capabilities, some of which are only possible due to Particl's\ninherent technology. Think of it like powerful software that's free to use but\noffers advanced tools for a fee.\n\nThese features could include:\n\n * Advanced MAD escrow options and premium functionalities on the marketplace,\n * Use of Particl's Confidential Tokens (CTs),\n * Bridges to other blockchains or access to BasicSwap network portals,\n * Etc.\n\nRevenue can then be used to benefit the entire network via a combination of\nredirecting fees to stakers, using them for funding operations, or permanently\nburning them for deflationary purposes (which combines well with the new lower\ninflation rate triggered by the approval of proposal ID #25), depending on the\nsource. \n\nThis strategy allows the platform to attract the widest possible crypto\naudience, giving them a desperately needed way to exchange crypto for tangible\ngoods without middlemen, and simulataneously eliminating the friction of forcing\na native token while still creating powerful but non-intrusive incentives to use\nPART for those who want the best experience.\n\nWhat's Next?\nWe are keeping the specific roadmap for the new marketplace under wraps while we\nfocus on moving BasicSwap out of Beta. This isn't to be vague, but to ensure we\ndeliver a polished, high-quality foundation before revealing the exciting\ndetails that come after this current development phase.\n\nFor now, we invite you to try BasicSwap [https://basicswapdex.com], provide\nfeedback, and help us spread the word. Its success is instrumental to reviving\ndevelopment and interest in the new and improved Particl Marketplace.\n\nThank You!\nWe want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our active staking community and the\nbroader Particl community for participating in this vote with such a convincing\nresult.

we've achieved in the\npast few days and see what we've got to look forward to in the week to come.\n\nNew Development Update Strategy ?\nDevelopment Update (June 2025) | BasicSwap BlogA summary of the recent\ndevelopments and progress made by BasicSwap contributors in June 2025.BasicSwap\nBlog [https://blog.basicswapdex.com/dev-update-june2025/]Today marks the final\nweekly development update to be published on Particl News.
